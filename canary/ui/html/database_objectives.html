<h3>Database Objectives</h3>

<p>
Among the human health scientific community, there has been uncertainty
regarding the importance and relevance of diseases reported in domestic
animals, companion animals, and wildlife, due in part to an unfamiliarity
with the study methods used by animal health researchers. There is a
pressing need to improve communication between the two scientific
communities.
</p>

<p>
One of the recommendations of recent Federal policy initiatives is that
strategies be developed for the more effective use of animal populations
as sentinels of potential environmental health threats. For example, what
are the confirmatory studies which should be done in both animals and
humans to follow-up the reports of a sentinel event? And can wildlife,
companion and domestic animals serve as part of an early warning system
for chemical and biological warfare threats?
</p>

<p>
Another barrier to the use of animal sentinel studies by human health
researchers and practitioners is that the scientific literature regarding
animal sentinels is often difficult to separate from the vast literature
on laboratory animals, and also may appear in journals which are less
familiar to human health professionals.
</p>

<p>
The project aims to address these challenges through the creation of the
Canary Database of animal sentinel studies, classified by study methodology,
species, hazard, and potential human health relevance.
