<h2>Examples of Known Animal Sentinels</h2>


<p>
There are numerous examples of animals serving as a sentinel or
early warning of a human health threat, including canaries warning
coal miners about the presence of carbon monoxide, cats in
Minamata, Japan developing "dancing cat disease" before a widespread
outbreak of mercury poisoning in humans, and dead crows signaling
the appearance of West Nile Virus in the western hemisphere.
