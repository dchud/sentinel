<h3>Our Mission</h3>

<p>
The <b>CANARIES Project</b> aims to protect human health by harnessing the power
of sentinel animal events as early warning signs of human environmental
health hazards. The project achieves this by promoting, coordinating, and
synthesizing scientific studies of sentinel animals published by the
environmental and health science communities.
</p>

<p>
The Project aims to:
</p>

<ul>

<p>
    <li>
Make more accessible the scientific literature on animals as sentinels of
human environmental hazards.
    </li>
</p>

<p>
    <li>
Promote collaborative responses to reports of sentinel events in animal
populations environment by human and animal scientists and public health
professionals.
    </li>
</p>

<p>
    <li>
Improve communication between the disciplines of human environmental
health and animal health, by helping develop a common language of epidemiology
for the study of sentinel health events.
    </li>
</p>

<p>
    <li>
Bring together highly experienced human and animal health professionals,
as well as experts in environmental science and medical informatics.
    </li>
