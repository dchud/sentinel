<h2>Canary Database Mission</h2>

<p>
The Canary Database aims to overcome scientific barriers which
limit the use of animal sentinel data for early recognition of
human environmental health hazards.  These barriers include
difficulty in locating animal sentinel studies in
current biomedical databases and a lack of communication
between human health and animal health professionals.
</p>

<p>
The Canary Database will overcome such barriers by making the
scientific literature on animals as sentinels of human environmental
hazards more accessible in a single location.
