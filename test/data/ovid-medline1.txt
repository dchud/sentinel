AB  - Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are industrial chemicals
      which have been released into the environment resulting in
      widespread and persistent contamination. PCBs exist as 209 different
      congeners depending on the chlorine substitution on the biphenyl
      rings; the physical properties and the toxic effects of a PCB
      congener are structure-dependent. In this work, individual
      ortho-substituted non coplanar PCB congeners were tested for their
      effects on the function of mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis Lam.)
      hemocytes. Moreover, the possibility that in mussel hemocytes
      different PCBs may affect the signal transduction pathways involved
      in the immune response was investigated, with particular regards to
      relevant components of tyrosine-kinase mediated cell signaling. The
      results were compared with those obtained with a model of
      non-ortho-substituted coplanar congener. The results demonstrate
      that the di-ortho-substituted, non coplanar PCB congeners P47
      (2,2',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl) and P153
      (2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl) can alter immune parameters of
      mussel hemocytes, such as microbicidal activity and lysosomal enzyme
      release, respectively. Both congeners, as well as the non-ortho,
      coplanar congener P77 (3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl) significantly
      reduced hemocyte lysosomal membrane stability; however, P77 had no
      effect on either bacterial killing or lysozyme release. P47, P153
      and P77 affected different components of tyrosine kinase-mediated
      cell signalling; in particular, they lead to a time-dependent
      increase in the phosphorylation level of the stress activated p38
      and JNK Mitogen Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs), as evaluated by
      Western blotting of hemocyte protein extracts with specific
      anti-phospho-MAPK antibodies. P153 also increased the level of
      phosphorylated ERK (extracellularly regulated) MAPKs. Moreover, non
      coplanar P47 and P153 caused increased tyrosine phosphorylation of
      the transcription factor STAT5, thus possibly affecting gene
      expression, whereas coplanar P77 was ineffective. The results
      demonstrate that MAPKs, and in particular the stress-activated p38
      and JNK MAPKs, that represents a key step in the response of mussel
      hemocytes to bacterial infection, are a target for different non
      coplanar and coplanar PCB congeners. The results also show
      functional differences between different PCB congeners with respect
      to the hemocyte functions. However, chlorine substitution at the
      ortho positions is not necessarily related to immunotoxicity: the
      hexachlorinated P128 (2,2',3,3',4,4'-hexachlorobiphenyl) had no
      significant effect on mussel hemocytes, whereas its isomer P153,
      that represents a major component of environmental PCBs, and that is
      accumulated in mussel tissues, significantly affected both aspects
      of the immune response and relevant signal transduction pathways.
      These are the first data on the effects and possible mechanisms of
      immunotoxicity of non coplanar PCBs in mussel hemocytes. The results
      support the hypothesis that the innate immune system is a sensitive
      target for these contaminants in both vertebrates and invertebrates.
      Moreover, when considering that non coplanar congeners are present
      both in commercial mixtures and, in higher proportions, in
      environmental samples, the results suggest that bivalve hemocytes
      represent a useful model for evaluating the potential immunotoxicity
      of PCB contamination.

AB  - Samples of Choromytilus chorus (giant mussel) were collected
      at three sampling stations exposed to different degrees of pollution
      along the south-central portion of the Chilean coast in spring 1998
      and summer 1999. Measurements were carried out on clearance rate,
      absorption efficiency, and oxygen consumption of the mussels under
      controlled laboratory conditions, and related to analytical data on
      organic pollutants in their tissues. Scope for growth (SFG) was
      employed as a physiological index to evaluate stress produced by
      pollutants existing at each sampling site. Individuals from San
      Vicente bay (highly polluted) showed negative SFG values in spring
      (-4.6 J/h per g) and summer (-3.5 J/h per g). These results
      indicated severe stress related to the accumulation of toxic
      compounds in their tissues. Specimens from Corral bay (medium level
      of pollution) gave a SFG of 15.5 J/h per g in spring and 6.5 J/h per
      g in summer, while those from Yaldad bay (low pollution) presented
      an inverse situation was observed with SFG values of 6.2 J/h per g
      in spring which was lower than the summer value of 25.7 J/h per g.
      There was a significant negative correlation between the SFG of the
      different populations of C. chorus and the concentrations of
      organochlorines (OChs) and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)
      in their tissues.

AB  - Enforcing the ban on meat-and-bone meal in feed for farmed
      animals, and especially ruminants, is considered an important
      measure to prevent the spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy.
      The authors describe current analytical methods for the detection
      and identification of animal tissues in feed. In addition, recently
      approved requirements, such as the ban of intra-species recycling
      (practice of feeding an animal species with proteins derived from
      the bodies, or parts of bodies, of the same species) are described.
      In principle, four different approaches are currently applied, i.e.
      microscopic analysis, polymerase chain reaction, immunoassay
      analysis and near infrared spectroscopy or microscopy. The principal
      performance characteristics of these methods are presented and
      compared, and their specific advantages and disadvantages described.
      Special emphasis is also placed on the impact of rendering
      conditions, particularly high temperatures and on the use of
      molecular biology techniques. [References: 82]
