AB: 1158 sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs), excised from patients with primary
  cutaneous melanoma, were assessed pathologically using histology with
  immunohistochemistry (IHC) on all nodes, and RT-PCR for Mart-1 and tyrosinase
  on 55 nodes. RT-PCR was compared with the histology and IHC assessed on the
  same nodes. The evaluation of progressively more detailed protocols for
  histology and IHC modulated by the RT-PCR results led to a procedure that
  consistently detects metastases in 34% of patients submitted to SLN biopsy for
  cutaneous melanomas with a vertical growth phase and a mean thickness of 2.02
  mm (range 0.25, with regression, to 19 mm). As this technique is virtually free
  of false positives and produces only a marginally lower detection rate than RT
  -PCR, which was subject to false positives of 7% in our study, it is suggested
  that this extended protocol should be the basis on which further evaluation of
  the place of RT-PCR in SLN assessment takes place. The evolved protocol
  described here has been adopted by the EORTC as the standard procedure for
  pathological handling of sentinel lymph nodes for melanoma when SLN status is a
  criterion in their clinical trials or studies.

AB: At present there are neither clinical nor experimental data available on the
  influence of technical details on the quality and reproducibility of prostate
  lymphoscintigraphy. Six adult fox hounds received repeated transrectal
  ultrasound guided intraprostatic injections of a technetium 99m labeled
  nanocolloid to prove the influence of different techniques of injection (one
  central injection in both prostate lobes vs two peripheral injections in both
  lobes) on tracer accumulation in sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) and other organs.
  The reproducibility of the favored technique was examined and in a last step it
  was subject to scrutiny following a reduction of the injected volume to 1% of
  the prostate volume. The number of scintigraphically visualized SLN varied
  between four and seven. They were located in the region of the internal and
  external iliac vessels, presacrally, paravesically, and directly
  paraprostatically. In five of six cases, the localization was reproducible both
  with the central application of an identical volume as well as with the volume
  reduced central injection. Tracer accumulation of SLNs and other organs varied
  enormously. We expect that with the combination of both injection techniques,
  even with the reduced injection volume, an optimized prostate
  lymphoscintigraphy will be the outcome.

AB: The aim of our study was to detect micrometastatic breast cancer by
  epithelial glycoprotein-2 (EGP-2) and cytokeratin 19 (CK19), using
  immunostaining and real time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase
  chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Fifty-eight breast cancer patients, 52 primary
  tumors, 75 sentinel nodes (SN) and 149 peripheral blood (PB) samples (from
  before, during and 4 days after operation) were examined. Immunostaining was
  performed with antibodies directed against EGP-2 and CK19. Detection limits
  were one Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF-7) breast cancer cell line
  cell/2.106 leukocytes (immunostaining) and one MCF-7 cell/106 leukocytes qRT
  -PCR. Control noncancer lymph nodes (n=10) showed nonspecific CK19 staining,
  but were qRT-PCR negative; control healthy volunteer PB (n=11) was always
  negative. Primary tumor samples, all positive with immunostaining, showed a
  wide variation of EGP-2 (>104 fold) and CK19 mRNA expression (>103 fold). SN
  (n=19) from 16 patients were tumor-positive with routine haematoxylin-eosin
  (H&E) and/or immunostaining. SN tumor presence was positively correlated to qRT
  -PCR expression, but 3 tumor-positive SN were false negative with qRT-PCR.
  Three SN were qRT-PCR positive, while tumor negative with H&E and/or
  immunostaining. No immunostaining positive PB was observed, but 19 patients
  (33%) had one or more qRT-PCR positive PB samples. We concluded that primary
  tumors have varying expressions of EGP-2 and CK19 mRNA. Both markers can be
  used in qRT-PCR to obtain adequate sensitivity for single tumor cell detection.
  In SN, immunostaining appears more sensitive/specific than H&E or qRT-PCR for
  tumor detection. No immunostaining positivity was found in PB, while 33% of
  patients had qRT-PCR positive PB. The clinical value of these findings will
  have to be clarified.

AB: Background: This study examined whether 3D CT imaging with
  lymphoscintigraphy (LSG) is useful when performing sentinel node biopsy (SNB)
  in a community hospital where radioisotope with gamma-probe (RI method) is
  unavailable. Materials and Methods: From June to November 2002, 35 T1/T2
  clinically node-negative breast cancer patients underwent LSG in a university
  nuclear medicine department. Skin areas above LSG hot spots were marked,
  helical CT scanning was performed and axillary 3D images were created in our
  hospital. The SLN predicted from the 3D images were examined for agreement with
  the dye method. Results: SLNs were detected with dye in 32 out of 35 patients
  (91.4%). In 31 of those 32 (96.9%), the SLN predicted from 3D CT images was the
  same. Even in the 3 dye-negative patients, CT imaging predicted the SLN. SNB
  including sampling was successful in 34 patients (97.1%). Conclusion: 3D CT
  imaging with LSG enables SNB even if the RI method is impossible.

AB: Yaws is no longer a national and international health priority for
  intervention, but there is still a negative perception of the disease in the
  few affected communities. A survey in 1988 in the northern region of Ecuador
  documented a prevalence of 16.5% of clinical cases and 96.3% of serological
  cases. A continuous, long-term community-based surveillance programme was
  therefore put in place focusing on yaws as one of the sentinel diseases. The
  results of this intervention are reported here. In 1993, a second survey showed
  a reduction in the prevalence of clinical cases to 1.4% and of serological
  cases to 4.7%. Between 1993 and 1998, no other clinical cases were detected and
  the serological prevalence in 1998 was 3.5%, corresponding with clinical cases
  of primary or congenital syphilis, latent yaws under follow-up, and individuals
  with low serological titres indicating a 'serological scar'. These data
  indicate that yaws has been eliminated. Another important outcome of the
  intervention is the increased self-confidence in the communities that health
  problems can be tackled.

AB: We report the preclinical testing of a synthetic receptor-binding
  macromolecule, (99mTc)DTPA-mannosyl-dextran (36 kDa, 8 DTPA and 55 mannosyl
  units per dextran, KD = 0.12 nM), for sentinel node detection. Nonclinical
  safety studies included cardiac pharmacology safety studies, acute toxicology
  and pathology studies at 50 and 500 times the scaled human dose in both rats
  and rabbits after foot pad administration, and perivascular irritation studies
  in rabbits following intra-muscular administration at 100 and 1000 times the
  scaled human dose. Biodistribution studies in rabbits at 15 m, 1 h, and 3 h
  indicated that (99mTc)DTPA-mannosyl-dextran cleared the hind foot pad with a
  biological half-life of 2.21 +- 0.27 h. Other than mild hepatocyte hypertrophy
  in rabbits, no abnormalities in toxicology or pathology were found. Intravenous
  administration had no effect on survival, any clinical observations,
  electrocardiograms, or blood pressures. Intramuscular injection had no effect
  on survival, clinical observations, injection site observations, or injection
  site histopathology. The estimated absorbed radiation dose to the affected
  breast was 0.15 mGy/MBq and the effective dose was 1.06 X 10-2 mSv/MBq. This
  preclinical study demonstrates that (99mTc)DTPA-mannosyl-dextran has no
  toxicities and has an acceptable biodistribution and radiation dose.

AB: Objective: To monitor HIV-1 and HIV-2 trends in The Gambia, West Africa.
  Methods: In 1993-1995 a nationwide survey among 29 670 pregnant women attending
  eight antenatal clinics estimated the seroprevalence of HIV-1 at 0.6%, and of
  HIV-2 at 1.1%. Five years later, sentinel surveillance in pregnant women was
  established, using unlinked anonymous testing in four clinics. A dried blood
  spot on filter paper was obtained and tested for HIV antibodies. Results:
  Between May 2000 and August 2001, 8054 analysable samples were collected at
  four sites. The prevalence of HIV-1 rose sharply in one rural area from 0.6 to
  3.0% (P < 0.0001), but the increase was small and non-significant in two other
  rural sites and in the urban site. The prevalence of HIV-2 did not change
  significantly at any of the sites. The overall prevalence of HIV-1 was 1.0%
  (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8-1.3%), and of HIV-2 0.8% (CI 0.6-1.0%). Site,
  nationality and higher age were significantly associated with HIV-1 infection,
  and higher parity and site were significantly associated with HIV-2 infection.
  Conclusion: Fifteen years after the first case of HIV-1 was described in The
  Gambia, the epidemic is still at a low level. There is heterogeneity within the
  country, with one rural area experiencing a fivefold increase in 6 years. The
  prevalence of HIV-2 in The Gambia is stable.

AB: Control of Diaprepes abbreviatus by endemic and exotic entomopathogenic
  nematodes (EPN) was monitored during 2000-2001 in two citrus orchards in
  central Florida (Bartow and Poinciana). Caged sentinel insect larvae were
  buried beneath citrus trees for 7 days at 1 to 2-month intervals from April to
  October each year. At Bartow, the survey occurred in experimental plots that
  were (i) not treated with commercial EPN, (ii) treated twice annually since
  1998 with commercially formulated Steinernema riobrave, or (iii) treated twice
  annually with S. riobrave and liquid fertilization (15 times/year) occurred in
  place of dry fertilizer (3 times/year) used in the other treatments. Four
  endemic EPN species, in addition to S. riobrave, were recovered from the sandy
  soil at Bartow: S. diaprepesi, Heterorhabditis zealandica, H. indica, and H.
  bacteriophora. Mean insect mortality in control plots was 39.4% (range=13% to
  74%), with seasonal maxima in May to July each year. Endemic EPN were recovered
  from 55% (range=22% to 81%) of the cadavers each month. Total numbers of
  endemic EPN recovered in all plots during 2 years were directly related to the
  numbers of adult weevils (D. abbreviatus and Pachnaeus litus) captured in
  modified Tedder's traps and inversely related to recovery of S. riobrave.
  Insect mortality was higher and cadavers containing endemic EPN were more
  numerous in untreated control plots than in S. riobrave-treated plots, except
  during months in which S. riobrave was applied. In treated plots, endemic EPN
  were recovered from cadavers at twice the rate of S. riobrave. Suppression of
  endemic EPN in plots treated with S. riobrave, combined with inferior
  persistence by the introduced species, may have attenuated the net efficacy of
  S. riobrave against D. abbreviatus. In contrast, H. indica was the only endemic
  nematode recovered from the sandy clay loam soil at Poinciana, where the
  average mortality of D. abbreviatus was 12% (range 3% to 20%) and incidence of
  H. indica did not exceed 8%. Results of these surveys suggest that the regional
  patterns in the abundance and damage to citrus caused by D. abbreviatus in
  Florida are regulated by endemic EPN and other soilborne enemies of the weevil.

AB: A field study was performed in southern Alberta, Canada, to assess the
  native wasp, Trichomalopsis sarcophagae (Gahan), as a potential biocontrol
  agent for house fly, Musca domestica L., and stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans
  (L.). The wasp was readily reared in large numbers, which allowed for the
  cumulative release of an estimated 4.63 million wasps into three commercial
  feedlots during the 2-year study. Each of several releases predictably and
  repeatedly enhanced parasitism of sentinel house fly pupae, whereas parasitism
  remained low in three paired control feedlots where wasps were not released.
  Releases every 2nd week had a disproportionately greater effect than releases
  every 2nd month. In 1998, 1.2 million wasps were released into treatment
  feedlots resulting in the recovery of 3 952 T. sarcophagae from 31 500 sentinel
  pupae (0.13 wasps/pupa). In 1999, 3.43 million wasps were released into
  treatment feedlots, with the recovery of 37 763 wasps from 47 720 sentinel
  pupae (0.79 wasps/pupa). Hence, a 2.8-fold increase in the number of wasps
  released in 1999 resulted in a 6.1-fold increase in the recovery of wasps. This
  result supports industry recommendations of regular, repeated releases of wasps
  every 2nd or 4th week versus one or infrequent releases throughout the summer.
  There was no evidence that releases augmented overwintering populations of the
  wasp in subsequent years. These results provide proof-of-concept for the mass
  -rearing and release of T. sarcophagae as an inundative biocontrol agent for
  the control of pest flies in cattle confinements. Further studies will be
  required to assess the effect of T. sarcophagae releases on natural populations
  of pest flies.
