AB  - The PI Index is a Szeged-like topological index developed very
      recently. It has useful applications in chemistry which are yet to
      be investigated thoroughly. Herein, we report quantitative
      structure-toxicity relationship (QSTR) study using the PI Index. We
      have used 41 monosubstituted nitrobenzene for this purpose. The
      results have shown that the PI Index alone is not an appropriate
      index for modelling toxicity of nitrobenzene derivatives.
      Combinations of the PI Index with other distance-based topological
      indices resulted into statistically significant models and excellent
      results are obtained in pentaparametric models. The predictive
      potential of the models is discussed on the basis of
      cross-validation method, as well as by estimating root-mean-square
      error (RMS).

AB  - Higher intake of lycopene is related to a lower risk of lung
      cancer in human studies. Lung cancer risk is associated with higher
      plasma levels of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and/or lower
      levels of IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3). However, little is known
      regarding whether lycopene can inhibit cigarette smoke-induced lung
      carcinogenesis through modulation of IGF-I/IGFBP-3, cell
      proliferation, and apoptosis. We investigated the effects of
      lycopene supplementation at a low dose (1.1 mg/kg/day, which is
      equivalent to an intake of 15 mg/day in humans) and a high dose (4.3
      mg/kg/day, which is equivalent to 60 mg/day in humans) on plasma
      IGF-I/IGFBP-3 levels, histopathological changes, proliferating
      cellular nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression, BAD phosphorylation, and
      apoptosis (caspase 3 assay) in lungs of ferrets with or without
      cigarette smoke exposure for 9 weeks. We found that ferrets
      supplemented with lycopene and exposed to smoke had significantly
      higher plasma IGFBP-3 levels (P < 0.01) and a lower IGF-I/IGFBP-3
      ratio (P < 0.01) than ferrets exposed to smoke alone. Both low- and
      high-dose lycopene supplementations substantially inhibited
      smoke-induced squamous metaplasia and PCNA expression in the lungs
      of ferrets. No squamous metaplasia or PCNA overexpression were found
      in the lungs of control ferrets or those supplemented with lycopene
      alone. Furthermore, cigarette smoke exposure greatly increased BAD
      phosphorylation at both Ser(136) and Ser(112) and significantly
      decreased cleaved caspase 3 in the lungs of ferrets, as compared
      with controls. The elevated phosphorylation of BAD and
      down-regulated apoptosis induced by cigarette smoke in the lungs of
      ferrets was prevented by both low- and high-dose lycopene
      supplementations. Lycopene levels were increased in a dose-dependent
      manner in both plasma and lungs of ferrets supplemented with
      lycopene alone. However, lycopene levels were markedly lower in both
      plasma and lungs of ferrets supplemented with lycopene and exposed
      to smoke. Furthermore, smoke exposure increased cis isomers (26% for
      13-cis and 22% for 9-cis) of lycopene in the lungs of ferrets,
      compared with that of ferrets supplemented with lycopene alone (20%
      for 13-cis and 14% for 9-cis). In conclusion, lycopene may mediate
      its protective effects against smoke-induced lung carcinogenesis in
      ferrets through up-regulating IGFBP-3 and down-regulating
      phosphorylation of BAD, which promote apoptosis and inhibit cell
      proliferation.

AB  - A brief overview and comparison is given of dose rates arising
      from natural background radiation and the fallout from atmospheric
      testing of nuclear weapons. Although there are considerable spatial
      variations in exposure to natural background radiation, it is useful
      to give estimates of worldwide average overall exposures from the
      various components of that background. Cosmic-ray secondaries of low
      linear energy transfer (LET), mainly muons and photons, deliver
      about 280 microSv a(-1). Cosmic-ray neutrons deliver about another
      100 microSv a(-1). These low- and high-LET exposures are relatively
      uniform to the whole body. The effective dose rate from cosmogenic
      radionuclides is dominated by the contribution of 12 microSv a(-1)
      from 14C. This is due to relatively uniform irradiation of all
      organs and tissues from low-energy beta particles. Primordial
      radionuclides and their progeny (principally the 238U and 232Th
      series, and 40K) contribute about 480 microSv a(-1) of effective
      dose by external irradiation. This is relatively uniform photon
      irradiation of the whole body. Internally incorporated 40K
      contributes a further 165 microSv a(-1) of effective dose in adults,
      mainly from beta particles, but with a significant gamma component.
      Equivalent doses from 40K are somewhat higher in muscle than other
      soft tissues, but the distinction is less than a factor of three.
      Uranium and thorium series radionuclides give rise to an average
      effective dose rate of around 120 microSv a(-1). This includes a
      major alpha particle component, and exposures of radiosensitive
      tissues in lung, liver, kidney and the skeleton are recognised as
      important contributors to effective dose. Overall, these various
      sources give a worldwide average effective dose rate of about 1160
      microSv a(-1). Exposure to 222Rn, 220Rn and their short-lived
      progeny has to be considered separately. This is very variable both
      within and between countries. For 222Rn and its progeny, a worldwide
      average effective dose rate is about 1105 microSv a(-1). For 220Rn
      and its progeny, the corresponding value is 91 microSv a(-1). In
      both cases, the effective dose is mainly due to a particle
      irradiation of the bronchial tissues of the lungs. Overall, the
      worldwide average effective dose rate from natural background is
      about 2400 microSv a(-1) or 2.4 mSv a(-1). For comparison, worldwide
      average effective dose rates from weapons fallout peaked at 113
      microSv a(-1) (about 5% of natural background) in 1963 and have
      since fallen to about 5.5 microSv a(-1) (about 0.2% of natural
      background). These values perhaps serve to emphasise that even gross
      insults to the natural environment from anthropogenic releases of
      radioactive materials are likely to be of limited significance when
      set in the context of the ambient radioactive environment within
      which all organisms, including humans, have developed. [References:

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The composition of thermal degradation products
      from two types of polyurethane foams, one based on toluene
      diisocyanate (TDI) and the other on diphenylmethane diisocyanate
      (MDI), was analyzed and their toxic lung effects were compared.
      METHODS: Isolated perfused lungs of guinea pig were subjected to
      thermal decomposition products of polyurethane foams from an aerosol
      generator with compartments for diluting, mixing, and sampling.
      RESULTS: Thermal degradation of MDI-based polyurethane foams
      released MDI, phenyl isocyanate, and methyl isocyanate. The emitted
      particulate fraction was 75% for MDI, whereas that for TDI from
      TDI-based polyurethane foam was 3%. Thermal degradation products
      from MDI-based foam caused a pronounced dose-dependent decrease in
      the measured lung function parameters (conductance and compliance).
      In contrast, the thermal degradation products from TDI-based foam
      did not cause any decrease in lung function. CONCLUSIONS: Thermal
      degradation products generated from MDI-based polyurethane foam were
      more toxic to the lung than those generated from TDI-based
      polyurethane foam. This difference was probable due to MDI in the
      particle phase.
