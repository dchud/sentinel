PY: 2003
LA: English
AB: Previous research suggests that free metal concentrations in soils are =
the
  best correlate of the proportion available for uptake, especially by plan=
ts.
  The same may be true for animals which ingest soil, such as earthworms an=
d
  gastropod molluscs. Using predictions from a simple model proposed by Sau=
ve et
  al. [Environ. Pollut. (1997) 149] and based on soil pH and total soil
  concentrations, the relationship between free soil Pb and soft tissue Pb
  concentrations is evaluated in the garden snail Helix aspersa. Five repli=
cate
  adults collected from 23 sites in England and Wales were partitioned into=
 two
  tissue fractions and the relationship between their Pb concentrations and=
 those
  of their native soil was examined using simple regression analysis. Level=
s in
  both fractions rose with free Pb concentrations, but the terms of each
  relationship and its level of significance were greatly influenced by the=
 most
  contaminated soils. Neither tissue fraction served as an effective sentin=
el of
  free soil Pb and the regression coefficient was a poor summary statistic =
across
  sites with a large range of contamination. The same was true of Pb
  concentrations in the whole soft tissues. It may be that free ion
  concentrations are not indicative of metal availability to animals with a=
 range
  of mechanisms to assimilate nutrients, perhaps because of undescribed
  environmental and physiological factors governing assimilation or limitin=
g soft
  tissue concentrations.

PY: 2003
LA: English
AB: The determination of field inactivation rates of Cryptosporidium oocyst=
s in
  sludge and soil is important as many land applications use sludge as a me=
ans of
  fertilizing the soil. Approximately 2.5 x 105 oocysts were spiked into se=
parate
  sentinel chambers containing a 1.0 g mixture of sludge and soil. The sent=
inel
  chambers were exposed to the soil surface environment for 60 days at a de=
pth of
  10 cm in order to evaluate the field inactivation rates of oocysts. The m=
ass
  balance approach was used to determine the number of oocysts lost in the
  experiments. The results of the study showed that oocysts could survive
  environmental stress in soil. The mean inactivation rate of oocysts in th=
e
  sentinel chambers at time intervals of 0 to 17 days, 17 to 30 days, 30 to=
 45
  days, and 45 to 60 days were 0.0045, 0.0033, 0.0043, and 0.012 day-1,
  respectively. Whereas, the mean inactivation rates of oocysts in control =
units
  at time intervals of 0 to 17 days, 17 to 30 days, 30 to 45 days, and 45 t=
o 60
  days were 0.0023, 0.0019, 0.0017, and 0.0025 day-1, respectively. An aver=
age of
  4.8 percent of oocysts were lost in the experiments. Overall, the study
  demonstrated the presence of viable oocysts in sludge samples, which coul=
d
  potentially be used to fertilize agricultural land.

AB: Over the last three decades, special-purpose "entomological" radars hav=
e
  contributed much to the development of our understanding of insect migrat=
ion,
  especially of the nocturnal migrations at altitudes of up to _1 km that a=
re
  regularly undertaken by many important pest species. One of the limitatio=
ns of
  early radar studies, the difficulty of maintaining observations over long
  periods, has recently been overcome by the development of automated units=
 that
  operate autonomously and transmit summaries of their observations to a ba=
se
  laboratory over the public telephone network. These relatively low-cost I=
nsect
  Monitoring Radars (IMRs) employ a novel "ZLC" configuration that allows h=
igh
  quality data on the migrants' flight parameters and identity to be acquir=
ed.
  Two IMRs are currently operating in the semi-arid inland of eastern Austr=
alia,
  in a region where populations of migrant moths (Lepidoptera) and Australi=
an
  plague locusts (Chortoicetes terminifera) commonly originate, and some ex=
amples
  of outputs from one of these units are presented. IMRs are able to provid=
e the
  data needed to characterize a migration system, i.e. to estimate the
  probabilities of migration events occurring in particular directions at
  particular seasons and in response to particular environmental conditions=
 and
  cues. They also appear capable of fulfilling a "sentinel" role for pest
  management organizations, alerting forecasters to major migration events =
and
  thus to the likely new locations of potential target populations. Finally=
, they
  may be suitable for a more general ecological monitoring role, perhaps
  especially for quantifying year-to-year variations in biological producti=
vity.

AB: Objective: To examine the progress made towards the Safe Motherhood
  Initiative goals in 3 areas of the United Republic of Tanzania during the
  1990s. Methods: Maternal mortality in the United Republic of Tanzania was
  monitored by sentinel demographic surveillance of more than 77000 women o=
f
  reproductive age, and by prospective monitoring of mortality in an urban =
site,
  a wealthier rural district, and a poor rural district. The rural district=
s were
  observed between 1992 and 1999, while the urban site was observed between=
 1993
  and 1999. Findings: During the period of observation, the proportion of d=
eaths
  of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) due to maternal causes (PMDF)
  compared with all causes was between 0.063 and 0.095. Maternal mortality =
ratios
  (MMRatios) were 591-1099 and maternal mortality rates (MMRates; maternal =
deaths
  per 100000 women aged 15-49 years) were 43.1-123.0. MMRatios in surveilla=
nce
  areas were substantially higher than estimates from official, facility-ba=
sed
  statistics. In all areas, the MMRates in 1999 were substantially lower th=
an at
  the start of surveillance (1992 for rural districts, 1993 for the urban a=
rea),
  although trends during the period were statistically significant at the 9=
0%
  level only in the urban site. At the community level, an additional year =
of
  education for household heads was associated with a 62% lower maternal de=
ath
  rate, after controlling for community-level variables such as the proport=
ion of
  home births and occupational class. Conclusion: Educational level was a m=
ajor
  predictor of declining MMRates. Even though rates may be decreasing, they
  remained high in the study areas. The use of sentinel registration areas =
may be
  a cost-effective and accurate way for developing countries to monitor mor=
tality
  indicators and causes, including for maternal mortality.

AB: Avian pneumovirus (APV; officially known as turkey rhinotracheitis viru=
s) is
  an emergent pathogen of birds in the USA that results in upper respirator=
y
  tract disease in turkeys. Six years after the first outbreak in the USA, =
the
  disease continues to ravage turkey flocks, primarily in the state of Minn=
esota.
  From 1997 to 2000, the industry recorded losses estimated at US$15 millio=
n per
  annum. Researchers have developed sensitive diagnostic techniques, includ=
ing
  the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the reverse transcriptase-polym=
erase
  chain reaction, which, when used together, are highly sensitive in detect=
ing
  APV outbreaks in commercial turkey flocks. Phylogenetic analysis of the
  nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence of 15 US viruses isolated be=
tween
  1996 and 2000 demonstrated that the US viruses are relatively homogenous =
but
  different from the European APV subgroups A and B, resulting in the
  classification of US isolates into subgroup C. Infectious APV was isolate=
d from
  sentinel waterfowls placed close to an infected commercial turkey farm an=
d from
  wild Canada geese captured in Minnesota, suggesting that free-ranging bir=
ds may
  be involved in the spread of APV. Current efforts to prevent and control =
the
  infection include improving management and biosecurity practices and deve=
loping
  attenuated live and deletion mutant vaccines capable of conferring protec=
tion.

TI: Administration of vaccinia virus to mice may cause contact or bedding

AB: Routine testing of bedding sentinels from a barrier room revealed one m=
ouse
  seropositive to ectromelia virus (EV). Results of haemagglutination inhib=
ition
  testing and western blot analysis were confirmatory for orthopoxvirus
  antibodies. Additional seropositive animals were not identified. Intervie=
ws
  indicated that replication-competent vaccinia virus (VV), Western Reserve
  strain (VV-WR), recently had been given to mice. Although VV-WR was not
  expected to spread by contact or via fomites, the case evidence suggested
  transmission of vaccinia via soiled bedding. In a follow up experiment, 1=
5
  index mice were inoculated with 107 plaque-forming units of VV by either
  subcutaneous or intrarectal instillation. A dedicated contact sentinel an=
d a
  bedding sentinel were provided for each index mouse. All 15 index mice we=
re
  positive for antibodies when tested 22 days after inoculation. One mouse,
  inoculated by the subcutaneous route, appeared ill and developed lesions =
on the
  proximal portion of the tail. The contact sentinel mouse housed with this=
 index
  mouse was the only sentinel to seroconvert. We conclude that VV-WR can sp=
read
  to contact sentinels and potentially to bedding sentinels. The ability of=
 other
  VV strains to be transmitted horizontally and the susceptibility of diffe=
rent
  mouse strains to infection merit further investigation. The use of VV in =
animal
  facilities must be managed carefully since the available serological test=
s do
  not distinguish between VV and EV, an exotic agent of major concern to
  laboratory animal facilities.

LA: English
AB: This article argues that the badger can become infected with TB from ca=
ttle
  via several routes but is extremely unlikely to pass that infection back =
to
  cattle. The true role of the badger in the control of bovine TB should be=
 to
  view it as a sentinel species for the disease. In other words, to assess =
the
  incidence of bovine TB in an area, the badger is a valuable and sensitive=
 bio
  -indicator of the presence of TB in the local cattle population, and not =
the
  source of it. The real wildlife vector of importance in the spread of TB =
in
  cattle is likely to be deer, as other countries have proved.

AB: The presence of chemical contaminants in marine coastal waters is a maj=
or
  subject of concern since many molecules are potentially immunotoxic, even=
 at
  low concentration. During the last decade, studies in sentinel species, s=
uch as
  the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, or the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas=
, have
  revealed that immunosuppressive responses can be related to xenobiotic
  exposure, in the laboratory and in the field. In the present study, Europ=
ean
  flat oysters were experimentally exposed to heavy metals, to investigate
  possible alterations of their immune function. Several hematological and
  functional parameters of hemocytes were measured by flow cytometry, a tec=
hnique
  allowing rapid, sensitive, cell-by-cell measurements in large cell popula=
tions.
  Results reveal a depression of phagocytosis and several subcellular,
  physiological changes in oysters exposed to cadmium alone or to cadmium a=
nd
  copper, suggesting an overall alteration of the phagocytic function.

  results to those of 3 less polluted cities in Mexico. One hundred fifty-t=
wo
  clinically healthy stray mongrel dogs (91 males/61 females), including 43=
 dogs
  from 3 less polluted cities, and 109 from southwest and northeast metropo=
litan
  Mexico City (SWMMC, NEMMC) were studied. Lungs of dogs living in Mexico C=
ity
  and Cuernavaca exhibited patchy chronic mononuclear cell infiltrates alon=
g with
  macrophages loaded with particulate matter (PM) surrounding the bronchiol=
ar
  walls and extending into adjacent vascular structures; bronchiolar epithe=
lial
  and smooth muscle hyperplasia, peribronchiolar fibrosis, microthrombi, an=
d
  capillary and venule polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) margination. Ultr=
afine
  PM was seen in alveolar type I and II cells, endothelial cells, interstit=
ial
  macrophages (Mtheta), and intravascular Mtheta-like cells. Bronchoalveola=
r
  lavage showed significant numbers of alveolar macrophages undergoing
  proliferation. Exposure to complex mixtures of pollutants -- predominantl=
y
  particulate matter and ozone -- is causing lung structural changes induce=
d by
  the sustained inflammatory process and resulting in airway and vascular
  remodeling and altered repair. Cytokines released from both, circulating
  inflammatory and resident lung cells in response to endothelial and epith=
elial
  injury may be playing a role in the pathology described here. Deep concer=
n
  exists for the potential of an increasing rise in lung diseases in child
  populations exposed to Mexico City's environment.

  those from 3 less polluted cities (Cuernavaca, Tlaxcala, and Tuxpam).
  Clinically healthy mongrel dogs, including 109 from highly polluted SWMMC=
 and
  NEMMC, and 43 dogs from less polluted cities were studied. Dogs residing =
in
  cities with lower levels of pollutants showed little or no cardiac
  abnormalities. Mexico City and Cuernavaca dogs exhibited LM myocardial
  alterations including apoptotic myocytes, endothelial and immune effector
  cells, degranulated mast cells associated with scattered foci of mononucl=
ear
  cells in left and right ventricles and interventricular septum, and clust=
ers of
  adipocytes interspersed with mononuclear cells. Vascular changes included
  scattered polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) margination and microthrombi=
 in
  capillaries, and small venous and arteriolar blood vessels. Small veins
  exhibited smooth muscle cell hyperplasia, and arteriolar blood vessels sh=
owed
  deposition of particulate matter (PM) in the media and adventitia. Unmyel=
inated
  nerve fibers showed endoneural and epineural degranulated mast cells. EM
  examination of myocardial mast cells showed distended and abundant rough
  endoplasmic reticulum with few secretory granules. Myocardial capillaries
  exhibited fibrin deposition and their endothelial cells displayed increas=

AB: The first reported cases of HIV-1 infection in South Africa occurred in
  1982. Two distinct HIV-1 epidemic patterns were recognized. Initially the
  infection was prevalent in white males who had sex with males. The HIV-1 =
clade
  B was associated with this group. By 1989, the second epidemic was recogn=
ized
  primarily in the black population. Infections in this case were mainly
  heterosexual in origin. The HIV-1 clade involved was mainly C. The nation=
al HIV
  -1 sero-prevalence in antenatal attendees was less than 1% in 1990 and by=
 1994
  this figure had risen to 7.5%. The most recent antenatal surveillance for=
 HIV-1
  sero-prevalence in 1999 revealed the following. The national prevalence r=
ate
  for 1999 was 22.4% compared with the 1998 rate of 22.8%. The data highlig=
hted
  the profound effect the epidemic had and will have on the disease burden =
in
  South Africa and by extension on the social and economic fronts. This vie=
w was

PY: 2003
LA: English
AB: Objective: The objective of the present review is to assess the impact =
of
  universal salt iodination in Nigeria during the last five years, with ref=
erence
  to some of the sentinel sites studied previously during a 1995 multicentr=
e
  study. Design, setting and subjects: The method of goitre classification =
by
  palpation was employed using the new internationally accepted method in w=
hich
  the classification is simply graded as 0, 1 or 2. The multistage random
  sampling method was used, and state and local government areas were alrea=
dy
  selected by virtue of their known status for iodine deficiency disorders =
(IDD).
  Schools were randomly chosen in each local government area and children a=
ged 8
  -12 years in each school were determined. A percentage of the children wa=
s then
  included in the study to give a sample size greater than the minimum numb=
er
  allotted to the school. A total of 2372 school children (1420 males and 9=
52
  females) in 11 local government areas were examined; urine samples were
  collected from 537 children and analysed for urinary excretion of iodine.=
 The
  method known as the Sandell-Kolthoff reaction was adopted, in which the i=
odide
  in the urine samples catalyses the reduction of ceric ammonium sulfate (y=
ellow
  colour) to the cerous form (colourless) in the presence of arsenious acid=
. The
  degree of reduction in colour intensity of the yellow ceric ammonium sulf=
ate is
  proportional to the iodine content in the urine sample. Results: The medi=
an
  urinary iodine excretion for this sampled population in Nigeria, drawn mo=
stly
  from IDD-endemic areas, was 14.65 =B5g/dl with a mean value of 13.39 =B5g=
/dl.
  Conclusion: Results suggest that Nigeria, in general terms, has achieved =
the
  goal of universal salt iodination and should now focus its attention on
  constant monitoring to sustain this iodination level.

AB: There have been 5 confirmed cases of Murray Valley encephalitis virus (=
MVE)
  infection in the Alice Springs region (Northern Territory, Australia) dur=
ing
  the high rainfall years of 1999/00 and 2000/01, compared with one case in=
 the
  preceding 9 years. There also appeared to be an increased prevalence of R=
oss
  River virus (RR) infection in the Alice Springs and Tennant Creek regions
  associated with high rainfall. This paper presents an analysis of summer
  rainfall from 1990/91 to 2000/01, numbers of seroconversion of sentinel
  chickens to MVE, and RR cases in both regions. In Alice Springs where sum=
mer
  rainfall (December to February) and average vector numbers in the Decembe=
r to
  March period are closely correlated, the analysis also included mosquito =
vector
  numbers and MVE cases. Summer rainfall over 100 mm was significantly asso=
ciated
  with sentinel chicken seroconversions to MVE. From December to March ther=
e was
  also a significant association of average vector numbers (_300) with
  seroconversions in sentinel chickens following high summer rainfall. MVE
  appears enzootic in the Tennant Creek region and epizootic in the Alice S=
prings
  region. In Alice Springs during December to March, there was a significan=
t
  association of RR cases with rainfall over 100 mm and with average vector
  numbers over 300. There was also a significant correlation of summer rain=
fall
  with RR cases in Tennant Creek. Summer rainfall is a new and good early
  indicator of high risk for both MVE and RR disease in the Alice Springs
  locality and RR in the Tennant Creek locality. Although similar relations=
hips
  between rainfall and vector abundance, and disease incidence probably exi=
st in
  other areas of central Australia, rainfall and vector abundance threshold=
s will
  probably vary according to local climatic and environmental conditions.

an

dairy
  cows with protothecal mastitis were examined for shedding of algae cells =
and
  for local immune responses three times in 6-month intervals. During acute=
 and
  chronic stages of protothecosis, significantly elevated specific antibody

  70.5% of the persistently infected animals were continuously shedding the

  18% of the cows were tested culturally negative throughout the study. It =

AB: Pandemic influenza is a zoonosis. Studies on influenza ecology conducte=
d in
  Hong Kong since the 1970s in which Hong Kong essentially functioned as an
  influenza sentinel post indicated that it might be possible, for the firs=
t
  time, to have influenza preparedness at the baseline avian level. This
  appreciation of influenza ecology facilitated recognition of the H5N1 'bi=
rd
  flu' incident in Hong Kong in 1997 in what was considered to be an incipi=
ent
  pandemic situation, the chicken being the source of virus for humans and,=
 if
  so, was the first instance where a pandemic may have been averted. The 20=
01 and
  2002 H5N1 incidents demonstrated that it was possible to have an even hig=
her
  order of baseline preparedness with the recognition in chicken of a range=
 of
  genotypes of H5N1-like viruses before they had the opportunity to infect
  humans. Investigations of these incidents revealed a complex ecology invo=
lving
  variously precursor avian H5N1 virus in geese and ducks, and H9N2 and H6N=
1
  viruses in quail, the quail possibly functioning as an avian 'mixing vess=
el'
  for key genetic reassortment events for onward transmission of H5N1 virus=
es
  highly pathogenic for chicken and humans. These findings highlight the
  importance of systematic virus surveillance of domestic poultry in recogn=
izing
  changes in virus occurrence, host range and pathogenicity as signals at t=
he
  avian level that could presage a pandemic. For example, there is now an
  increasing prevalence of avian influenza viruses in terrestrial (in contr=
ast to
  aquatic) poultry. Prior to 1997, no particular virus subtype other than H=
4N6
  would have been considered a candidate for pandemicity and this was based=
, in
  the absence of any other data, on its high frequency of occurrence in duc=
ks in
  southern China. Now, with the isolation of H5N1 and H9N2 viruses from hum=
ans
  supported by genetic, molecular and biological studies on these and other=
 avian
  isolates, there is credible evidence for the candidacy, in order, of H5N1=
, H9N2
  and H6N1 viruses. These viruses have been made available for the producti=
on of
  diagnostic reagents and exploratory vaccines. The 1997 incident upheld th=
e
  hypothesis that southern China is an epicentre for the emergence of pande=
mic
  influenza viruses. However, the intensification of the poultry (chicken)
  industry worldwide coupled with the spread of viruses such as the Eurasia=
n
  lineage of H9N2 suggest that the genesis of a pandemic could take place
  elsewhere in the world. This re-emphasizes the importance of systematic v=
irus
  surveillance of poultry globally for international public health and for
  economic and food concerns. Faced with an incipient pandemic in 1997, Hon=
g Kong
  brought in international experts to join the investigative effort. Good
  teamwork at all levels is essential in dealing with the many facets. The =
threat
  of a pandemic should not be minimized, nor should governments be lulled i=
nto a
  sense of false security. The media is a powerful channel and has the
  responsibility and the avenues to convey and influence public perception =
of
  events. Close liaison between the media and those on the operational side
  ensures effective, accurate and timely dissemination of information. This=
 will
  enhance public confidence in the investigative process and in steps taken=
 for
  its safety and health.

AB: There have been significant strides in our knowledge of the effects of
  toxicants on birds. This communication presents a brief review of avian
  toxicology with emphasis on effects of common toxicants that disrupt endo=
crine
  system function and control of reproduction, growth, development, stress =
and
  calcium-phosphorus homeostasis. For those hormonal systems that act throu=
gh
  hypothalamic-pituitary axes, we emphasize current knowledge at the axis '=
level'
  wherein the toxicants alter endocrine control. The classes of toxicants
  discussed are acid rain and/or aluminium, organochlorines such as
  polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), fungicides and insecticides, mycotoxins=
,
  (PCBs) and petroleum. The use of several types of avian models for endocr=
ine
  disruption studies is discussed in the context of utility and practicalit=
y,
  developmental modes, species sensitivity and the choice of sentinel speci=
es.
  Promising new approaches for avian toxicological research are considered
  including shell-less embryos, continuous-flow administration of toxicants=
 to
  avian embryos, gene microarrays, proteomics and metabolomics.

  Anagrus wasps in commercial vineyards in New York, U.S.A. We established =
three
  cover crops between vine rows in a commercial vineyard: buckwheat (Fagopy=
rum
  esculentum (Moench)), clover (Trifolium repens L.) and mowed sod (Dactyli=
s
  glomerata L.). There was no effect of cover crop on adult Anagrus in 1996=
,
  whereas in 1997 adults were more abundant within edge vines with buckwhea=
t
  compared to vines with clover or sod; adults were more abundant at the vi=
neyard
  edge, especially early in the season. Parasitism of 'sentinel' leafhopper=
 eggs
  was higher on vines with buckwheat compared to parasitism on vines with c=
lover
  or sod in 1996; a similar, non-significant trend, was observed in 1997. N=
either
  the abundance nor the distribution of leafhoppers was influenced by cover
  crops, although in 1997 there was a trend toward greater numbers of nymph=
s on
  edge vines with buckwheat. In a cage experiment, parasitism by Anagrus of
  leafhopper eggs on grapes was greater when adults had access to flowering
  buckwheat rather than buckwheat without flowers. In a laboratory study,
  longevity of female Anagrus was increased when provided with honey or sug=
ar
  water compared to water only or nothing. Our results suggest that parasit=
ism of
  grape leafhoppers by Anagrus may be enhanced by providing floral resource=

AB: The occurrence of vesicular stomatitis (VS) was investigated in El Salv=
ador
  through monthly visits to 12 sentinel cattle operations located in four
  different departments. Management, environmental, and spatial data were
  collected. Heifers were enrolled on the operations and were examined and =
bled
  monthly for 3 years. Two competitive ELISAs were used to detect antibodie=
s on
  each sample for each serotype of VS virus (VSV). On 8 of the 12 operation=
s,
  small terrestrial rodents were trapped, blood samples collected, and anti=
bodies
  to both VS serotypes evaluated using a serum-neutralization test for each=
 virus
  serotype. Similar to other studies of VS in Central America, the seroprev=
alence
  of the New Jersey serotype was higher than the seroprevalence to the Indi=
ana
  serotype. An outbreak of VS appeared to occur in the Department of Sonson=
ate in
  the summer of 1999. We confirmed that VS is endemic in the four departmen=
ts
  investigated in El Salvador.

AB: Although cardioviruses related to Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis vi=
rus
  (TMEV) appear to be common in mice and rats, few TMEV isolates have been
  obtained from rat colonies. In 1991, a cardiovirus isolate designated NGS=
910
  was obtained from sentinel rats exposed to cage bedding previously used b=
y
  adult rats that were TMEV seropositive, but had never manifested clinical=
 signs
  of disease. To determine to which group and subgroup of cardiovirus this =
virus
  belongs, the sequence of the viral genome was determined. The NGS910 geno=
me
  consisted of 8,021 nucleotides and the 5'-nontranslated region had a pred=
icted
  secondary structure that is similar to members of the TMEV group of
  cardioviruses. The Leader-P3D open reading frame (L ORF) of NGS910 had st=
rong
  homology with L ORFs of other TMEVs (72% identity), but lower homology wi=
th
  EMCV cardioviruses (55 to 56%). Phylogenetic analyses on the basis of ali=
gned
  nucleotide sequences of the L ORF (6,924 b) and the internal L* ORF (471 =
b)
  supported this classification of NGS910 as a TMEV strain. However, within=
 the
  TMEV group, NGS910 was sufficiently divergent from other isolates that it=
 could
  not be regarded as simply a mutant strain of a known TMEV. As genetic dis=
tances
  between NGS910 and other TMEVs were greater than those between Mengo viru=
s of
  EMCV and other EMCVs, we propose to designate the NGS910 isolate as a rat
  Theiler-like virus.

AB: The greatest burden of HIV infection in women and their children is
  disproportionately borne by the poorest countries, especially in sub-Saha=
ran
  Africa. Breast feeding is a major health-promoting factor for infants and
  children in developing countries but the risk of mother-to-child transmis=
sion
  (MTCT) of HIV by this route is challenging traditional practices and heal=
th
  policies in low-resource countries. Maternal and infant factors contribut=
ing to
  the risk of MTCT through breast feeding are still poorly understood and n=
ot
  well researched. Factors identified include: advanced clinical stages of
  infection in the mother; high maternal plasma HIV-1 load; presence of mas=
titis;
  and infant oral thrush. In many developing countries, international agenc=
ies
  are providing support and recommendations for preventing MTCT of HIV-1 by
  breast feeding. Preventive strategies supported by WHO/UNICEF and charita=
ble
  agencies in some sentinel centres in sub-Saharan Africa include routine
  antenatal voluntary counselling and testing (VCT), PCR testing of infants=
 of
  seropositive mothers at 6 weeks of age, various combinations of a shorten=
ed
  period (3-6 months) of exclusive breast feeding, perinatal administration=
 of
  antiretrovirals (ARV) such as nevirapine and provision of affordable and =
safe
  infant replacement feeds (presently given free by UNICEF in some centres)=
. Many
  problems, however, have hindered effective implementation of these
  interventions. In many poor communities, even where VCT facilities are
  available, acceptance of HIV testing is low because there is fear of
  stigmatization by the spouse, family or community and compliance with com=
plex
  drug regimens is therefore poor. Other problems include the exorbitant co=
st of
  antiretroviral drugs, inadequately resourced health care systems and
  unavailability or poor acceptance of safe breast milk alternatives. The r=
ate of
  mixed feeding is high and so the risk of MTCT is increased. Continued pro=
motion
  of exclusive breast feeding for at least 6 months, irrespective of HIV st=
atus,
  followed by a properly prepared, high energy, nutritious complementary di=
et,
  with the possibility of early weaning to an animal milk formula, still ap=
pears
  to be the most appropriate option for the poor in countries with high lev=
els of
  MTCT not deriving any benefit from the above strategies. While a longer p=
eriod
  of breast feeding would probably increase the risk of MTCT in vulnerable
  communities, a shorter duration would certainly increase infant morbidity=
 and
  mortality. Results of investigations of the efficacy of ARV for protectin=
g the
  infants of HIV-infected mothers during the breast feeding period are awai=
ted.

AB: The Madison River, Montana, is the site of a whirling disease epizootic
  among rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss caused by the parasite Myxobolus
  cerebralis. We investigated how the timing and location of the spawning a=
nd
  rearing of rainbow trout influences the risk of exposure to the parasite.
  Sentinel fish exposures were used to assess the spatial and temporal vari=
ation
  in disease severity in 1998 and 1999. Redd counts, radiotelemetry of spaw=
ning
  rainbow trout, and electrofishing estimates of fry abundance indicated th=
at
  during the critical 2-3-month posthatch period, when rainbow trout are mo=
st
  susceptible to whirling disease, the majority of fry in the Madison River
  population are concentrated within a relatively small portion of the uppe=
r
  drainage. Disease severity ranged from low to very high in this area of t=
he
  river. Large temporal variation in disease severity was also evident: sev=
erity
  was significantly higher in the spring than in the fall and in 1999 than =
in
  1998. These data indicate that the effects of whirling disease on rainbow=
 trout
  populations are governed by a complex interaction between the timing and
  location of key life history events (spawning, emergence, and early reari=
ng)
  and the spatial and temporal variation in the presence of the infectious =
stages
  of M. cerebralis. Life history diversity within rainbow trout populations=
 may
  therefore help buffer the effects of whirling disease and help explain wh=
y
  population-level effects are so variable among infected populations.

AB: We determined the composition and organization of avian mixed-species
  foraging flocks during the non-breeding season from April to August 2000 =
in a
  high-Andean forest fragment of Polylepis besseri (Rosaceae) (3710-3880 m
  a.s.l., 11 ha) in Cochabamba, Bolivia. Forest birds were colour-banded mo=
nthly
  starting December 1999. Sixty-three observations of flocks were made cont=
aining
  a total of 10 species with a mean (=B1SD) of 2.8=B10.9 species and 5.4=B1=
1.8
  individuals per flock. The entire Polylepis bird community contained 30 c=
ore
  species. Since the forest was small, most flocks contained at least some =
of the
  same individuals. Three species occurred in > 70% (Giant Conebill Oreoman=
es
  fraseri, Tawny Tit-Spine-tail Leptasthenura yanacensis, and White-throate=
d
  Tyrannulet Mecocerculus leucophrys, with 2.6=B10.6, 1.9=B10.6, and 1.6=B1=
0.5
  individuals per flock, respectively), one species (Asthenes dorbignyi wit=
h
  1.4=B10.5 individuals per flock) in 21%, and the remaining six species in=
 =A3 5% of
  all flocks. All flock participants except one were insectivores. Individu=
als of
  O. fraseri showed high intraspecific group or pair fidelity and often, bu=
t not
  always, acted as flock leader, whereas the sentinel role was mainly assum=
ed by
  L. yanacensis or A. dorbignyi. For the three species regularly associated=
 with
  mixed-species flocks, home ranges of banded individuals observed in flock=
s were
  determined. Mean home ranges (100% minimum convex polygons) were 6.13=B10=
.87 ha
  for O. fraseri (n=3D4), 2.13=B11.26 ha for L. yanacensis (n=3D6), and 3.4=
1=B12.73 ha
  for M. leucophrys (n=3D3). Intraspecific home range overlap was moderate =
to high
  in all species, clear associations of Tawny Tit-Spinetail and White-throa=
ted
  Tyrannulet individuals with one of the two Giant Conebill pairs/groups we=
re
  lacking, and agonistic interactions were almost absent except in August. =
In
  other words, neither individuals nor flocks were territorial, and flocks =
were
  much more loosely structured than those studied in Neotropical lowlands,
  resembling in some respect mixed-species flocks in northern temperate zon=
es.
  Selective advantages of mixed flocks in Polylepis forests are briefly
  discussed, finding support only for the predation avoidance hypothesis.

AB: Vectorial capacity of C. sonorensis for the transmission of bluetongue =
(BLU)
  virus was examined at a dairy in southern California, USA from January 19=
95 to
  December 1997. Insects were collected one to two times per week in five C=
DC
  -type suction traps (without light) baited with CO2 at a constant release=
 rate
  of 1000 ml/minutes. BLU virus was detected in midges collected from May t=
hrough
  December with an estimated overall infection rate of 0.08%. The BLU virus
  infection rate of field-captured midges was not correlated with sentinel =
calf
  seroconversions to BLU virus. Sentinel calf seroconversions were highly
  seasonal, occurring from August through November with most calves
  seroconverting during September and October. Vector competence of field
  -collected nulliparous flies fed a locally acquired serotype of BLU virus=
 in
  the laboratory was stable among years (17-23%). Vectorial capacity was st=
rongly
  correlated with BLU virus transmission (measured by sentinel calf
  seroconversions) during 1995 and 1996, but not during 1997. Host biting r=
ate
  estimated for traps nearest to the sentinel calves was the index best
  correlated with BLU virus transmission for all study years and was most h=
ighly
  correlated with sentinel seroconversions 4 weeks later. The utility of
  vectorial capacity and its component variables is discussed for this syst=

AB: Zimbabwe, like most countries in southern Africa, has one of the most
  devastating HIV epidemics seen to date. According to available informatio=
n, HIV
  is thought to have begun to spread rapidly within Zimbabwe in the mid-198=
0s
  with adult HIV prevalence reaching approximately 9% by 1990. The most rec=
ent
  published sentinel surveillance figures for Zimbabwe suggest that the nat=
ional
  level of HIV prevalence among women attending antenatal clinics increased=
 from
  29% in 1997 to 35% in 2000. Even after adjusting for likely selection bia=
s in
  sentinel sites, it was estimated that HIV prevalence amongst adults in Zi=
mbabwe
  had increased from 25% to 30% during the intervening 3-year period. In tr=
ying
  to explain this trend most analysts have focused on behavioural and
  sociological aspects of why HIV has spread so rapidly in southern Africa.=
 These
  include studies on patterns of infection and demographic impact by socio
  -demographic risk group and relative levels of HIV infection among more a=
nd
  less educated people. A comprehensive review of HIV/AIDS in southern Afri=
ca has
  recently been produced covering a broad perspective of the problem, rangi=
ng
  from epidemiology, psychosocial and cultural determinants, government pol=
icies
  and country level experiences.

AB: Background: Data from sentinel serosurveillance are useful to estimate =
HIV
  infection in populations but may not be representative of the general
  population. General population-based surveys attempt to avoid selection b=
ias
  and are the most appropriate for tracking changes in exposure to risk of =
HIV
  infection over time and assessing changes in behaviour following preventi=
on
  campaigns. Objectives: To provide baseline data for targeted sexually
  transmitted infection (STI) and HIV infection prevention interventions by
  studying parameters of sexual behaviour and knowledge of HIV infection an=
d
  STIs, measuring health-seeking behaviour related to STIs, and measuring
  gonorrhoea, Chlamydia, syphilis, and HIV-1 prevalences. Design: Populatio=
n
  -based survey with stratified sampling by age group from randomly selecte=
d
  households in a suburb of Mombasa, Kenya. Methods: A standard questionnai=
re was
  administered to 1497 consenting adults between the ages of 15 and 49 year=
s who
  lived in randomly selected households. Urine and blood samples were obtai=
ned
  for the estimation of gonorrhoea, chlamydial infection, syphilis, and HIV=
-1
  infection prevalences. Results: Sexual activity in the past 12 months was
  limited to one partner in all age groups for most sexually active men (68=
%) and
  women (88%). More men than women reported two or more partners in the pas=
t 12
  months (23% vs. 5%, respectively). Almost one half of those persons in th=
e 15-
  to 19-year-old age group (56% of boys and 48% of girls) were sexually act=
ive.
  Condom use was low with all sexual partners, more so for women than for m=
en.
  Reported STI symptoms in the past 12 months were high for both men and wo=
men.
  Knowledge of STI symptoms and HIV infection was present but incomplete. O=
verall
  HIV seroprevalence was 10.8%, with significantly higher rates among women
  (13.7%) than among men (8.0%). HIV seroprevalence in the 15- to 19-year-o=
ld age
  group was 3.2%. Female gender, Protestant religion, Catholic religion, an=
d
  being divorced, separated, and widowed were significantly associated with=
 HIV
  seroprevalence. Prevalences of gonorrhoea, chlamydial infection, and syph=
ilis
  were 0.9%, 1.5%, and 1.3%, respectively. Conclusions: This study emphasiz=
es the
  vulnerability of young adults, in particular young women, to HIV infectio=
n and
  the need for intensive interventions in this group. The low use of condom=
s,
  incomplete knowledge of HIV infection and STIs, the high number of report=
ed
  STIs, and the relatively low HIV-1 seroprevalence among the 15- to 19-yea=
r-old
  group indicate a large need for intensive STI and HIV infection preventio=
n
  programmes, especially for the 15- to 19-year-old age group.

AB: The range of the native butterfly Pieris virginiensis Edwards has decre=
ased
  in New York and Ontario since the 1940s. Loss of habitat and harm from Co=
tesia
  glomerata (L.), a braconid parasitoid introduced to North America in the =
late
  nineteenth century for biological control of the invasive pest butterfly =
Pieris
  rapae (L.), have been suggested as the causes of this decline. In western
  Massachusetts, extensive habitat suitable for P. virginiensis remains and=
 its
  principal host plant, Cardamine diphylla, is common. We found P. virginie=
nsis
  to be widely present, occurring at 39% of host plant patches. In laborato=
ry
  tests, we found that both C. glomerata and Cotesia rubecula (Marshall) ar=
e able
  to parasitize and successfully develop in P. virginiensis larvae when the=
se are
  presented on detached leaves of C. diphylla. However, when we exposed
  laboratory-reared first or second instars of either P. rapae or P. napi (=
both
  suitable hosts for these Cotesia spp.) as sentinel larvae on leaves of ei=
ther
  Brassica oleracea or C. diphylla at sites where P. virginiensis was prese=
nt, no
  parasitism by either Cotesia sp. was detected. Some sentinel larvae were
  parasitized by an unidentified ichneumonid in the genus Hyposoter. We con=
clude
  that in western Massachusetts, P. virginiensis is widely distributed at l=
ow
  densities and that while it is physiologically an acceptable and suitable=
 host
  for both C. glomerata and C. rubecula, larvae of field populations of thi=
s
  butterfly are not attacked because these parasitoids do not forage in for=
ested
  habitats, even when they are locally present in adjacent meadows. Consequ=
ently,
  we report that this butterfly is not threatened by these parasitoids cont=
rary
  to early suggestions in the literature.

AB: Reasons for performing study: Horses vaccinated against common agents o=
f
  infectious upper respiratory disease (IURD) may not have detectable serum
  antibody and may not be protected from clinical disease. Objectives: The
  objectives of this study are the following: (1) investigate the serologic=
al
  response of horses to vaccination against influenza virus (H3N8 and H7N7)=
 and
  equine herpesviruses (EHV) in a field setting; and (2) evaluate associati=
ons
  among vaccination status, serum antibody concentrations, and occurrences =
of
  IURD in monitored horses. Methods: In this study, horses on 6 Colorado pr=
emises
  were vaccinated parenterally against influenza virus and EHV, and serolog=
ical
  response evaluated. Horses were monitored, and biological samples collect=
ed
  from individuals with clinical IURD and control horses (USA). Results: Of=
 173
  horses, 61 (35.3%), 21 (12.1%) and 4 (2.3%) seroconverted in response to
  vaccination against EHV, influenza virus H7N7 and influenza virus H3N8,
  respectively. Conclusions: Outbreaks of IURD in study horses were associa=
ted
  with influenza virus H3N8 and Streptococcus equi infection, and serologic=
al
  response to vaccination with conventional products was poor. Potential
  relevance: These results confirm that horses may not respond with detecta=
ble
  serological responses to conventional vaccination against common respirat=
ory
  viruses and, therefore, suggest that alternate methods of protecting hors=
es
  against common respiratory viruses should be sought.

  Sounds, New Zealand where TB was known to be present. The pigs were radio

pigs
  successfully recovered and necropsied, one killed 2 months after release =
had no
  gross lesions typical of TB, and the only other pig killed at that time h=

 in
  the forest, with minimum convex polygon range-size estimates averaging 10=

  (range 4.7-20.3 km2) for the pigs killed after 6 months. A 6-km radius ar=

AB: Epizootic avian vacuolar myelinopathy (AVM) was first recognized as a
  neurologic disease in bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and American=
 coots
  (Fulica americana) in Arkansas, USA in 1994 and 1996, respectively, but
  attempts to identify the aetiology of the disease have been unsuccessful =
to
  date. Between 1998 and 2001, wing clipped sentinel birds (wild American c=
oots
  and game farm mallards [Anas platyrhynchos]) were released at Lake Surf, =
North
  Carolina, USA, a lake with recurrent outbreaks of AVM, in order to gain a
  better understanding of the epizootiology of the disease. As early as 5-7=
 days
  post-release, sentinel coots and mallards showed neurologic signs of dise=
ase
  and were confirmed with AVM upon histologic examination of their brains. =
Serial
  releases of sentinel mallards during the summer, fall, and winter of 2000=
-01
  demonstrated that exposure to the causative agent at a threshold sufficie=
nt to
  manifest disease was seasonal and occurred over about a 2-month period, d=
uring
  November and December. Our findings that disease onset can be very rapid =
(5-7
  days) and that exposure to the causative agent of AVM is site-specific,
  seasonal (late fall to early winter), and occurs over a relatively short
  duration (several months) supports the hypothesis that the disease is cau=
sed by
  a chemical substance, most likely of natural origin.

  Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) virus during the 2000 wet season. Highes=
t-on
  -record rainfall throughout much of the state during the 2000 wet season =
gave
  rise to extensive mosquito breeding and increased MVE virus transmission,
  resulting in 9 cases of encephalitis. Activity of MVE virus in Western
  Australia is monitored by detecting MVE virus-specific antibodies in seru=
m from
  sentinel fowls, located at towns and communities throughout the north of =
the
  state. However, during 2000, all 28 flocks of fowls seroconverted to MVE =
virus,
  including a flock located > 600 km further south than MVE virus activity =
had
  ever previously been recorded. Furthermore, the majority of the 9 cases o=
f
  encephalitis occurred outside the enzootic Kimberley region. We therefore
  undertook a major serosurvey of domestic fowl flocks both south and east =
of the
  previously defined regions of virus activity. The results suggest that MV=
E
  virus activity extended as far south as the Midwest and northern Goldfiel=
ds
  during 2000. A new southern limit of activity of MVE virus is therefore
  proposed. The results have implications for managing outbreaks of MVE vir=
us in
  Western Australia and have enabled us to locate additional sentinel flock=

AB: We performed experimental infection in 10-week-old pigs with the Paderb=
orn
  isolate of classical swine fever virus (CSFV). Despite being epidemiologi=
cally
  linked to the major CSFV outbreak in The Netherlands in 1997, the in vivo
  replication kinetics of this isolate have to our knowledge not been descr=
ibed
  in detail previously. We found that oronasal infection with 104.7 TCID50
  produced mortality in three out of five pigs after 29-31 days, and severe
  clinical symptoms in one out of five pigs, while one out of five pigs exh=
ibited
  no clinical symptoms. At this infection dose, pigs had viral RNA (monitor=
ed by
  quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR) in serum as soon as 2 days
  postinfection, and excretion of infectious virus (monitored by sentinel p=
igs)
  appeared to be virtually concomitant with viraemia onset. While virus RNA=
 was
  cleared from the serum of most pigs after 1-2 weeks, some pigs had viral =
RNA in
  serum for more than 30 days, and exhibited only mild clinical symptoms. W=
e
  observed an excellent correlation between clinical symptoms and viral RNA=
 loads
  in serum, while serum antibody levels were low. Clinically affected pigs =
had up
  to 1000-fold higher serum viral RNA loads than did pigs without clinical
  symptoms. At this level of infection, and this age group, the Paderborn i=
solate
  exhibited a strikingly wide range of replication patterns, which might be
  relevant to the spread of the virus through susceptible pig populations, =
and
  the severity of the 1997-98 outbreak.

AB: Several studies in sub-Saharan Africa have reported that HIV prevalence=
 in
  young women is higher than in young men. We used data from Kenya HIV sent=
inel
  surveillance conducted from 1990 to 2001 among sexually transmitted disea=
se
  (STD) patients (15-49 years old) to investigate consistency of gender
  differentials over time and their risk factors. Of the 15889 STD patients=
, the
  HIV prevalence ranged from 16.0% in 1990 to 41.8% in 1997. The odds ratio=
s
  (ORs) of HIV infection for women compared to men decreased by age; women =
15-24
  years were nearly twice as likely as men of the same ages to be HIV infec=
ted
  (OR, 1.7; 95% CI: 1.5-2.0), but risk in those > 44 years was almost equal=
 (OR,
  0.8; 95% CI: 0.7-1.2). The odds of HIV infection for women compared to me=
n were
  twice in unmarried patients (OR, 2.1; 95% CI: 1.8-2.3). This association
  persisted after controlling for age groups or marital status, residence, =
level
  of education and presence of STD syndromes. This pattern had been consist=
ent
  over 12 years. It is suggested that adolescent women with symptoms of STD=
s
  should be a focus for the HIV/STD intervention programmes because of thei=
r high
  risk for HIV.

AB: The egg parasitoid Trichogramma brassicae Bezdenko was introduced from
  Moldavia to western Europe some 30 years ago and since then has been
  inundatively released to control the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubila=
lis
  Hubner, in maize. We investigated parasitism of non-target butterfly eggs=
 by T.
  brassicae in field cages and under field conditions in Switzerland. Paras=
itism
  of eggs (exposed for 24 h) of six non-target species (Papilio machaon L.,
  Clossiana selene Denis and Schiffermuller, Maniola jurtina L., Melanargia
  galathea L., Hipparchia alcyone Denis and Schiffermuller, Cyaniris semiar=
gus
  Rottemburg) in field cages of 2 x 2 x 2 m ranged between 2.5 and 18.7% wh=
en
  based on a relative high number of released parasitoid females (780=B1273
  SD/cage). This number is 16-fold more compared to agricultural practices
  (120000/ha). As a control, Ephestia kuehniella Zeller eggs were glued on =
the
  same plant. A difference in parasitism rates between the non-target speci=
es and
  E. kuehniella was only observed for M. galathea. During inundative releas=
es of
  T. brassicae in maize, sentinel eggs of two suitable non-target hosts and=
 of E.
  kuehniella were exposed for 72 h. Parasitism rates of E. kuehniella egg m=
asses
  inside maize fields averaged 40% compared to significantly lower parasiti=
sm
  rates of 26.2 and 12.6% for eggs of H. alcyone and M. galathea. At 2 m di=
stance
  from the maize field, parasitism rates decreased to 2.3% for M. galathea,=
 6.1%
  for H. alcyone, and 9.8% for E. kuehniella while no single egg was found
  parasitized at 20 m distance from the release fields. We conclude that,
  although the tested non-target butterflies were all attacked under semi-f=
ield
  and field conditions, effects on non-target butterflies due to mass relea=
sed T.
  brassicae are minimal.

AB: The effects of air quality with three levels of ozone (O3) were studied=
 on
  three cabbage cultivars (Caramba, Sentinel and Othelo) during a one month
  exposure period in the Valencia, Spain using modulated chlorophyll a
  fluorescence, lipid peroxidation and solute leakage. Increasing O3 exposu=
re
  reduced the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II photochemistry (Fv/Fm=
) in
  line with a reduction in non-cyclic electron flow (phiPSII), lower capaci=
ty to
  reduce the quinone pool (qP) and a decrease in the potential photosynthet=
ic
  quantum conversion, Rfd ratio. These reductions were more evident in Cara=
mba
  and Sentinel varieties but lower in Othelo. Ozone and its oxidative deriv=
ates
  weakened the plasmalemma, which caused a leakage of cellular liquids into
  intercellular spaces. In our results, ion leakage increased with O3
  concentration. Moreover, data from thiobarbituric acid reactive analysis
  confirmed the hypothesis that O3 modified the membrane structure by incre=
asing
  the lipid peroxidation more in Caramba and Sentinel varieties. These
  alterations in the membranes reduced the ability to develop non-photochem=
ical
  quenching. The O3 effects on solute leakage and lipid peroxidation in the
  Othelo variety were lower than in the other two varieties, which allowed =
non
  -photochemical quenching to develop in this variety. These results sugges=

AB: From March to December 2001, an outbreak of yellow fever was observed i=
n
  Cote d'Ivoire. Sentinel surveillance for haemorrhagic fever allowed detec=
tion
  of the first case in the Duekoue health district in the heavily wooded we=
stern
  part of the country. A weekly reporting system was established. For each
  suspected case recorded and reported to the Epidemiological Surveillance
  Department at the National Institute of Public Hygiene, a sample was coll=
ected
  and sent for confirmation at the Pasteur Institute of the Cote d'Ivoire. =
The
  outbreak progressed from West to East reaching Abidjan, the economic capi=
tal of
  the country located in the southeast. The epidemic emergency plan consist=
ed of
  setting up a crisis committee to implement epidemiological, entomological=
 and
  virological surveillance, mass vaccination campaigns in areas around conf=
irmed
  cases, and vector control. A total of 280 cases were reported including 3=
2
  confirmed cases and 6 deaths. Eleven out of 62 districts were affected wi=
th
  most cases occurring in cities with more than 10000 inhabitants. Over 3.7
  million persons were vaccinated for an overall coverage of 92.2% in the a=
reas
  where campaigns were carried out. As a result of this outbreak, surveilla=
nce
  for potentially epidemic diseases has been reinforced and surveillance of=
 viral
  transmission is now being considered. A vaccination program for adults ha=
s also
  been established.

  several sporadic infections in laboratory rats have been described. Based=
 on
  molecular data, 3 E. cuniculi strains have been identified. We describe t=
he
  first in vitro propagation of E. cuniculi, which was isolated from a free
  ranging rat (Rattus norvegicus). The rat was one of three seropositive an=
imals
  among 23 rats captured in the city of Zurich, Switzerland. The new isolat=
e was
  further characterized as strain II ("mouse"-strain) based on the rDNA int=
ernal
  transcribed spacer sequence. Western blot analysis of this isolate reveal=
ed
  slight differences to other available strain II isolates originating from
  laboratory mice and farmed blue foxes. The new isolate caused disseminate=
d
  infection in liver and lung upon oral inoculation of Brown Norway (BN) ra=
ts and
  was transmitted to sentinel rats. This rat-adapted isolate will be valuab=
le to
  study the pathogenesis of Encephalitozoon infections in the rat model.

  parasites. Calves in the larvicidal trial were inoculated on Day 16 relat=
ive to
  treatment with _1000 embryonated Trichuris spp. eggs and _640 infective
  Oesophagostomum spp. larvae. Calves were allocated by lottery to one of t=

  treatment groups (n=3D8 per group), which included: Group I -- moxidectin=
 0.5%
  pour-on (0.5 mg/kg body weight) applied topically; Group II -- moxidectin=
 1%
  non-aqueous injectable (0.2 mg/kg) administered subcutaneously; Group III=

  untreated controls. Treatments were administered on Day 0 and calves were
  housed by group with no contact among animals of different treatments. Th=
ree
  sentinel calves were necropsied on Day 0 of the larvicidal trial to asses=
s the
  viability of larval inocula. On Days 14, 15 and 16 after treatment, calve=
s were
  euthanatized (two or three from each group per day) and samples of gut co=
ntents
  were collected to determine total worm counts. On Day 63 relative to trea=
tment,
  calves in the adulticidal efficacy trial were inoculated with _1000 embry=
onated
  Trichuris eggs and then on Day 35 with _2500 infective Oesophagostomum sp=

  groups (n=3D8 per group): Group IV -- moxidectin 0.5% pour-on; Group V --
  moxidectin 1% injectable; Group VI -- untreated controls. Details of
  experimental treatments, calf housing and necropsy scheduling were simila=
r to
  the larvicidal trial. In both the larvicidal and adulticidal trials, inoc=
ula
  contained a variety of parasites in addition to the targeted species. Bas=
ed on

AB: The distribution of the sylvatic subtype ID Venezuelan equine encephali=
tis
  (VEE) viruses in the lowland tropical forests of western Venezuela was
  investigated using remote sensing and geographic information system
  technologies. Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper satellite imagery was used to stu=
dy the
  reflectance patterns of VEE endemic foci and to identify other locations =
with
  similar reflectance patterns. Enzootic VEE virus variants isolated during=
 this
  study are the closest genetic relatives of the epizootic viruses that eme=
rged
  in western Venezuela during 1992-1993. VEE virus surveillance was conduct=
ed by
  exposing sentinel hamsters to mosquito bites and trapping wild vertebrate=
s in
  seven forests identified and located by means of the satellite image. We
  isolated VEE viruses from 48 of a total of 1363 sentinel hamsters in two =
of the
  forests on six occasions, in both dry and wet seasons. None of the 12 sma=
ll
  vertebrates captured in 8190 trap-nights showed signs of previous VEE vir=
us
  infection. The satellite image was classified into 13 validated classes o=
f land
  use/vegetation using unsupervised and supervised techniques. Data derived=
 from
  the image consisted of the raw digital values of near- and mid-infrared b=
ands
  4, 5 and 7, derived Tasseled Cap indices of wetness, greenness and bright=
ness,
  and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. Digitized maps provided
  ancillary data of elevation and soil geomorphology. Image enhancement was
  applied using Principal Component Analysis. A digital layer of roads toge=
ther
  with georeferenced images was used to locate the study sites. A cluster
  analysis using the above data revealed two main groups of dense forests
  separated by spectral properties, altitude and soil geomorphology. Virus =
was
  isolated more frequently from the forest type identified on flat flood pl=
ains
  of main rivers rather than the forest type found on the rolling hills of =
the
  study area. The spatial analysis suggests that mosquitoes carrying the en=
zootic
  viruses would reach 82-97% of the total land area by flying only 1-3 km f=
rom
  forests. We hypothesize that humans within that area are at risk of sever=
e
  disease caused by enzootic ID VEE viruses. By contrast, equines could act=
ually
  become naturally vaccinated, thus preventing the local emergence of epizo=
otic
  IC VEE virus strains and protecting humans indirectly.

AB: The introduction of a St Louis encephalitis virus (SLE) genotype new to
  southeastern California, USA, during 2000 was followed by focal enzootic
  amplification in the Coachella Valley that was detected by seroconversion=
s of
  29 sentinel chickens in 5 of 9 flocks of 10 chickens each, isolations of =
virus
  from 30 of 538 pools of 50 Culex tarsalis females, and collection of 30
  positive sera from 2205 wild birds. This SLE strain over wintered success=
fully
  and then amplified during the summer of 2001, with 47 sentinel seroconver=
sions
  in 8 of 9 flocks, 70 virus isolations from 719 pools of C. tarsalis and C=
.
  pipiens quinquefasciatus [C. quinquefasciatus] and 40 positive sera from =
847
  wild birds. Human illness was not detected by passive case surveillance,
  despite issuance of a health alert during 2001. Virus amplification durin=
g both
  years was associated with above average temperatures conducive for extrin=
sic
  incubation and below average precipitation during spring associated with =
below
  average vector abundance. Seroconversions by sentinel chickens provided t=
he
  timely detection of virus activity, with initial conversions detected bef=
ore
  positive mosquito pools or wild bird infections. Vertical infection was n=
ot
  detected among C. tarsalis adults reared from immatures collected during =
the
  fall-winter of 2000, even though SLE over wintered successfully in this a=
rea.
  Early seroconversions by a sentinel chicken during February 2001 and a
  recaptured Gambel's quail [Callipepla gambelii] in April 2001 provided ev=
idence
  for transmission during winter and spring when ambient temperatures avera=

AB: The cellular processes involved in metal metabolism in molluscs are
  reviewed, with emphasis on the contribution of microscopy (AMG, ARG, EPMA=
, and
  SIMS) to both basic research of metal cell biology and applied environmen=
tal
  research. In molluscs, metal uptake may occur by facilitated diffusion, a=
ctive
  transport, or endocytosis, and can be enhanced by MT synthesis or formati=
on of
  mineralized granules. In aquatic molluscs, gills constitute a key interfa=
ce for
  dissolved metal uptake, where metals are bound to MT, incorporated into
  lysosomes, and released basally towards the blood plasma and circulating
  hemocytes. However, particulate metal uptake is mainly achieved via the
  digestive tract by endocytosis; further metals are transferred first to
  lysosomes and then to residual bodies, especially in the digestive cells =
of the
  digestive gland. Additionally, metals can be accumulated selectively in
  specific cell types. As ligands pools differ from cell to cell, different
  metals may be retained in different cell types. Class "a" metals are loca=
lized
  in cells with granules composed of carbonate, oxalate, phosphate, and sul=
fate
  (oxygen donors), whereas "b" metals are associated with those cell types =
rich
  in sulfur and nitrogen ligands (sulfur donors). In molluscs, oxygen donor=
s
  occur in connective tissue calcium cells and basophilic cells, whereas su=
lfur
  donors are present in digestive cells, podocytes, nephrocytes, and rhogoc=
ytes.
  Hemocytes, which constitute the most relevant system for metal transport
  between tissues, move around the body and may penetrate tissues and remov=
e
  metals from the inner medium to be accumulated in lysosomes as nondigeste=
d
  products. Rhogocytes also participate in metal mobilization, accumulation=
, and
  release. The assessment of metal levels in target cells of sentinel mollu=
scs by
  microscopic techniques provides an early-warning measure, with promising
  applications as an exposure biomarker for environmental monitoring progra=
ms.

AB: The mutant genotype at codon 76 of the pfcrt gene (T76) has been propos=
ed as
  a molecular marker for surveillance of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant Plasmod=
ium
  falciparum malaria but this proposal has not been validated by population=
-based
  surveys. In 1998-99, in 6 Ugandan sentinel sites, the prevalence of P.
  falciparum infections with the T76 genotype and the level of CQ use were
  measured by community surveys, and CQ resistance was determined by in-viv=
o
  tests on 6-59-month-old children with clinical malaria. The prevalence of=
 T76
  was not related to the overall clinical (early and late treatment failure=
:
  ETF+LTF; r=3D0.14, P=3D0.78) or parasitological (RI+RII+RIII; r=3D0.17, P=
=3D0.73) CQ
  resistance. However, the percentage of individuals carrying only infectio=
ns
  with the T76 genotype (T76 alone) increased with increasing ETF (r=3D0.76=
,
  P=3D0.07) and type RIII parasitological failure (r=3D0.69, P=3D0.12). Sim=
ilarly, the
  ratio between T76 and K76 (the wild type) prevalences (T76/K76) was stron=
gly
  and positively correlated with ETF (r=3D0.85, P=3D0.03) and RIII (r=3D0.8=
2, P=3D0.04).
  Moreover, T76 alone (r=3D0.90, P=3D0.01) as well as T76/K76 (r=3D0.90, P=
=3D0.01)
  significantly increased with increasing community CQ use. T76 alone and T=
76/K76
  can be useful markers to estimate the ETF and RIII prevalence as well as =
the
  amount of CQ use in the community.

PY: 2002
LA: English
AB: The elimination of seropositive dogs in Brazil has been used to control
  zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis but with little success. To elucidate the
  reasons for this, the infectiousness of 50 sentinel dogs exposed to natur=
al
  Leishmania chagasi [Leishmania infantum chagasi] infection was assessed t=
hrough
  time by xenodiagnosis with the sandfly vector, Lutzomyia longipalpis. Eig=
hteen
  (43%) of 42 infected dogs became infectious after a median of 333 days in=
 the
  field (105 days after seroconversion). Seven highly infectious dogs (17%)
  accounted for > 80% of sandfly infections. There were positive correlatio=
ns
  between infectiousness and anti-Leishmania immunoglobulin G, parasite det=
ection
  by polymerase chain reaction, and clinical disease (logistic regression,
  r2=3D0.08-0.18). The sensitivity of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to =
detect
  currently infectious dogs was high (96%) but lower in the latent period (=
 <
  630%), and specificity was low (24%). Mathematical modelling suggests tha=
t
  culling programs fail because of high incidence of infection and
  infectiousness, the insensitivity of the diagnostic test to detect infect=
ious
  dogs, and time delays between diagnosis and culling.

  followed by a club (8.9%, 11.7%) and free-lancing (8.6%, 9.0%). The propo=

  of FSWs who always used condoms in vaginal sex with commercial sex partne=
rs was
  70.9% and 75.0%, respectively (P=3D0.038). Compared with previous results=
, a
  rising trend of condom use by FSWs in commercial sex was observed. Howeve=
r,
  there was a relatively low condom use during commercial oral sexual inter=
course
  (30.7%, 36.6%) and sex with their regular sex partners in all forms of se=
xual
  activities. Client dislike is the main attributed factor for not wearing
  condoms. The point prevalence of both infectious syphilis and HIV infecti=
on was
  0.1% in both years. These data are useful for planning, resource allocati=
on and
  evaluation of outreach activities and STI services targeting at FSWs and =
their
  clients. They provide a sampling framework for further surveillance.

AB: Travellers have the potential both to acquire and to spread dengue viru=
s
  infection. The incidence of dengue fever (DF) among European travellers
  certainly is underestimated, because few centres use standardized diagnos=
tic
  procedures for febrile patients. In addition, DF is currently not reporte=
d in
  most European public health systems. Surveillance has commenced within th=
e
  framework of a European Network on Imported Infectious Disease Surveillan=
ce
  (TropNetEurop) to gain information on the quantity and severity of cases =
of
  dengue imported into Europe. Descriptions of 294 patients from Europe wit=
h DF
  during January 1999-December 2001 were analysed for epidemiological infor=
mation
  and clinical features. By far the most infections were imported from Asia=
,
  which suggests a high risk of DF for travellers to that region. Dengue
  haemorrhagic fever occurred in 7 patients (2.4%) all of whom recovered. D=
ata
  reported by member sites of the TropNetEurop can contribute to understand=
ing
  the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of imported DF.

AB: In order to isolate enzootic/endemic Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VE=
E)
  and to establish a correlation between epizootic/epidemic viruses acting =
during
  1992-1995 and the enzootic/endemic strains isolated from ecological niche=
s, an
  investigation was made in the parish of Jesus Maria Semprum (JMS), Catatu=
mbo
  municipality of Zulia State, Venezuela. Methodology was based on the expo=
sition
  of sentinel hamsters, isolation and identification of viruses in sick ani=
mals,
  collection, classification and viral isolations from mosquitoes, and capt=
ure
  and bleeding of small rodents. Techniques used for the identification of
  isolated viral strains were complement fixation and indirect
  immunofluorescence, as well as reverse Polymerase-Transcriptase chain rea=
ction
  technique (PCR-RT), and sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. The results=
 of
  this investigation provided three isolations of VEE viruses identified as=
 ID in
  the locality of Rio Claro and Las Nubes of JMS parish during the month of
  February 1997, indicating that the enzootic/endemic transmission of the E=
EV
  viruses variety ID is still active in Catatumbo in spite of the significa=
nt
  ecological changes produced in the tropical forests. However, a correlati=
on
  exists between the strains of VEE viruses isolated during the 1992 outbre=
ak and
  the ones isolated in 1997 in the same region, suggesting that more endemi=
c VEE
  virus isolations are required in order to establish correlation between t=

  endemic and epidemic strains of VEE and to recognize the possible common
  ancestors of the epidemic strains.

  antlers of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) killed between 1951 and 1999 in=

  110 and 8178 mg F-/kg ash, and there was an overall marked decrease over =
the
  sampling period. Average bone fluoride concentrations in antlers from the
  periods 1980 through 1989 (geometric mean, 95% confidence interval: 1490,=
 range
  of 1193-1861 mg/kg ash) and 1990 through 1999 (753, range of 644-882 mg/k=
g ash)
  differed significantly (P < 0.001) and were both significantly lower (P <
  0.001) than those from the periods 1951 through 1969 (3720, range 3227-42=
88
  mg/kg ash) and 1970 through 1979 (2573, range 2203-3006 mg/kg ash). These
  findings are indicative of progressively reduced atmospheric fluoride
  deposition into the study area, caused by effective emission-control meas=
ures
  in Germany and neighbuoring countries. Because antlers are replaced annua=
lly,
  grow during a fixed period of some months, and are regularly collected an=
d kept
  as trophies, these are well suited as monitoring units for analysing temp=
oral
  trends in environmental pollution by fluoride and other bone-seeking poll=

nged
  from 43% in M. raptorellus to 76% in N. vitripennis. Parasitoid emergence=

AB: Ideally, a phytosanitary performance standard would be defined as a
  probabilistic tolerance. For treatments such as solid wood pasteurization=
, this
  could be operationalized by stating with a specific degree of confidence =
that
  the treatment failure rate for a sentinel pest should be less than a defi=
ned
  level (e.g., X% confidence that the wood heat treatment failure rate for =
pest Y
  does not exceed Z%). This article illustrates a probabilistic approach to
  developing a phytosanitary performance standard, using heat treatment of =
the
  wood-inhabiting fungus Postia placenta as an example. The uncertainty abo=
ut the
  proportion of wood blocks in which P. placenta survives after treatment i=
s
  characterized by the Beta distribution, subject to the biological constra=
int
  that survival should decrease monotonically with increased time and
  temperature. Monte Carlo simulation techniques are then used to generate =
a
  probabilistic response surface relating proportion survival to treatment =
time
  and temperature. This modelling approach relaxes the parametric assumptio=
ns
  associated with traditional statistical methods for fitting response surf=
aces
  and is more flexible than conventional methods, resulting in a better fit=
 to
  the observed data.

AB: Background: The objective of this descriptive study is to investigate t=
he
  incidence of type 2 diabetes in sentinel general practices in three regio=
ns in
  Belgium and to describe the patient characteristics and the start of the
  medical management after diagnosis. Methods: For two successive years (19=
97-98)
  all patients who were newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes were registere=
d. Two
  weeks after inclusion, the registering physician completed an extensive
  questionnaire. This questionnaire dealt with risk factors, biochemical
  parameters, existing complications and treatment. Results: According to t=
his
  study, the yearly incidence of type 2 diabetes in Belgium was 231 per 100=
000
  inhabitants. Though the biochemical parameters (BMI, HbA1c, serum cholest=
erol
  and triglycerides) did not differ in the three regions of the country bei=
ng
  investigated, there were considerable differences in the treatment prescr=
ibed
  for diabetes and its co-morbidity. In Flanders, treatment was usually sta=
rted
  with sulfonylurea, in the Walloon provinces with biguanides. Hypolipaemic
  treatment was also started more frequently in the latter region. In Fland=
ers,
  hypertension was registered in 51.4% of the newly diagnosed patients with
  diabetes, which was higher than in the other regions. However, no differe=
nce
  was noted between the different regions in the number of patients with di=
abetes
  who are treated for hypertension. Conclusion: A network of sentinel physi=
cians,
  taking part in voluntary registration, can be helpful in calculating the
  incidence of a health problem, in particular type 2 diabetes in general
  practice. The sentinel net can also serve as an instrument for describing
  patient characteristics and showing how physicians deal with health probl=
ems.
  The regional differences in medical approach that are described require f=
urther
  investigation, mainly with respect to their impact on the patients' outco=
me.

AB: A virus isolated from one of the blood samples collected from sentinel
  cattle in late summer of 1999, at Omura (32.59 N, 129.58 E), in Nagasaki
  Prefecture (Japan) was identified by the cross-neutralization test as the
  Peaton virus, which belongs to genus Bunyavirus of the family Bunyavirida=
e.
  This virus was first isolated in Australia in 1976. The nucleotide identi=
ty of
  the nucleocapsid protein encoded by the S segment in the present virus di=
ffered
  by 8.9% from that of the Australian virus. But the amino acids of both vi=
ruses
  were nearly (98.7%) identical. A serological survey of the sentinel cattl=
e
  showed that the virus spread during late summer (between August and Novem=
ber).
  Seroconversion to the virus was reached in 38.0% of the cattle in Novembe=
r
  1999. Retrospective surveillance data indicated that the epidemic of the =
virus
  occurred intermittently for several years (1985, 1987, and 1995) during t=
he
  last 15 years.

AB: 1. In order to realize the full potential of natural enemies in integra=

  pest management, it is necessary to understand their population dynamics,
  particularly in relation to the role of refuges. Harvested and unharveste=
d
  plots were established in a commercial hay lucerne Medicago sativa crop a=
nd the
  potential for the unharvested vegetation to constitute a refuge for natur=
al
  enemies of Helicoverpa spp., one of the key pests, was evaluated. 2. The
  temporal and spatial dynamics of arthropod populations were evaluated usi=
ng
  sequential samples from directional traps (pitfall and Malaise) and vacuu=
m
  sampling in both crop treatments. 3. The spatial dynamics of predation we=
re
  measured using 'sentinel' cards baited with Helicoverpa spp. eggs. 4. The=
re was
  no significant directional movement of arthropods captured in pitfall tra=
ps,
  except for a 3-day period immediately after harvest when there was a net
  movement of the natural enemies Dicranolaius bellulus, Carabidae adults,
  spiders and the phytophagous mite Halotydeus destructor from harvested to
  unharvested plots. 5. There was net movement of adult Netelia producta, D=
.
  bellulus, Coccinella transversalis and Syrphidae as well as the pest
  Helicoverpa spp. from harvested to unharvested plots for 24 h following a
  harvest. 6. Densities of D. bellulus and C. transversalis within unharves=
ted
  plots decreased with increasing distance from the borders with harvested =
plots.
  7. Predation rates of Helicoverpa eggs placed in unharvested plots were b=
roadly
  consistent with predator densities and decreased with distance from the
  harvested plots. 8. Predation rates of Helicoverpa eggs placed in harvest=
ed
  plots declined with increasing distance from unharvested plots, suggestin=
g that
  natural enemies from the latter dispersed into regrowing lucerne. 9. Stri=
ps
  narrower than the plot width used (30 m) may be adequate to accommodate n=
atural
  enemies displaced by harvesting. Unharvested refuge strips should ideally=
 be
  spaced less than 30 m apart so that the natural enemies can contribute to
  biological control of pests over the entire width of harvested strips.

AB: This study aimed to use a standard questionnaire to obtain a nationally
  representative sample of opinions on a range of potential food risks.
  Participants were a national sample of 1182 subjects selected using three
  different approaches: random and sentinel postal samples and a telephone
  survey. The sites selected were Glasgow and Inverness in Scotland, Nottin=
gham
  and Lincoln in England, Cardiff and Llandudno in Wales and postal area SE=
19 in
  London. A modified psychometric questionnaire (the Perceived Food Risk In=
dex)
  was administered to subjects on three occasions, spanning five time-point=
s.
  Baseline data collection was undertaken from October to December 1998 (ph=
ase
  1). The second wave of data collection was undertaken over three time-poi=
nts in
  February, April and July 1999 (one-third of respondents to phase 1 at eac=
h time
  -point -- data combined as phase 2), and the final phase of data collecti=
on was
  between October and December 1999 (phase 3). Principal components analysi=
s was
  used to assess the intercorrelations between the items on the questionnai=
re.
  Two main components were identified as 'dread' and 'knowledge'. Saturated=
 fats
  were perceived as the least dreaded and the most known of the potential r=
isks
  considered, while bovine spongiform encephalopathy and Salmonella were th=
e
  risks dreaded the most. There was a slight perception that the potential =
risks
  had become more known over the year, especially for growth hormones. This=
 study
  has raised a number of important issues for risk communicators. Despite c=
urrent
  policy aimed at reducing fat intake, this will be difficult to achieve at=
 a
  population level since people are not worried about its impact, yet food =
safety
  continues to be a significant concern to the public.

reas for
  70 to 100 days, bred in an off-site finishing facility, and farrowed in a

once
  by ELISA. Two to five negative batches were grouped in off-site grower
  facilities, and tested again. Negative groups moved to a quarantine facil=

  Negative quarantine groups were used for stocking the PRRSV-negative herd=
. Of

 pigs
  were selected to stock the PRRSV-negative herd. A PRRSV-negative populati=

AB: This study was conducted to determine how long porcine reproductive and
  respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV)-infected pigs remain contagious to age
  -matched sentinel pigs and whether the infected pigs are intermittently o=
r
  continuously contagious. In each of 2 trials, five 4- to 6-week-old pigs
  (Principals) housed in one isolation room were inoculated with PRRSV. Pai=
rs of
  age-matched sentinel pigs (Sentinels) were sequentially placed in direct
  contact with the Principals for 2-week periods, with one week intervals b=
etween
  pairs. Serum samples collected from Sentinels were tested by virus isolat=
ion
  and serology (ELISA) to determine whether transmission had occurred. Eigh=
t
  pairs of Sentinels were rotated through the Principals' rooms over a 165-=
 or
  167-day period. The Principals were contagious through day 62, but not af=
ter
  day 69 in the first trial, and through day 60, but not after day 67 in th=
e
  second trial. This study demonstrated that seropositive, non-viraemic, gr=
ower
  -aged pigs may be the source of spread of PRRSV in growing-finishing unit=
s. The
  results also suggest that infected grower-aged pigs used as a source of P=
RRSV
  for natural infection of gilts of similar age in young-gilt acclimation
  programmes may only be relied upon to transmit PRRSV for a maximum of 60 =
days.

  label recommendations. Eight dogs and four cats served as untreated senti=
nels.
  Treatments were administered on days 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120. Each animal
  received an application of 100 fleas on days -28 and -21 and then weekly
  applications of 20 fleas from days 91 through 147. Flea comb counts were
  performed on day -6 and every 2 weeks after day 0. From day 29 (dogs) or =

AB: This paper presents the results of the follow-up of 3 sentinel herds be=
tween
  1994 and 2000 during an East Coast fever (ECF) epidemic in eastern Zambia=
. The
  animals of the sentinel herds were closely monitored clinically and
  serologically together with detailed Rhipicephalus appendiculatus counts.=
 Peaks
  of disease incidence occurred in the rainy season (December-February) and=
 the
  dry months of May-July with nymph-to-adult tick transmission dominating t=
he
  infection dynamics. A second wave of adult R. appendiculatus at the start=
 of
  the dry season is essential for the occurrence of a full-blown epidemic w=
hile
  the size of the susceptible cattle population acts as a most important li=
miting
  factor. The majority of adult cattle of the sentinel herds became infecte=
d less
  than 2 years after the introduction of the disease. The median age at fir=
st
  contact for calves born towards the end of the study (1999) was about 6 m=
onths.
  The case-fatality ratio (including sub-clinical cases) was estimated at 6=
0%. It
  is argued that part of the so-called 'natural mortality' is actually due =
to ECF
  and that ECF occurrence and mortality are systematically underestimated. =
The
  direct financial cost of the epidemic, based on loss of animals and cost =
of
  treatment only and calculated over 4 years running, was estimated at abou=
t
  US$6/year per animal at risk. The value of the traditional seroprevalence
  survey as a tool for monitoring ECF epidemiology is put in question and t=
he
  prevalence of maternal antibodies in new-born calves, reflecting the immu=
ne
  status of the dam population, is introduced as an alternative. It is
  demonstrated that an efficient immunization campaign should concentrate i=
ts
  efforts in the period of low adult R. appendiculatus abundance (July-Octo=
ber).

AB: Acute effects of the endocrine disruptor bis(tri-n-butyltin) oxide (TBT=
O) on
  moulting-hormone biosynthesis and imaginal disc development were investig=
ated
  in larvae of the midge C. riparius. Ecdysteroid synthesis was measured by=
 24-h
  incubation of moulting-hormone-synthesizing tissues (prothoracic glands) =
in
  vitro with or without the addition of TBTO. The amount of ecdysteroids pr=
oduced
  was analysed by radioimmunoassay. Developmental effects in vivo were
  investigated by determining the developmental phase of the genital imagin=
al
  discs before and after a 48-h exposure to TBTO in water. Sex-specific eff=
ects
  were found with both endpoints. Ecdysteroid synthesis was significantly r=
educed
  (analysis of variance (ANOVA), p_0.005) in female larvae at all concentra=
tions
  (TBTO-Sn at 50, 500 and 5000 ng/litre), whereas a significant elevation o=
f the
  biosynthesis rate occurred in male larvae in the 500-ng/litre treatment (=
ANOVA,
  p_0.05). In vivo experiments with development of the genital imaginal dis=
c
  within a 48-h exposure period revealed a significantly slower development=
 in
  female larvae and a significantly faster development in male larvae
  (contingency tables, p_0.001) at all concentrations tested (TBTO-Sn at 10=
, 50,
  200 and 1000 ng/litre). These results partly coincided with the in vitro
  effects on moulting-hormone synthesis. The 48-h median lethal concentrati=
on
  (LC50) was 25 =B5g/litre (20-30 =B5g/litre 95% confidence intervals). The
  combination of in vitro and in vivo methods has proven to be a useful app=
roach
  for the detection of endocrine effects of TBTO in C. riparius at levels 2=
000
  -fold below the LC50 value. High sensitivity and short test duration sugg=
est
  that chironomids may have potential as freshwater sentinel organisms for
  endocrine-disrupting chemicals.

AB: This study evaluated the protection against mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)
  afforded by static filter-top caging when automatic watering was used wit=
h
  conventional husbandry techniques as a labour-saving option. We fitted on=
e side
  of a double-sided 72-cage rack with valves external to each cage. Cages o=
n the
  other side were fitted with shielded internal valves. More than 50% of th=
e mice
  were breeding mice, and 30% were genetically altered. One cage of mice on=
 each
  shelf on both sides of the rack was infected with MHV-A59. Each row of ca=
ges
  also contained one standard cage (no filter top) of uninoculated mice at
  various distances from the infected cage. At 2, 4, and 6 weeks after infe=
ction
  of the mice in the test cages, uninoculated mice in 22 cages were tested =
by
  serology, and at 8 weeks the uninoculated mice in 54 cages were tested by
  serology and those in 24 cages were tested by polymerase chain reaction (=
PCR)
  amplification of faecal samples to assess transmission of infection. At 8=
 weeks
  post-infection, mice in one uninoculated cage (which had a filter top and=
 an
  internal valve and was adjacent to a cage of inoculated mice) was seropos=
itive.
  Examination of faeces by PCR revealed MHV shedding in mice in 9 uninocula=
ted
  cages (3 lacking filter tops but with internal valve cages; 2 with filter=
 tops
  and internal valve cages and adjacent to non-filter top cages; 2 non-filt=
er-top
  cages with external valves; and 2 filter-top cages with external valves, =
of
  which one was adjacent to a non-filter-top cage). Routine husbandry using
  either automatic water valve system prevented (with one exception) transm=
ission
  among filter-top cages for at least 6 weeks. The 10 cages where transmiss=
ion
  occurred were non-filter-top cages (n=3D5) and filter-top cages adjacent =
to non
  -filter top, infected, or sentinel cages (n=3D5). Results suggest that th=
e use of
  filter top-caging with automatic watering may limit MHV transmission for =
6
  weeks, during which immunocompetent mice would be expected to clear the v=
irus.
  Our findings also suggest that long-term use of automatic watering in sta=
tic
  filter-top cages handled using conventional husbandry techniques may not
  prevent transmission in the vicinity of high virus concentrations or open
  caging.

AB: In search for the cause of experimental variations in respiratory resea=

  data, serology revealed the prevalence of antibodies against parainfluenz=
a
  virus type 3 (PIV 3) in guineapigs. The aim of the present study was to e=
xplore
  the transmission rate, course, and kinetics of enzootic PIV 3 infection i=
n
  guineapig breeding units. In the first part of the study, blood samples t=
o be
  analysed for PIV 3 antibodies were collected from guineapigs of a PIV 3
  -positive breeding colony at different times after birth. In the same bre=
eding
  unit, 6 of 12 two-week-old guineapigs were relocated and separately house=
d. The
  PIV 3 serum antibody titres of the 2 groups were compared at various time=
s from
  birth to 13 weeks after birth. In the second part of the study, the sprea=
d of
  infectious virus and virus persistence were explored by housing seronegat=
ive
  sentinel animals together with 2- to 3-week-old guineapigs from 3 differe=
nt PIV
  3-positive breeding units. The guineapigs remaining in the breeding colon=
y as
  well as those removed and housed separately showed declining serum antibo=
dy
  titres for about one month after birth, thereafter the titres were stable=
 until
  about 8 weeks after birth. Five weeks later, the mean antibody titre of t=
he
  guineapigs remaining in the breeding colony had increased to a markedly h=
igher
  level than that of the relocated, separately housed guineapigs. Seroconve=
rsion
  was demonstrated in 7 of the 14 sentinels housed with the 2- to 3-week-ol=
d
  guineapigs from PIV 3-positive breeding units. Sentinels housed together =
with
  PIV 3-positive guineapigs 24 weeks after the start of the experiment did =
not
  seroconvert. It is concluded that young guineapigs born to PIV 3-positive
  mothers are protected by maternal immunity against infection with PIV 3 d=
uring
  their first 14 days of life. The guineapig offspring became infected duri=
ng the
  period from about 2 weeks until 8 weeks after birth, as demonstrated by
  seroconversion of sentinel animals and an increasing mean antibody titre =
seen
  beyond 8 weeks of age. The study did not reveal any indication of virus
  persistence or prolonged carrier status.

AB: North Florida is a transition zone between widespread Culex nigripalpus
  populations to the south and focal Culex salinarius populations to the no=
rth.
  Culex nigripalpus is a vector of St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) and eastern
  equine encephalitis (EEE) viruses in south Florida, while C. salinarius i=
s a
  suspected New World vector of West Nile (WN) virus. Abundant vector popul=
ations
  are often a prerequisite for epidemic and epizootic transmission of
  arboviruses. Extensive SLE transmission has never been reported from nort=
h
  Florida, but sporadic WN transmission was reported there during the summe=
r of
  2001. The disparate flavivirus transmission patterns observed in north an=
d
  south Florida may be due, in part, to the local geographical and seasonal
  distribution of Culex vectors. Here we report that between May 1991 and A=
pril
  1994, C. salinarius was most commonly observed during the winter and spri=
ng in
  northeast Florida (Duval County), whereas C. nigripalpus was most abundan=
t
  during the summer and autumn. An unusually mild spring in 1991 allowed C.
  nigripalpus to reproduce early in the year, resulting in a summer populat=
ion
  that emerged more than 8 weeks earlier than in 1992 and 1993. The 1991 C.
  nigripalpus population persisted through October, when SLE transmission w=
as
  detected by sentinel chickens. Transmission of SLE was not detected in Du=
val
  County in 1992 or 1993. These data indicate that mild winter and spring
  conditions in north Florida may favour increased abundance and survival o=
f C.
  nigripalpus in a region where this species is normally not abundant. A se=
asonal
  shift in population structure may increase the transmission risk of arbov=
iruses
  for which C. nigripalpus is a competent vector, including SLE, WN, and EE=
E.

AB: The interaction between soil types, temperature, and soil water potenti=
al
  may have differential effects on the survival of Cryptosporidium parvum o=
ocysts
  in the terrestrial environment. We examined the effects of three soil typ=
es (a
  silty clay loam, silt loam, and loamy sand), three temperatures (4, 20, a=
nd
  30=B0C), and three soil water potentials (-0.033, -0.5 and -1.5 MPa) on t=
he
  inactivation kinetics of oocysts. Sentinel chambers were filled with air-=
dried
  and sieved soil, brought to the appropriate soil water potential, and
  inoculated with 2 x 106 freshly purified oocysts. The inoculated chambers=
 were
  buried in the same bulk soil at the appropriate water potentials and incu=
bated
  at one of the three temperatures. Triplicate chambers were removed from t=
he
  bulk soil on days 0, 22, 43, 84 and 156. Sentinel oocysts were extracted,=
 and
  assayed for potential infectivity by the dye permeability method. Oocysts
  suspended in sterile distilled water and incubated with the sentinel cham=
bers
  were used as controls for the effect of temperature. The soil water poten=
tials
  investigated did not affect oocyst inactivation at any temperature or wit=
h any
  of the three soil types. Rates of oocyst inactivation increased significa=
ntly
  between 4 and 20=B0C, but not between 20 and 30=B0C with the exception of=
 oocysts
  incubated in the silty clay loam. Oocyst survival appeared to be signific=
antly
  greater in the silt loam soil than in the two other soil types when incub=
ated
  at 20=B0C; and at 30=B0C oocyst survival was significantly less in the si=
lt clay
  loam than in the other two soil types. Rates of sentinel oocyst inactivat=
ion at
  all three soil water potentials were significantly lower than the control
  oocysts in water at the three test temperatures. Thus, oocyst survival in=
 soil
  was not affected by the water potentials between-0.033 and-1.5 MPa; it wa=
s
  affected by soil texture; but temperature appeared to be the factor most
  affecting oocyst survival. In the critical ambient range of temperature i=
n
  temperate climates oocysts may survive for months in agricultural soil, a=
nd
  pose a threat to surface waters.

  marker vaccine "Porcilis(R) Pesti" have been studied using the following
  different vaccination schedules: Group A -- two vaccinations with an inte=
rval
  of 28 d, challenge 14 d after second vaccination (p.v2.); group B -- two
  vaccinations with an interval of 14 d, challenge 14 d later; group C -- t=

  vaccinations with an interval of 28 d, challenge at time of booster
  vaccination; group D -- two vaccinations with an interval of 14 d, challe=
nge 7
  d p.v2.; group E -- single vaccination and infection 14 d later. After
  infection one sentinel pig was added to the vaccinated and infected pigs =
of
  each group. A single vaccination did not induce protective immunity again=
st a
  CSFV challenge. Double vaccination at a four-week interval protected pigl=
ets
  from clinical infection, and neither viraemia and leukopenia nor virus
  excretion were detected if infected 14 d p.v2. Two vaccinations at a two-=
week
  interval followed by a challenge 7 d p.v2. led to a short viraemia on day=
 5
  p.i. but without excretion of CSFV. Though all other vaccination schedule=
s
  induced a reduction in virus shedding and a decrease in CSFV replication,=
 in
  all these cases in-contact controls became infected. The results of
  transmission of CSFV are discussed in relation to a potential use of subu=
nit
  marker vaccines in CSF control.

AB: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is an RNA v=
irus
  in the order Nidovirales, family Arteriviridae, genus Arterivirus. The vi=
rus
  induces a prolonged viraemia, replicates in macrophages, and produces
  persistent infection. The purpose of this study was to determine if PRRSV=
 could
  persist for 90 d or more in a large population of breeding-age gilts hous=
ed
  under environmental conditions typical of commercial swine production and=
 to
  determine if experimentally infected gilts could shed virus to naive sent=
inel
  gilts beyond 90 d postinfection. Using the intranasal route, 120 PRRSV-na=
ive
  gilts, 4 months of age, were inoculated with 5 ml of cell culture fluid
  containing a total dose of 102.4 TCID50 of a field isolate (MN-30100) of =
PRRSV.
  The index gilts were organized into 3 groups (A, B, and C), 40 gilts per =
group.
  To assess the dynamics of the experimental infection, a monitor group of =
30
  index gilts was blood-tested on days 0, 3, 7, 14, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, a=
nd 180
  postinfection. PRRSV viraemia was detected with the polymerase chain reac=
tion
  (PCR) on days 3, 7, and 14 and by virus isolation (VI) on days 7 and 14. =
PRRSV
  antibodies were detected from day 14 by ELISA. To assess shedding, 30 PRR=
SV
  -naive sentinel gilts were commingled with the index gilts on day 90
  postinfection and tested by PCR, VI, and ELISA every 15 d until 180 d
  postinfection; all samples were negative. To assess persistence, 40 index=
 and
  10 sentinel gilts were slaughtered at 120 (group A), 150 (group B), or 18=
0
  (group C) d postinfection. Evidence of PRRSV was not detected by PCR or V=
I in
  any tissue samples from the 120 index gilts. These results indicate that
  persistence and shedding of PRRSV are of short duration in breeding-age g=
ilts.

  in Arkansas (1999), and on A. quadrimaculatus in 2 types of commercial ri=

  fields in Mississippi (1999 and 2000), at various times after treatment. =
In

t
  sentinel 3rd stage larvae of P. columbiae installed in 0.42-ha rice plots=
 48 h
  after treatment provided no control at 72 and 96 h after treatment. In a =
later
  test, VectoLex WDG manually applied at 5.04 and 1.68 kg/ha to small rice =
plots
  containing sentinel 3rd stage larvae of P. columbiae and A. quadrimaculat=
us
  obtained 90 and 97% control of P. columbiae, respectively, 24 h after
  treatment. A 2nd installation of P. columbiae at 24 h after treatment res=
ulted
  in 7 and 0% control, respectively. Poor control was obtained at both rate=
s
  against A. quadrimaculatus 24 and 48 h after treatment for both installat=
ions.
  In the 1999 Cleveland test, VectoLex WDG aerially applied at 1.68 and 0.5=
6
  kg/ha to 0.2-ha plots in a contoured rice field produced 81 and 85% reduc=
tions
  in early larvae and 94 and 76% reductions in late larvae of A. quadrimacu=
latus
  2 days after treatment, respectively. In 2000, VectoLex WDG applied at 1.=
68
  kg/ha to two 0.40-ha plots in a precision-leveled field yielded 59 and 10=
0%
  reductions of early and late larvae, respectively, 2 days after treatment=
.
  Reduction of late larvae remained 100% at 8 days after treatment. It is
  suggested that the differences in susceptibility of P. columbiae and A.
  quadrimaculatus to VectoLex WDG could be attributed to species difference=
s in
  larval feeding behaviour, body positioning in the water column and
  developmental time.

AB: Aims: To (1) describe the South African Community Epidemiology Network =
on
  Drug Use (SACENDU), (2) describe trends and associated consequences of al=
cohol
  and other drug (AOD) use in South Africa for January 1997 to December 199=
9 and
  (3) outline selected policy implications identified by SACENDU participan=
ts.
  Methods: A descriptive epidemiological study of AOD indicators based on d=
ata
  gathered from multiple sources, including specialist treatment centres, t=
rauma
  units and quantitative studies of target groups such as school students a=
nd
  arrestees. Networks were established in five sentinel sites to facilitate=
 the
  collection, interpretation and dissemination of data. Results: Over time
  alcohol has been the most frequently reported primary substance of abuse =
across
  sites. Trauma and psychiatric data highlight the burden associated with a=
lcohol
  abuse. Cannabis and Mandrax (methaqualone), alone or in combination, are =
the
  most frequently reported illicit drugs of abuse, generally comprising the
  largest proportions of drug-related arrests, drug-related psychiatric dia=
gnoses
  and drug-positive trauma patients. From 1997 to 1999, a significant incre=
ase in
  indicators for cocaine/crack and heroin occurred in two sites. Ecstasy (M=
DMA)
  use, alone or in combination with other substances, is reported among you=
ng
  people. Conclusions: A broad range of globally abused substances is prese=
nt in
  South Africa and the use and burden of illicit substances appears to be
  increasing. This points to the importance of ongoing monitoring of AOD tr=

AB: From 1995 to 2001, five rounds of sentinel surveillance were carried ou=
t for
  young women attending antenatal care clinics at four health centres in Ad=
dis
  Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia, to monitor trends in the prevalence =
of HIV
  infection and syphilis. Serum samples were tested for antibodies to HIV (=
enzyme
  -linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting) and antibodies to Trepo=
nema
  pallidum (T. pallidum haemagglutination assay and rapid plasma reagin tes=
t).
  Prevalence ratios for an increase in one calendar year were estimated usi=
ng log
  -binomial models. Between 1995 and 2001, the prevalence of HIV infection =
among
  young women (age range, 15-24 years) attending antenatal care clinics in =
inner
  city health centres declined from 24.2% to 15.1% (prevalence ratio for an
  increase in one calendar year, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.87-0.95).=
 No
  change was observed for older age groups or in outer city health centres.=
 The
  decline in the prevalence of active syphilis (T. pallidum haemagglutinati=
on
  assay and rapid plasma reagin testing positive for antibodies to T. palli=
dum)
  was more pronounced among and also restricted to the young age groups (ag=

  range, 15-24 years) in the inner city (from 7.6% in 1995 to 1.3% in 2001;
  prevalence ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.59-0.80). The declinin=
g
  trends in the prevalence of HIV infection and syphilis among young women
  attending antenatal care clinics in the inner city are encouraging, but t=

AB: The purpose of the present study was to determine the prevalence of
  antibiotic resistance, with special attention to vancomycin, in 104 strai=
ns of
  Enterococcus, which is the sentinel bacterium isolated from dog (n=3D85) =
and cat
  (n=3D19) faeces samples obtained from north eastern Portugal [date not gi=
ven].
  The phenotypic characterization of the isolates classified them as E. fae=
cium
  (58%), E. avium (41%) and E. faecalis (1%). Sensitivity testing used the
  diffusion method according to the recommendations of CASFM (Comite de
  l'Antibiogramme de la Societe Francaise de Microbiogie), to oxacillin,
  amoxicillin, amoxicillin+clavulanic acid, ampicillin, piperacillin,
  cefoperazone, imipenem, enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, nalidixic=
 acid,
  tetracycline, lincomycin, erythromycin and vancomycin. Minimum inhibitory
  concentration (MIC) determination by E test revealed a MIC to vancomycin =
of
  between 0.5 =B5g/ml and 3 =B5g/ml. All the strains were resistant to nali=
dixic
  acid, erythromycin, cefoperazone and oxacillin. We detected resistance to
  amoxicillin+clavulanic acid in 1.9% of isolates, to amoxicillin in 4.8%, =
to
  piperacillin in 13.5%, and to ampicillin in 21.2% of strains. A high prev=
alence
  of antibiotic resistance to lincomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin,
  ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin was found in 98.1, 95.2, 76.9, 73.1 and 64.4%=
 of
  strains, respectively. Resistance to vancomycin was not found, which indi=
cates
  that there is no transmission risk of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal s=
trains
  to man or transfer of their resistance genes to other bacteria belonging =
to the
  endogenous flora of humans.

  and extensive cleaning and disinfection of the animal facilities was appl=
ied
  with the aim of limiting PRRSV the infection pressure within the herd. In=
 the
  period from 24 December 2000 to 8 January 2001, inseminations of sows wer=
e
  stopped. Beginning from 24 February, all piglets after weaning (at the ag=
e of
  21 days) were moved to distant farm facilities. The herd was constantly
  serologically monitored and production results were analysed until Octobe=
r
  2001. After 30 months the production results of the herd returned to the =
level
  before the PRRS outbreak. The serological results showed that all sows
  seroconverted. To check whether any of the animals of the herd were shedd=
ing
  PRRSV, on 30 August 2001 ten sentinel gilts unexposed to PRRSV were intro=
duced
  and allowed to move freely within all groups. Results of serum examinatio=
n of
  the sentinels after two months did not show any signs of their seroconver=
sion.
  However, after 45 days all of the sentinels seroconverted. This experimen=
t
  demonstrated that SEW and significant depopulation of fattening units is =
a good
  PRRS control method that is able to return production results back to nor=
mal
  after one year from the beginning of the outbreak. It should be stressed =
that
  this method is not able to eliminate the infectious virus from the herd d=
uring
  this time.

  for evaluating potential phytotoxicity to rooted aquatic macrophytes in a=
quatic
  systems. To further evaluate the potential utility of this species, T.
  latifolia seed germination, shoot growth, and root elongation were measur=
ed in
  7-day aqueous exposures using mean measured aqueous copper concentrations=
 of
  10.0, 23, 41, 62, 174, and 402 =B5g Cu/litre, which were _62% of nominal
  concentrations. Seed germination and seedling shoot growth were not
  significantly affected by any of these copper concentrations as compared =
to
  controls. Mean measured no-observed-effect-concentration (NOEC) and lowes=
t
  -observed-effect-concentration (LOEC) for root elongation were 18.6 =B5g =
Cu/litre
  and 35.0 =B5g Cu/litre, respectively. Seven-day sediment tests were condu=
cted by
  amending uncontaminated sediments with copper sulfate to mean measured
  concentrations of 7.9, 17.1, 21.0, 51.2, 89.5, and 173.5 mg Cu/kg, which =
were
  _84% of nominal concentrations. Seed germination was not significantly
  different from controls. Mean measured NOEC and LOEC values for seedling =
shoot
  growth were 89.5 mg Cu/kg and 173.5 mg Cu/kg, respectively, and mean meas=
ured
  NOEC and LOEC values for root growth were 14.0 mg Cu/kg and 19.7 mg Cu/kg=

  treated cattle reached a maximum of 8.8=B10.9 ppb at 2 weeks posttreatmen=

  none of the differences was statistically significant. Each exposure of
  sentinel cattle found free-living ticks in both the treated and control
  pastures, indicating that infestation was not eliminated by treatment. Wh=

  enemies on the population dynamics of the southern green stink bug, Nezar=
a
  viridula, in Hawaiian macadamia orchards was investigated during December=
 1994
  -June 1996. We found that the highest kernel damage occurred immediately
  following abrupt reductions in the flowering and fruiting stages of host =
weeds.
  Areas with the greatest diversity of host weeds showed higher damage,
  presumably because of higher N. viridula population levels. Predation rat=
es on
  sentinel egg masses were highest over the two seasons in areas where the
  bigheaded ant, Pheidole megacephala, comprised a large portion of the ant
  fauna. In one of the orchards, P. megacephala and the longlegged ant,
  Anoplolepis longipes [A. gracilipes], occurred in a spatial mosaic where =
the
  boundaries shifted back and forth over time. Sentinel egg masses placed i=
n
  these two adjacent areas showed predation rates were highest in the areas
  dominated by P. megacephala, and intermediate in the interface zone and l=
owest
  where only A. longipes were found. The importance of weed phenology and n=

  sentinel house fly pupae retrieved at two Manitoba dairies in 1996, P. fu=

  parasitized 1998 pupae. A total of 4691 naturally occurring house fly and
  stable fly pupae were collected, of which 9.4% were parasitized by P. fum=
ator.
  P. fumator attacked only pupae in the field. When individual females were
  exposed to pupae and 3rd instar house fly larvae in the laboratory, 52.2 =
and
  5.8% of observations were taken when females were in contact with contain=
ers of
  the pupae and larvae, respectively. At 22=B0C, males of P. fumator had
  significantly shorter development times (24.8=B10.1 days, 14 to 35 days; =
n=3D615)
  than females (26.5=B10.2 days, 18 to 35 days; n=3D147). Some P. fumator d=

  emerge immediately and entered a state of larval diapause. A greater prop=

  of P. fumator in sentinel pupae entered larval diapause (75.8%) than thos=

as a

AB: Malaria continues to have a high morbidity rate associated among Europe=
an
  travellers. Thorough recording of epidemiological and clinical aspects of
  imported malaria has been helpful in the detection of new outbreaks and a=
reas
  of developing drug resistance. Sentinel surveillance of data collected
  prospectively since 1999 has begun within TropNetEurop, a European networ=
k
  focusing on imported infectious diseases. TropNetEurop appears to cover _=
10% of
  all patients with malaria seen in Europe. Reports of 1659 immigrants and
  European patients with Plasmodium falciparum malaria were analysed for
  epidemiological information and data on clinical features. Regional data =
were
  quite diverse, reflecting local patterns of immigration and international
  travel. By far, the most infections were imported from West Africa. Europ=
eans
  had more clinical complications; consequently, all deaths occurred in thi=
s
  group. Compared with European standards, the mortality rate was low (0.6%=
 in
  Europeans). Data from TropNetEurop member sites can contribute to our
  understanding of the epidemiological and clinical findings regarding impo=
rted
  falciparum malaria.

AB: The expanding use of genetically engineered mice has placed increasing
  demands upon research facilities to import mutant strains from non-commer=
cial
  sources. Conventional quarantine strategies use relatively large amounts =
of
  space per animal and/or require specialized equipment (e.g., cubicles,
  isolators, and ventilated racks). We have retrospectively assessed a quar=
antine
  programme instituted 4 years ago that used a small amount of space and
  minimized the need for special equipment. Shipments presumed, in light of
  health reports, to be free of agents excluded from our colonies, were hou=
sed in
  static microisolator caging in a shared quarantine room. Rather than
  functioning as an "all-in-all-out" area, the room continually received ne=
w
  shipments, which were released intermittently as multi-shipment groups af=
ter
  testing was performed. Non-invasive testing of the imported mice was comb=
ined
  with non-survival sampling of sentinels that had been exposed to shipped
  animals via direct contact and/or exposure to soiled bedding. During the =
4-year
  period examined, the vast majority of shipments presumed to be free of ex=
cluded
  agents showed no evidence of contamination when screened. When active inf=
ection
  was detected in the shared room, the procedures in place proved sufficien=
t to
  prevent cross contamination of other shipments. The use of sentinel anima=
ls to
  detect the shedding of infectious agents during quarantine was found to b=
e an
  effective strategy that minimized the potential impact of invasive testin=
g on
  quarantined animals. Although, the programme we describe is not appropria=
te for
  all situations, this type of approach may be considered by institutions w=
ishing
  to explore alternatives to conventional quarantine strategies during peri=
ods of
  restricted space availability.

ed APV
  -negative mallard ducks next to a turkey farm experiencing a severe APV
  outbreak and in an area with a large population of waterfowls. The sentin=
el
  ducks did not develop clinical APV disease, but infectious APV (APV/MN-12=
) was
  recovered from choanal swabs after 2 weeks, and anti-APV antibodies were
  detected after 4 weeks. Four APV isolates recovered from the neighbouring
  turkeys that were experiencing an APV outbreak at the same time, shared 9=
5-99%
  nucleotide identity and 97-99% predicted amino acid identity with the duc=
k
  isolate. In addition, experimental infection of turkey poults with APV/MN=
-12
  resulted in detection of viral RNA in nasal turbinates and APV-specific I=
gG in
  serum. These results indicate that the APV isolates from turkeys and duck=

texts,
  to represent prevalence levels in the general population. In this paper, =
we
  examine the quality of ANC data collected in Thailand, a country that has=
 a
  high acclaimed sentinel surveillance system. Our review shows that ANC
  prevalence data should not be used uncritically. The data have a number o=
f
  limitations stemming from poor geographical coverage of surveillance site=
s,
  limited coverage of facilities, difference in the way data is collected, =
a lack
  of attention to selectivity based on fertility of ANC clients, and limite=
d
  attention to the relationship between male and female prevalence rates.
  However, the paper also suggests that these limitations can be addressed
  through careful assessment and adjustment of the data.

  established at five centres in Yunnan, China, between 1995 and 1997. The
  application of a sensitive antigen capture ELISA to facilitate virus isol=

  procedures led to the isolation of 108 strains of bluetongue (BLU) virus.
  Serotypes isolated included types 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 21 and 2=
3.
  Virus transmission occurred over a period of 1-3 months at each of the fo=
ur
  positive sites, giving an overall BLU virus transmission period for the
  province of 5 months, from early June to early November. The greatest lev=
el of
  transmission took place in July and August. The duration of viraemia in
  individual animals varied from 1 to 7 weeks, with a mean calculated for e=
ach
  serotype between 6 and 20 days. The study represents the first detailed
  investigation of the epidemiology of BLU in China utilizing sentinel herd=

TI: An evaluation of some natural enemies of Nezara viridula in northern

AB: Natural enemies associated with eggs of Nezara viridula (L.) (Heteropte=
ra:
  Pentatomidae) were evaluated by placing sentinel egg masses in weeds and
  cultivated tomato and bean crops in northern California. Egg predation wa=
s
  generally less than 10% and normally involved predators with chewing mout=
h
  parts. Predators seldom destroyed an entire egg mass, typically eating < =
40
  eggs per exploited mass. Laboratory evaluation of > 25 species of potenti=
al
  arthropod predators revealed that few fed on N. viridula eggs to any exte=
nt;
  however, numerous species fed on N. viridula nymphs. Five species of egg
  parasites were recovered from sentinel egg masses: Trissolcus basalis
  (Wollaston), Gryon obesum Masner and Telenomus podisi Ashmead (Scelionida=
e);
  and Ooencyrtus californicus Girault and O. johnsoni (Howard) (Encyrtidae)=
. The
  major egg parasite was T. basalis, the only exotic member of the parasite
  guild; it typically parasitized 100% of the eggs in an exploited egg mass=
. The
  results indicate that parasitization of eggs and predation of small nymph=
s can
  be important biotic mortality factors for N. viridula populations in nort=
hern
  California. It is suggested that a combination of factors -- viz., egg
  parasitization, nymphal predation, regional shortage of overwintering sit=
es,
  and local shortages of suitable hosts -- maintains this exotic pest at
  relatively low levels in the region.

AB: A bin washing apparatus (drencher) was used to treat late-instar codlin=
g
  moth, C. pomonella-infested wooden fruit bins with the entomopathogenic
  nematode S. carpocapsae. Sentinel late-instar codling moth larvae were pl=
aced
  in strips of wood, made from dismantled bins, that were subsequently scre=
wed
  into the corners of real bins before treatment. Pre-soaking the bins with=
 water
  prior to treatment and covering the bins with a plastic tarp post-treatme=
nt, to
  maintain a high humidity, significantly increased sentinel codling moth
  mortality. Treatment for 1 min with 50 S. carpocapsae infective juveniles=
 mL-1
  water resulted in more than 80% mortality over 6 h in which the nematodes=
 were
  continuously pumped through the drencher. The temperature of the water in=
 the
  bin washer was _15=B0C and the chlorine in the city water was too low to =
harm the
  nematodes. The key disadvantage of washing the bins was the labour involv=
ed. It
  may be possible to reduce post-treatment holding time and increase codlin=
g moth
  mortality by holding the bins at a higher temperature post-treatment, how=
ever
  this parameter was not included in the study. The presence of the codling=
 moth
  granulosis virus within the larvae did not influence the nematode-induced
  codling moth mortality over a range of concentrations and two temperature=
s in
  laboratory trials.

  variation in the Venezuelan Amazonia human onchocerciasis (Onchocerca vol=

  focus. Spatial and temporal variation in relative abundance, daily biting=
 rate,
  proportion of parous flies, and monthly parous biting rate were studied f=
or the
  3 main simuliid vectors (based on their vectorial competence: Simulium
  oyapockense sensu lato (s.l.), _S. incrustatum=ABS. guianense s.l.). Yano=
mami
  villages were selected among sentinel communities of the ivermectin contr=
ol
  programme, representing hypo- to hyperendemicity conditions of infection.
  Spatial variation was explored via increasing village altitude on 2 river
  systems (A: Ocamo-Putaco and B: Orinoco-Orinoquito). Temporal variation w=
as
  studied between 1995 and 1999 by sampling the biting population during dr=
y and
  rainy months. Environmental variables included monthly rainfall and maxim=
um
  river height. Simuliid species composition itself varied along the altitu=
dinal
  and prevalence gradient. S. oyapockense s.l. prevailed below 150 m. Above=
 this
  altitude and up to 240 m, S. incrustatum and S. guianense s.l. became mor=
e
  frequently and evenly collected along A but not along B, where S. incrust=
atum
  remained absent. The daily biting rate of S. oyapockense s.l. was higher =
during
  the dry season along A, whereas the converse took place along B. Daily bi=
ting
  rate of S. incrustatum was lowest during early rains. By contrast, the da=
ily
  biting rate of S. guianense s.l. was highest during this period. There wa=
s a
  significant negative cross-correlation between proportion of parous of S.
  oyapockense s.l. and river height (2 and 3 mo lagged), whereas this varia=
ble (1
  and 2 mo lagged) was positively correlated with the proportion of parous =
flies
  for S. incrustatum. Monthly parous biting rate values suggest that the mo=
nths
  contributing most to onchocerciasis transmission in the area are likely t=
o be
  the dry season and the transition periods between seasons.

AB: Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus first appeared in Australia in 1995, w=
hen 3
  clinical cases (2 fatal) were diagnosed in residents on Badu Island in th=
e
  Torres Strait, northern Queensland. More recently, 2 confirmed human JE c=
ases
  were reported in the Torres Strait Islands and Cape York Peninsula, in no=
rthern
  Queensland in 1998. Shortly after JE virus activity was detected in human=
s and
  sentinel pigs on Badu Island in 1998, adult mosquitoes were collected usi=
ng CO2
  and octenol-baited CDC light traps; 43 isolates of JE virus were recovere=
d.
  Although Culex sitiens group mosquitoes yielded the majority of JE isolat=
es
  (42), one isolate was also obtained from Ochlerotatus vigilax. Four isola=
tes of
  Ross River virus and 9 isolates of Sindbis (SIN) virus were also recovere=
d from
  members of the C. sitiens group collected on Badu Island in 1998. In addi=
tion,
  3240 mosquitoes were speciated and pooled after being anaesthetized with
  triethylamine (TEA). There was no significant difference in the minimum
  infection rate of mosquitoes anesthetized with TEA compared with those so=
rted
  on refrigerated tables (2.8 and 1.6 per 1000 mosquitoes, respectively).
  Nucleotide analysis of the premembrane region and an overlapping region o=
f the
  fifth nonstructural protein and 3' untranslated regions of representative=
 1998
  Badu Island isolates of JE virus revealed they were identical to each oth=
er.
  Between 99.1% and 100% identity was observed between 1995 and 1998 isolat=
es of
  JE from Badu Island, as well as isolates of JE from mosquitoes collected =
in
  Papua New Guinea in 1997 and 1998. This suggests that the New Guinea main=
land
  is the likely source of incursions of JE virus in Australia.

AB: An outbreak of paralysis among 16- to 20-week-old CFW Swiss Webster sen=
tinel
  mice developed in one of the barrier facilities of the UCLA School of Med=
icine
  [date not given]. Two months after arrival and over a period of four week=
s, six
  of 400 mice purchased from an approved vendor, developed progressive hind=
 limb
  paralysis without other clinical signs of disease. On the basis of the
  histopathologic changes and negative serologic test results, lymphoblasti=
c
  lymphoma causing compression of the spinal cord was diagnosed. There were=
 two
  leading features to this outbreak: its unusual epidemiologic presentation=
, and
  the localization of the lesions principally in the lumbar muscles. A
  presumptive diagnosis of retroviral infection with Abelson's murine leuka=
emia
  virus (A-MuLV) was established on the basis of histopathologic and
  immunohistochemical findings. Little is known about retroviral status in =
many
  commercial colonies, and few users report presence of spontaneous lymphom=
as.
  This report points out complications derived from commercially available
  animals that carry endogenous retroviruses. It also emphasizes the need o=
f
  diagnosing and reporting clusters of hind limb paralysis or lymphomas in =
mice
  to assess the prevalence and relevance of retroviral infections in commer=

  the percentage of domestic animals in the farms with antibodies against V=
SV IN
  was 57.14%, whereas 73.01% of the animals had antibodies against VSV NJ. =
On the
  other hand, in the wild reservoir, 37.5% had low titre of antibodies, 1:8
  principally, against VSV IN only, for this reason it is suggested that do=
mestic
  and wild cycle of the VSV do not have any relationship. All blood samples=

the
  both serotypes.

AB: Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether HIV-1
  prevalence among antenatal clinic (ANC) attendees in Cambodia provided a
  reasonable estimate of HIV-1 prevalence among all women 15-49 years. Meth=
ods:
  Antenatal clinic attendees in five HIV sentinel surveillance sites (five
  provinces) were selected by consecutive sampling (n=3D1695). The populati=
on
  survey of females by household was carried out in the same 5 areas. House=
hold
  females aged 15-49 years were selected using a three-stage cluster sampli=
ng
  design (n=3D3066). Serum-based HIV ELISA testing was done for both ANC at=
tendees
  and household females. The HIV prevalence for ANC attendees and household
  females were compared by age group and urban versus rural location. Resul=
ts:
  The overall prevalence of HIV-1 infection among ANC attendees (1.62%, 95%=
 CI:
  1.26-1.98) was similar to the overall prevalence obtained from the genera=
l
  population of household females (1.24%, 95% CI: 0.92-1.55) in the same
  catchment areas in Cambodia. In the rural areas, the overall HIV prevalen=
ce
  among ANC attendees (2.18%, 95% CI: 1.59-2.77) was significantly higher t=
han
  among the household females (0.86%, 95% CI: 0.49-1.23) after adjustment f=
or age
  distribution and education level. In the 15-24 age group in rural areas, =
the
  HIV prevalence of ANC women was 2.71% (95% CI: 0.96-4.46) compared with 0=
.77%
  (95% CI: 0.02-1.53) in household females. Conclusions: Although ANC data =
can be
  used to estimate trends over time, it should be realized that ANC data ma=
y
  overestimate the actual prevalence in the younger age group in rural area=
s in
  Cambodia.

AB: Although considerable information has accumulated in the last decade
  regarding rates of both vaginal colonization and vulvovaginal candidosis =

  in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive women, gaps in our knowled=
ge
  remain, particularly with regard to pathophysiology of clinical disease.
  Unfortunately, early and possibly premature conclusions were reached in t=

  late 1980s which resulted in the widespread dissemination of information
  indicating that recurrent VVC (RVVC) was a manifestation of HIV infection=
 and
  that women with RVVC should be tested for HIV. Unfortunately, subsequent =
data
  from cohort studies involving HIV-positive women failed to determine atta=

  rates of symptomatic Candida vaginitis requiring therapy. Recent studies
  indicate that Candida vaginitis, even if more frequent in HIV infected wo=
men,
  is clinically similar to that experienced in HIV-negative women and does =
not
  appear to be of increased clinical severity. VVC in HIV-positive women ca=
n be
  treated by conventional methods including the use of maintenance suppress=

  antifungal therapy and most importantly RVVC in women is not in itself a

ere
  performed in Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) taken from the river Se=
ine,
  in six populations located upstream and downstream from the city of Rouen
  (France). The results indicate that this bivalve species agressively
  accumulates these contaminants and thus can be used as a sentinel organis=
m for
  the monitoring of water quality in the Seine river. Two stations were of
  particular interest for the contamination pattern of mussels. Animals tak=
en in
  the station La Bouille, located just downstream from Rouen harbour, exhib=
ited
  the highest levels in PAH and the second highest in PCB and Cd, thus indi=
cating
  that contaminants originating from the city and industrial zone of Rouen
  contribute to the contamination levels of biota in the Seine river. Musse=
ls
  from the station Vieux-Port were characterized by PCB and PAH burdens
  noticeably different from those measured in animals originating from the =
other
  sites, especially as they had the highest levels in toxic PCB congeners i=
n term
  of dioxin-equivalent toxicity. Measurement by immunological methods of th=
e
  expression of multixenobiotic resistance proteins (MXR) in the gills of Z=
ebra
  mussels indicate that the animals from the station La Bouille had the hig=
hest
  concentrations of those proteins. Globally, animals living at and downstr=
eam
  from La Bouille exhibit higher levels of MXR proteins, suggesting therefo=
re
  that they are more exposed to various toxing than those animals living up=
stream.

AB: To study a novel surveillance system introduced in Mpumalanga Province,=
 a
  rural area in the north-east of South Africa, in an attempt to address
  deficiencies in the system of notification for infectious conditions that=
 have
  the potential for causing outbreaks. Hospital-based infection control nur=
ses in
  all of Mpumalanga's 32 public and private hospitals were trained to recog=
nize,
  report, and respond to nine clinical syndromes that require immediate act=
ion.
  Sustainability of the system was assured through a schedule of regular tr=
aining
  and networking, and by providing feedback to the nurses. The system was
  evaluated by formal review of hospital records, evidence of the effective
  containment of a cholera outbreak, and assessment of the speed and
  appropriateness of responses to other syndromes. Rapid detection, reporti=
ng and
  response to six imported cholera cases resulted in effective containment,=
 with
  only 19 proven secondary cholera cases, during the two-year review period=
. No
  secondary cases followed detection and prompt response to 14 patients wit=
h
  meningococcal disease. By the end of the first year of implementation, al=
l
  facilities were providing weekly zero-reports on the nine syndromes befor=
e the
  designated time. Formal hospital record review for cases of acute flaccid
  paralysis endorsed the value of the system. The primary goal of an outbre=
ak
  surveillance system is to ensure timely recognition of syndromes requirin=
g an
  immediate response. Infection control nurses in Mpumalanga hospitals have
  excelled in timely weekly zero-reporting, participation at monthly traini=
ng and
  feedback sessions, detection of priority clinical syndromes, and prompt
  appropriate response. This review provides support for the role of hospit=
al
  -based nurses as valuable sentinel surveillance agents providing timely d=
ata
  for action.

AB: A total of 187 different species of arboviruses and other viruses in
  vertebrates were identified at the Evandro Chagas Institute (IEC) from 19=
54 to
  1998, among more than 10,000 arbovirus strains isolated from humans,
  haematophagous insects, and wild and sentinel vertebrates. Despite intens=
ive
  studies in the Brazilian Amazon region, especially in Para State, very li=
ttle
  is known about most of these viruses, except for information on date, tim=
e,
  source, and method of isolation, as well as their capacity to infect labo=
ratory
  animals. This paper reviews ecological and epidemiological data and analy=
zes
  the impact of vector and host population changes on various viruses as a =
result
  of profound changes in the natural environment. Deforestation, mining, da=

AB: A study was conducted to evaluate the impact of human immunodeficiency =
virus
  (HIV) infection on fertility among women attending antenatal clinics in B=
obo
  -Dioulasso (Burkina Faso) and its possible implications on HIV sentinel
  surveillance. Voluntary counselling and HIV testing were proposed to 1349=
 women
  aged _18 years who were carrying a pregnancy of 7 months or less. During =
pre
  -test counselling sessions, a standardized questionnaire was administered=
 to
  collect detailed information regarding socio-demographic characteristics =
and
  obstetrical history. After written informed consent, blood samples were t=
aken
  for HIV testing. Mean age (=B1standard deviation) at first sexual interco=
urse was
  similar among HIV-positive (n=3D83) and -negative (n=3D1336) women (16.7=
=B12 and
  16.9=B12 years, respectively). However, HIV-positive women aged _25 years=
 (n=3D37)
  had, on the average, fewer pregnancies than HIV-negative women (n=3D567) =
of the
  same age (3.8=B11.5 and 5.0=B12.3, respectively; P < 0.01). Similarly, th=
ese HIV
  -positive women (n=3D35) had, on the average, less live births than HIV-n=
egative
  ones (n=3D555) (2.8=B11.3 and 3.7=B12.1), respectively; (P=3D0.02). Other=
 sexual and
  obstetrical characteristics, i.e. maternal age, proportion of primigravid=
a,
  stillbirths, spontaneous abortions, were comparable in the two groups. Th=
ese
  data suggest that the level of fertility of HIV-positive women aged _25 y=
ears
  is significantly lower than HIV-negative women. Thus, HIV-positive women =
in
  this age group are likely to be under-represented among antenatal clinic
  attendees. In order to derive a good estimate of community HIV prevalence=
,
  adjustment of antenatal clinic-based HIV sentinel surveillance data for a=
ge and
  fertility is suggested.

AB: Within the scope of the multidisciplinary research project Valimar (199=
5
  -1999), the present study emphasizes the use of histopathological
  investigations to evaluate the effects of the different chemical impact o=
f 2
  small streams on the general health and condition of the 2 sentinel fish
  species, brown trout (Salmo trutta f. fario) and loach (Barbatula barbatu=
la),
  in Germany. Parasitological investigations were also included to assess a
  possible relationship between toxicant exposure, parasitic load and the
  occurrence of histopathological organ changes. According to the multi-tie=
red
  approach of the Valimar project, fish from the field, individuals exposed=
 to
  stream water under semi-field conditions, and fish from laboratory experi=
ments
  were investigated. Under semi-field conditions, the histopathological res=
ponses
  in brown trout proved to reflect the different levels of contamination of=
 the 2
  small streams more clearly than those detected in loach. When captured fr=
om the
  field, both fish species revealed, in most cases, a higher degree of
  histopathological alterations than those individuals exposed at the respe=
ctive
  site under semi-field conditions. Simulation of the toxic load of the mor=
e
  polluted stream in a laboratory experiment did not result in the same kin=
d of
  tissue lesions in brown trout as in the field and semi-field investigatio=
ns.
  Whereas results from the laboratory experiments could be specified as 'to=
xicant
  -induced', the histopathological alterations in fish from both semi-field=
 and
  field studies represent stress responses which integrate the effects of v=
arious
  abiotic and biotic stress factors including both toxicants and parasitic
  diseases.

AB: Freshwater nematomorphs, or gordiids, are parasitic as larvae, but free
  -living in aquatic environments as adults. Studies based on the collectio=
n of
  adults have reported gordiids to be widespread, but discontinuous in
  distribution. However, a relatively short adult life span and unknown lif=
e
  history make the detection of adults difficult. An alternative approach t=
o
  investigate gordiid distribution is to use cysts. Of all paratenic hosts,
  snails (Physa gyrina) were chosen because they lacked internal defence
  reactions to the cysts and became easily infected. Here, it is reported t=
hat
  the occurrence of gordiids on the basis of the cyst stage is much more co=
mmon
  than previously reported, thus altering the perception of how common thes=
e
  worms are. Using this modified survey procedure, gordiid cysts were found=
 at
  70% of sites (Nebraska, USA) examined between September 1999 and May 2000=
, in
  an area where extensive sampling over 3 years yielded adults only at a si=
ngle
  site. Of 1000 snails dissected, 395 were infected with gordiids (intensit=
y
  range: 1-465). Furthermore, different types of human-modified landscapes =
did
  not affect gordiid distribution, suggesting that as urban and suburban ar=
eas
  sprawl, human encounters or pseudoparasitism with nematomorphs may increa=
se.
  The results of this study indicate that the use of organismal-specific sa=
mpling
  techniques can be critical in studies of parasite distribution and biodiv=
ersity.

  conducted in Zanzibar (comprises 2 main islands, Pemba and Unguja) Tanzan=
ia,
  between 27 and 28 October 2001. Baseline surveys for parasitological and
  clinical manifestation were undertaken in 2 sentinel sites, one rural and=
 the
  other urban. A door-to-door strategy was chosen as the method of drug
  administration. For effective coverage 4000 drug distributors were select=
ed and
  trained, each responsible for drug administration in 50 households. A sur=
vey to
  assess the drug coverage rate was carried out one week after the drug
  distribution. 39 sites in the 2 islands were randomly selected and 600-90=
0
  people per site were interviewed, giving a total number of 26143 people. =
The
  results showed an overall drug coverage rate of 76% (79% in Uguja and 71%=
 in
  Pemba, which reflect the 92.1% and 85.6% of people who swallowed the drug=
s
  among the eligible population, respectively). Eight percent of the people=
 who
  swallowed the drugs reported side effects.

  in treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria 3 years after
  introduction in Mpumalanga, South Africa. Setting: Tonga district with a
  population of 116418 and subject to seasonal malaria, with an average ann=
ual
  incidence of 3200 cases. Subjects: 119 malaria patients presenting to a
  sentinel surveillance clinic and recruited according to World Health
  Organisation (WHO) criteria between January and May 2000. Methodology: Pa=
tients
  satisfying WHO inclusion criteria were treated with a single oral dose of=
 SP
  and the response of infection to treatment in each patient was routinely
  monitored clinically and parasitologically on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28=
 and
  42 post-treatment. 110 patients completed follow-up to day 42 or evidence=
 of
  clinical or parasitological failure. Results: The cure rate at day 42 was=
 93.6%
  (103/110). Two patients (1.8%, RII) were early treatment failures on day =
3,
  while recrudescence (4.5%, RI) occurred in 5 patients on day 28 (N=3D3) a=
nd on
  day 42 (N=3D2). Conclusion: In Mpumalanga P. falciparum remains sensitive=
 to SP,
  with no significant difference between the baseline cure rate (94.5%) and=
 the
  cure rate in the present study (93.6%).

 the
  number of infections in 1999 was calculated. The model shows a significan=

AB: In mid-January 2000, the reappearance of Japanese encephalitis (JE) vir=
us
  activity in the Australasian region was first demonstrated by the isolati=
on of
  JE virus from 3 sentinel pigs on Badu Island in the Torres Strait. Furthe=
r
  evidence of JE virus activity was revealed through the isolation of JE vi=
rus
  from Culex gelidus mosquitoes collected on Badu Island and the detection =
of
  specific JE virus neutralizing antibodies in 3 pigs from Saint Pauls comm=
unity
  on Moa Island. Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of the
  premembrane and envelope genes were performed which showed that both the =
pig
  and mosquito JE virus isolates (TS00 and TS4152, respectively) clustered =
in
  genotype I, along with northern Thai, Cambodian, and Korean isolates. All
  previous Australasian JE virus isolates belong to genotype II, along with
  Malaysian and Indonesian isolates. Therefore, for the first time, the
  appearance and transmission of a 2nd genotype of JE virus in the Australa=
sian
  region has been demonstrated.

AB: The first reports of West Nile virus (WNV) infection in the United Stat=
es in
  1999 prompted Ontario to establish a surveillance protocol to monitor for=
 the
  possible spread of the virus into the province. Surveillance components
  included evaluation of dead birds, sentinel fowls, mosquito pools and hum=
an
  disease. We report the results of human surveillance in 2000. Between 1 J=
uly
  and 31 October 2000, an active surveillance programme was undertaken in w=
hich
  designated site coordinators in sentinel hospitals identified patients wh=
o met
  the suspect case definition (fever and fluctuating level of consciousness=
 or
  encephalopathy, with or without muscle weakness). During the same period,
  following province-wide distribution of educational material, all other
  patients tested for WNV antibodies were identified through review of prov=
incial
  laboratory reports (laboratory-based enhanced passive surveillance). Of 6=
0
  hospitals contacted, 59 agreed to participate in the active surveillance
  programme; 52 provided information on a regular (weekly) basis and 7 subm=
itted
  fewer than 8 reports. Thirty-six (61%) of the sentinel sites reported sus=
pect
  cases. In total, 188 patients were tested (130 identified through active
  surveillance and 58 through enhanced passive surveillance). Patients iden=
tified
  through active surveillance were more likely than those identified throug=
h
  passive surveillance to meet the suspect case definition (43% [n=3D56] vs=
. 7%
  [n=3D4]), to be admitted to hospital (75% [n=3D99] vs. 16% [n=3D9]), to h=
ave a longer
  hospital stay (mean 25 vs. 3 days), to have had a second (convalescent) s=
erum
  sample collected (37%; n=3D48 vs. 31%; n=3D18), to have had a cerebrospin=
al fluid
  (CSF) sample banked (56%; n=3D73 vs. 14%; n=3D8) and to have had a discha=
rge
  diagnosis reported (79%; n=3D103 vs. 28%; n=3D16). Of 60 patients (32%) w=
ho met the
  suspect case definition, 34 (57%; 31 active, 3 passive) had a discharge
  diagnosis of encephalitis. Of these, 17 (50%; 15 active, 2 passive) had p=
aired
  serum samples collected, and 18 (51%; all active) had a CSF sample banked=
. The
  reported causal agents were herpes simplex virus (n=3D8), varicella virus=
 (n=3D2),
  Powassan virus (n=3D1), echovirus 30 (n=3D1) and group B Streptococcus (n=
=3D1); the
  cause was unknown in 18 cases. One patient died of encephalitis. The rema=
ining
  26 patients who met the suspect case definition were ultimately found to =
have
  nonencephalitic infections, vascular events or alcohol- or drug-related
  illness. The 128 (68%) tested for WNV who did not meet the suspect case
  definition included 9 patients ultimately discharged with a diagnosis of
  encephalitis. No cases of WNV infection were identified. Only one-third o=
f the
  tested patients met the suspect case definition of encephalopathy on admi=
ssion,
  and nearly half of them were later found to have another diagnosis; other=
s did
  not meet the case definition but were later discharged with a diagnosis o=
f
  encephalitis. This affirms that identification of acute encephalitis on t=
he
  basis of symptoms at the time of admission is often impossible.

AB: The objective of this study was to evaluate the mechanical transmission=
 of
  porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) from infected=
 to
  susceptible pigs by needles. Four replicates of this study were conducted=
, each
  involving 15 four-week-old PRRSC-naive pigs. Each replicate consisted of =
three
  groups, and each group was housed in a separate room. Group 1, the infect=
ed
  group, consisted of 10 pigs, group 2, the sentinel group, consisted of th=
ree
  pigs, and group 3, the negative control group, consisted of two pigs. The=
 pigs
  were injected on days 5, 6 and 7 after inoculation of group 1. Person A
  administered 2 ml of vaccine to all pigs in group 1 intramuscularly. The =
same
  syringe was used to inject all 10 pigs, and a killed Mycoplasma hyopneumo=
niae
  bacterin was used as it is frequently administered to nursery pigs on
  commercial farm. In all four replicates, successful infection of inoculat=
ed
  pigs in group 1 was demonstrated. PRRSV was detected on day 14 after
  inoculation in all seven inoculated pigs. Infection of group 2 pigs occur=
red in
  two of the four replicates. Group 2 pigs were viraemic on day 7 or day 14=
 after
  exposure. All pigs developed PRRSV antibodies on day 21 after exposure. T=
he
  group 3 negative-control pigs remained ELISA negative throughout the stud=
y. The
  results of this study suggest that contaminated needles can serve as mech=
anical
  vectors of PRRSV.

AB: This study attempted control of transmission of E. granulosus from dogs=
 to
  sheep in different areas of the Department of Florida, Uruguay, by treati=
ng
  dogs with praziquantel at intervals of 6, 12 and 16 weeks. The 6-week int=
erval
  was based on the prepatent period of infection with E. granulosus, the 12=
- and
  16-week intervals were based on the rate of reinfection with tapeworms in=
 dogs
  in the area. Dogs had become reinfected with E. granulosus between 2 and =
4
  months after treatment, whereas they became reinfected with the Taenia sp=
p.
  tapeworms within 2 months of treatment. One year after the start of treat=
ments,
  sentinel lambs were born and grazed the farms in the three treatment area=
s.
  Approximately 15 months later when the sentinel lambs were killed and exa=
mined
  for parasites, the six weekly treatments had stopped the transmission of =
E.
  granulosus to the sentinel lambs. Treatment of dogs at 12- and 16-week
  intervals failed to stop transmission of E. granulosus, but both the numb=
ers of
  farms and the numbers of sheep infected with E. granulosus were lower whe=
re
  dogs received 12 weekly treatments compared with dogs receiving 16 weekly
  treatments and a fourth area where dogs had received no treatments
  (chi2P=3D0.002). Lambs continued to become infected with the Taenia spp.
  tapeworms in all the areas. Control was complicated by large changes in t=
he dog
  population. From a starting population of 1164 dogs in the three treated =
areas,
  832 new dogs, most of these adult hunting dogs, entered the population an=
d 793
  dogs were lost from the population.

AB: Three infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) isolates, CU82792, CU82805, and
  CU82808, were recovered from sentinel chickens placed with three differen=
t
  layer flocks of a large commercial poultry farm in New York, USA (Februar=
y and
  March 2000). The three isolates were classified as members of the DE072
  serotype on the basis of: (i) their S1 genes could be amplified with only=
 a
  modified primer designed for the DE072 serotype and (ii) their restrictio=
n
  fragment length polymorphism patterns, after digestion with endonucleases
  HaeIII, BstyI and XcmI, were indistinguishable from that of DE072 virus.
  Additional characterization of one of the isolates, CU82805, revealed tha=
t its
  S1 gene bears approximately 96% identity at the nucleotide level and 94%
  identity at the amino acid level with DE072. Yet, in an in vitro reciproc=
al
  virus neutralization test, only a one-way neutralization was observed, i.=
e.,
  antiserum to CU82805 neutralized DE072, whereas CU82805 was not neutraliz=
ed by
  DE072 antiserum. Implications of these findings with regard to IBV diagno=

  and immunization are discussed. Nucleotide and amino acid sequences repor=

allow
  parasites to develop, thus enhancing the evaluation of hypobiotic stages.
  Following this holding period, necropsies were performed for complete par=

  occurring in the winter and only minimal transmission taking place in the
  summer. Numbers of mucosal cyathostomes, as well as total cyathostome num=

AB: The safety of a live modified virus vaccine is largely dependent on the
  ability of the virus to spread to non-vaccinated animals. This experiment
  assessed the ability of Porcilis porcine reproductive and respiratory syn=
drome
  (PRRS) vaccine virus to spread from vaccinated to fully susceptible pigs.=
 The
  experiment was carried out in a single building housing 78 vaccinated gro=
wers
  in the treatment group and 42 fully susceptible pigs, including sows, in =
the
  sentinel group. The animals were managed under normal husbandry condition=
s.
  Blood samples were collected every 3 weeks, in a total of 7 sampling sess=
ions.
  Serum samples were tested for sero-conversion by Blocking ELISA, and for
  viraemia by the IPMA method. All animals were sero-negative at the start.
  During the trial period, 76 vaccinated growers, 4 sentinel sows and 1 sen=
tinel
  grower sero-converted. Viraemia was detected in 23 vaccinated growers and=
 in 1
  sentinel sow, 3 weeks after vaccination, and in one vaccinated grower, 6 =
weeks
  after vaccination. No adverse reactions were observed. The spread of vacc=
ine
  virus can be identified by the time of infection and the location of the
  infected individual in the building. Based on the combined results, an es=
timate
  of the basic reproduction ratio of the virus was calculated as R0=3D0.06.=
 It was
  concluded that the vaccine virus did spread, but the spread was limited t=
o a
  small proportion of the susceptible animals, and was self-limiting.

AB: Objectives: To determine if porcine reproductive and respiratory syndro=
me
  virus (PRRSV) can be transmitted to susceptible pigs by fomites or people
  exposed to infected pigs. Methods: 96 four-week-old pigs from a PRRSV-nai=
ve
  source were organized into 6 groups. The animals were individually housed=
 in
  isolation rooms (4 replicate trials, 24 pigs per trial). Group 1 pigs wer=
e
  inoculated intranasally with PRRSV strain VR-2332 (2 ml, 105 median tissu=
e
  culture infective doses per ml). On days 5, 6 and 7 post inoculation,
  investigators exposed to Group 1 pigs attempted to transmit PRRSV to sent=
inel
  pigs (Groups 2 to 5) by contact. After exposure to the infected pigs, an
  investigator entered the Group 2 room (Direct Contact group) wearing
  contaminated boots and coveralls and without washing hands. In contrast,
  investigators who entered the rooms housing Groups 3 to 5 were required t=
o
  complete specific sanitation protocols, which included changing boots and
  coveralls and washing hands (Danish System, Group 3); changing boots and
  coveralls, showering, and 12 h down time (Standard Protocol, Group 4); an=
d
  changing boots and coveralls and showering, with no down time (Alternativ=
e
  Protocol, Group 5). Results: PRRSV was detected on contaminated coveralls=
,
  boots and hands of investigators who had contact with Group 1 pigs.
  Transmission of PRRSV occurred between Groups 1 and 2, but not with Group=
 1 and
  Groups 3, 4, or 5. Implications: PRRSV can be transmitted to susceptible =
pigs
  by contaminated fomites (boots and coveralls) and hands; however, the use=
 of
  sanitation protocols appears to limit its spread.

AB: Late-spawning Fraser River sockeye salmon, O. nerka, stocks have suffer=
ed
  significant pre-spawn mortality associated with an unusually early freshw=
ater
  migration pattern and the myxosporean parasite, P. minibicornis. Surveys =
of
  migrating adult salmon from several spawning populations were conducted i=
n 1999
  and 2000 to determine the extent of infection with P. minibicornis, when =
and
  where the parasite first became detectable during migration, and whether =
early
  migrating stocks might be used as sentinels to assess risk of infection i=
n late
  -spawning stocks. Posterior kidney, preserved in 95% ethanol, was examine=
d for
  P. minibicornis in stained histological sections and using a polymerase c=
hain
  reaction (PCR) test. The prevalence of this parasite in all Fraser River
  sockeye salmon stocks examined was high (range 47-100% infected). In cont=
rast,
  P. minibicornis was not detected in the fish tested from the 2 sockeye sa=
lmon
  stocks outside the Fraser River drainage in either 1999 or 2000. The para=
site
  was also not detected histologically or by PCR in the kidney tissue of th=
e fish
  from the Fraser River that were sampled in salt water or early during the=
ir
  freshwater migration up the river. These findings and the progression in =
the
  prevalence and intensity of infection as the fish from 3 stocks (early St=
uart,
  Weaver Creek and Cultus Lake) were monitored over time, suggest that the =
salmon
  acquired the parasite either in the lower Strait of Georgia or in the low=
er
  Fraser River before the confluence of the Harrison River. In both 1999 an=
d
  2000, the parasite was present in all Fraser River sockeye salmon stocks
  sampled, which suggests that early Stuart salmon may be valuable as a sen=
tinel
  stock for the presence of the parasite in later-spawning stocks.

AB: An objective of the Workers' Health Program at the Pan American Health
  Organization (PAHO) is to strengthen surveillance in workers' health in t=
he
  Region of the Americas in order to implement prevention and control strat=
egies.
  To date, 4 phases of projects have been organized to develop multinationa=
l
  workplace health and hazard surveillance in the Region. Phase 1 was a wor=
kshop
  held in 1999 in Washington, D.C., USA, for the purpose of developing a
  methodology for identifying and prioritizing the top 3 occupational senti=
nel
  health events to be incorporated into the surveillance systems in the Reg=
ion.
  Three surveillance protocols were developed, one each for fatal occupatio=
nal
  injuries, pesticide poisoning, and low back pain, which were identified i=
n the
  workshop as the most important occupational health problems. Phase 2 comp=
rised
  projects to disseminate the findings and recommendations of the Washingto=
n
  Workshop, including publications, pilot projects, software development,
  electronic communication, and meetings. Phase 3 was a sub-regional meetin=
g in
  2000 in Rosario, Argentina, to follow up on the progress in carrying out =
the
  recommendations of the Washington workshop and to create a Virtual Region=
al
  Centre for Latin America that could coordinate the efforts of member coun=
tries.
  Currently phase 4 includes a number of projects to achieve the objectives=
 of
  this Centre, such as pilot projects, capacity building, editing a compact=
 disk,
  analysing legal systems and intervention strategies, software training, a=
nd
  developing an internet course on surveillance. By documenting the joint e=
fforts
  made to initiate and develop Regional multinational surveillance of
  occupational injuries and diseases in the Americas, this paper aims to pr=
ovide
  experience and guidance for others wishing to initiate and develop region=
al
  multinational surveillance for other diseases or in other regions.

AB: Several species of anuran amphibians have undergone drastic population
  declines in the western United States over the last 10 to 15 years. In
  California, the most severe declines are in the Sierra Mountains east of =
the
  Central Valley and downwind of the intensely agricultural San Joaquin Val=
ley.
  In contrast, coastal and more northern populations across from the less
  agrarian Sacramento Valley are stable or declining less precipitously. In=
 this
  article, we provide evidence that pesticides are instrumental in declines=
 of
  these species. Using Hyla regilla as a sentinel species, we found that
  cholinesterase (ChE) activity in tadpoles was depressed in mountainous ar=
eas
  east of the Central Valley compared with sites along the coast or north o=
f the
  Valley. Cholinesterase was also lower in areas where ranid population sta=
tus
  was poor or moderate compared with areas with good ranid status. Up to 50=
% of
  the sampled population in areas with reduced ChE had detectable
  organophosphorus residues, with concentrations as high as 190 ppb wet wei=
ght.
  In addition, up to 86% of some populations had measurable endosulfan
  concentrations and 40% had detectable 4,4'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethyle=
ne,
  4,4'-DDT, and 2,4'-DDT residues.

AB: A standardized model of Streptococcus suis type 2 infection in specific

e the
  virulence of 3 French field strains of S. suis serotype 2 isolated from t=
onsils
  of a healthy pig (strain 65) or from diseased pigs (meningitis, strain 16=
6', or
  septicemia, strain 24). In one of the 2 trials, 7-week-old pigs, in 3 gro=
ups of
  8, were inoculated intravenously with 2 x 108 colony-forming units of S. =
suis
  type 2. In each group, 1 uninfected animal was a sentinel. Eight animals =
were
  also used as negative control group. The experiment was repeated under si=
milar
  conditions with strains 65 and 166'. Virulence differed markedly among th=
ese S.
  suis strains when clinical signs, zootechnical performances, lesions, and
  bacteriological data were analyzed. Strain 65 did not induce clinical sig=
ns in
  inoculated pigs. In contrast, pigs infected with the other 2 strains exhi=
bited
  clinical signs and typical lesions of S. suis type 2 infections. Differen=
ces in
  virulence were also observed between the 2 virulent strains. Sentinel ani=
mals
  exhibited the same manifestations as those recorded in inoculated piglets=
.
  Results were similar in the second trial, indicating that under the prese=
nt
  experimental conditions, results were reproducible. The standardized cond=
itions
  described in this study could be a useful tool to further study about the=
 S.
  suis infection.

AB: The cost effectiveness of enzootic arbovirus (western equine encephalit=
is
  and St Louis encephalitis viruses) surveillance methods in northern Calif=
ornia,
  i.e antibody detection in sentinel chickens, virus isolation from mosquit=
oes
  and antibody detection in wild avian hosts, was compared. Total and annua=
l
  recurring costs were determined for each method based on estimated person=
nel
  and actual material and travel costs for biweekly surveillance at 3 sites=
 in
  the Sacramento Valley from 1 May to mid-October 1997 and 1998. Serologica=
l
  detection of antibodies in wild birds was the most expensive method. Tota=
l
  costs associated with sentinel chickens and mosquitoes combined were less=
 than
  half of those for the wild bird program. Recurring annual costs for the w=
ild
  bird and mosquito methods were only slightly less than expenses for those
  methods during the first year of operation, which included nonrecurring s=
etup
  costs. Recurring costs for sentinel chickens were reduced ~40% from total=
 costs
  during the first year of the programme and were < 14% of recurring costs =
for
  wild bird serology. Exceptions and caveats of our analysis are discussed.=
 When
  considering the data from a companion paper on detection of enzootic viru=
s
  transmission using the 3 methods, it is concluded that the current system=
 that
  combines sentinel chickens and virus isolation from mosquitoes is the mos=
t cost
  -effective and efficient surveillance programme and should be retained. F=
uture
  research efforts should investigate the costs and surveillance efficiency=
 of

AB: Previous studies have demonstrated no difference in micronucleus (MN)
  frequencies between wild rodents chronically exposed to the environmental
  radiation contamination of the Chornobyl [Chernobyl] (Ukraine) exclusion =
zone
  and those inhabiting reference populations. The aim of the present study =
was to
  test the hypothesis that a population of bank voles (Clethrionomys glareo=
lus)
  has developed radioresistance as a result of 14 years of chronic, low-dos=
e
  radiation exposure. Naive voles were placed in environmental enclosures i=
n the
  Red Forest region of the exclusion zone for 30 days. Blood samples were
  obtained at regular intervals, and the MN assay was used to assess chromo=
somal
  damage. Additionally, radionuclide uptake was monitored throughout the st=
udy,
  and dose was documented for each individual as well as for their offsprin=
g.
  Total dose for the voles experimentally exposed in this environment avera=
ged
  1.09 Gy (36.20 mGy d-1) for the 30-day study period. Our results indicate=
 that
  exposure to radiation levels well above regulatory statutes did not resul=
t in
  an increased MN frequency. Furthermore, our results do not support the
  hypothesis that voles chronically exposed to these radiation levels have
  developed a genetic basis for radioresistance that is unique from that pr=
esent
  in naive populations. The use of C. glareolus as a sentinel species for
  environmental studies of radiation contamination and the question of whet=
her
  the MN assay is an appropriate endpoint for studies of low-dose, chronic
  radiation exposure are also discussed.

AB: The garden snail (Helix aspersa) is currently used as bioindicator of
  metallic pollution. Our objective was to extend its use to organic chemic=
als by
  studying the effects and tissue concentrations of the organophosphorus
  pesticide dimethoate following dietary uptake. After exposure for four we=
eks to
  increasing doses of pesticide in the diet, the median lethal concentratio=
n
  (LC50) was determined to be 3700 =B5g/g food. Clinical signs indicated a =
no
  -observed-effect concentration of 100 =B5g/g and a lowest-observed-effect
  concentration of 250 =B5g/g. The growth parameters were decreased with in=
creasing
  exposure to the pesticide. The median effective concentration (EC50), whi=
ch was
  evaluated based on both shell diameter and dry weight inhibitions, was 66=
5 and
  424 =B5g/g, respectively, and the EC10 was 180 and 145 =B5g/g, respective=
ly.
  Accumulation in the viscera was related to the amount of dimethoate in th=
e
  food. The bioconcentration factors were low ( > 6 x 10-3). Acetylcholines=
terase
  (AChE) activity was strongly decreased (80% from 250 =B5g/g). In conclusi=
on, we
  demonstrated that the species H. aspersa could be a useful sentinel organ=
ism
  for organophosphorus contamination surveys. Among the effects measured, t=
he
  inhibition of AChE activities and clinical signs were the most sensitive,
  followed by the growth parameters. These results confirm the suitability =
of the
  garden snail for development of sublethal toxicity tests using primary
  consumers and aboveground organisms.

AB: Children are the most susceptible population to lead exposure because o=
f
  three interacting factors; they have more opportunity for contact with le=
ad
  sources due to their activities, lead absorption occurs more readily in a=
 child
  compared to an adult, and the child's development is more vulnerable to l=
ead
  than adults. Low levels of lead in the blood have been shown to cause adv=
erse
  health effects; the level of concern for children is currently 10 =B5g/dl=
. The
  contribution of dietary exposure of lead to increased blood lead levels (=
PbB)
  is not well characterized. This study was conducted to measure potential
  dietary lead intakes of children 2 to 3 years of age who live in homes
  contaminated with environmental lead. Objectives were to estimate lead in=
takes
  for children consuming food in contaminated environments, recognizing
  unstructured eating patterns and to investigate if correlations exist bet=
ween
  daily dietary exposure and measured PbB. Dietary exposure was evaluated b=
y
  collecting samples that were typical of the foods the young children ate =
in
  their homes. A 24-h duplicate of all foods plus sentinel foods, i.e.,
  individual items used to represent foods contaminated during handling, we=
re
  collected from 48 children. Ten homes were revisited to obtain informatio=
n on
  the variation in daily dietary intakes. Drinking water was evaluated both=
 as
  part of the segregated beverage sample composite and by itself. Additiona=
l
  information collected included lead concentrations from hand wipes, floor
  wipes, and venous blood, and questionnaire responses from the caregiver o=
n
  activities potentially related to exposure. Activities and hygiene practi=
ces of
  the children and contamination of foods in their environment influences t=
otal
  dietary intake. Estimated mean dietary intakes of lead (29.2 =B5g Pb/day)=
 were
  more than three times the measured 24-h duplicate-diet levels (8.37 =B5g =
Pb/day),
  which were almost six times higher than current national estimates (1.4 =
=B5g
  Pb/day). Statistically significant correlations were observed between flo=
or
  wipes and foods contacting contaminated surfaces, hand wipes and foods
  contacting contaminated hands and surfaces, and hand wipes and floor wipe=
s.
  This study indicates that the dietary pathway of exposure to lead is impa=
cted
  by eating activities of children living in lead-contaminated environments=
 and
  that analysis of foods themselves is not enough to determine excess dieta=
ry
  exposures that are occurring.

AB: A systematic search of the peer-reviewed biomedical literature was perf=
ormed
  for original studies linking environmental hazards with health effects in=
 wild
  animal populations. Some 104 original studies were identified in the BIOS=
IS and
  Medline databases since 1966 and classified in terms of study design. A m=
arked
  increase in published studies had occurred over the past decade, examinin=
g a
  wide range of hazards and outcomes. Most analytical studies were ecologic=
al or
  cross-sectional in nature. All cross-sectional studies sampled subjects o=
n the
  basis of exposure, using a reference population for the selection of cont=
rols.
  Studies of wild animal populations may hold unique advantages for toxican=
t
  hazard identification, yet the current range of study designs appeared
  restricted. Increased use of study approaches such as sampling based on
  outcome, intra-population comparisons, as well as cohort and case-control
  designs may improve hazard identification and priority setting for confir=
matory
  toxicological and human studies of effects seen in wildlife.

WN)
  virus outbreak in the summer and fall of 1999 in New York State resulted =
in
  bird deaths in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, USA. From August to
  December 1999, 295 dead birds were laboratory-confirmed with WN virus
  infection; 262 (89%) were American Crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos). The New=
 York
  State Department of Health received reports of 17339 dead birds, includin=
g 5697
  (33%) crows; in Connecticut 1040 dead crows were reported. Bird deaths we=

  critical in identifying WN virus as the cause of the human outbreak and
  defining its geographic and temporal limits. If established before a WN v=
irus
  outbreak, a surveillance system based on bird deaths may provide a sensit=
ive

AB: Nine isolates from pigs persistently infected with a recent Italian iso=
late
  of swine vesicular disease (SVD) virus, ITL/9/93, were collected sequenti=
ally
  over 121 days and were characterized antigenically and biochemically. The=
re was
  an accumulation of amino acid (aa) substitutions in the capsid proteins
  throughout the carrier state that could be correlated with alterations in
  antigenicity in virus isolates collected late stage in infection. The aa
  substitutions detected mainly occurred in VP1 and antigenic changes were
  detected in late isolates both at antigenic site 1, resulting in loss of
  binding of Mab 4GO7, and at a closely located site which has not yet been
  named, recognized by Mab C29. In further experiments groups of pigs were
  exposed to a range of SVD viruses, but no virus was isolated beyond 16 da=
ys
  post infection (dpi) nor viral RNA detected beyond 42 dpi. Attempts to tr=
ansfer
  infection to sentinel pigs introduced some time after initial infection o=
f the
  original pigs were largely unsuccessful. The carrier state was establishe=
d in
  only one out of 5 experimental infections of pigs with SVD virus and can
  therefore be considered a rare sequel to infection with SVD virus and is =
of
  limited significance in the epidemiology of the disease.

  chloroquine resistance and therapeutic failure were measured at sentinel =
sites
  and used to calculate age-adjusted genotype-resistance indices (GRIs) and
  genotype-failure indices (GFIs). Treatment outcomes were noted for 1424
  patients between 1997 and 1999. Results revealed stable GRIs and GFIs at
  different sites in Mali, West Africa. This model permits mapping of chlor=

AB: Insecticide-treated bednets and curtains have been shown to be successf=
ul in
  reducing malaria transmission and child mortality in Africa over periods =
of up
  to 2 years. A major concern relating to this approach is that, in time, i=
t will
  be compromised by the selection of mosquito genotypes that are resistant =
at the
  biochemical or behavioural level. We report entomological data from a lar=
ge
  area in Burkina Faso where insecticide-treated curtains have been in use =
for up
  to 5 years. Longitudinal indoor and outdoor CDC light-trap catches were
  performed in 4 sentinel villages. In addition cross-sectional surveys usi=
ng
  indoor spray catches and outdoor CDC light-trap catches were performed ea=
ch
  September in a larger number of villages, including 8 located outside the
  intervention area. We found no evidence of the selection of mosquito phen=
otypes
  that might compromise the intervention. Indoor and outdoor vector densiti=
es
  remained very low after 5 years of intervention, both compared with pre
  -intervention levels and with concurrent levels outside the intervention =
area.
  We found no evidence of a switch to outdoor rather than indoor biting. Th=
e
  proportion of blood meals taken on humans may have decreased but our data=
 are
  inconclusive on this point. We observed higher vector densities and sporo=
zoite
  rates at the periphery of the intervention zone than at the centre, which=
 may
  reflect re-invasion of peripheral villages by mosquitoes from outside the
  intervention area. In 'real life' programmes, with perhaps patchy, less t=
han
  optimal coverage, the protection against malaria transmission provided to
  individuals using insecticide-treated materials may be less than that ach=
ieved
  in the randomized controlled trials which demonstrated an impact of insec=
ticide
  -treated materials on child mortality.

  encephalomyelitis (WEE) and St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) viruses were mon=
itored
  at representative wetland study sites in the Coachella, San Joaquin, and
  Sacramento valleys of California, USA from 1996 to 1998 using three metho=
ds:
  (1) virus isolation from pools of 50 host-seeking Culex tarsalis Coquille=
tt
  females, (2) seroconversions in flocks of 10 sentinel chickens, and (3)
  seroprevalence in wild birds collected by mist nets and grain baited trap=
s.
  Overall, 74 WEE and one SLE isolates were obtained from 222455 C. tarsali=
s
  females tested in 4988 pools. In addition, 133 and 40 seroconversions wer=
e
  detected in 28 chicken flocks, and 143 and 27 of 20192 sera tested from 1=
49
  species of wild birds were positive for antibodies to WEE and SLE,
  respectively. WEE was active in all three valleys, whereas SLE was detect=
ed
  only in Coachella Valley. Seroconversions in sentinel chickens provided t=
he
  most sensitive indication of enzootic activity and were correlated with
  seroprevalence rates in wild birds. Avian seroprevalence rates did not pr=
ovide
  an early warning of pending enzootic activity in chickens, because positi=
ve
  sera from after hatching year birds collected during spring most probably=
 were
  the result of infections acquired during the previous season. Few
  seroconversions were detected among banded recaptured birds collected dur=
ing
  spring and early summer. Age and resident status, but not sex, were signi=
ficant
  risk factors for wild bird infection, with the highest seroprevalence rat=
es
  among after hatching year individuals of permanent resident species. Migr=
ants
  (with the exception of mourning doves) and winter resident species were r=
arely
  positive. House finches (Carpodacus mexicanus), house sparrows (Passer
  domesticus), Gambel's quail (Callipepla gambelii), California quail (C.
  californicus), common ground doves (Columbina passerina), and mourning do=
ves
  (Zenaida macroura) were most frequently positive for antibodies. The init=
ial
  detection of enzootic activity each summer coincided closely with the
  appearance of hatching year birds of these species in our study areas, pe=
rhaps
  indicating their role in virus amplification. Bird species most frequentl=
y
  positive roosted or nested in elevated upland vegetation, sites where C.
  tarsalis host-seeking females hunt most frequently. These serosurveys pro=
vided
  important background information for planned host competence and chronic

AB: Four general frequencies of human St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus
  (epidemic, focal, sporadic), and no transmission occurred in Florida, USA
  between 1990 and 1999. An epidemic with 226 clinical cases and 11 deaths =
was
  reported from 28 Florida counties between July 1990 and January 1991. Dur=
ing
  the autumn of 1993, a focal outbreak was reported from Lee (5 cases) and
  Collier (3) Counties in southwest Florida. During the autumn of 1997, spo=
radic
  transmission to nine humans was reported from five Florida counties (Brev=
ard, 1
  case; Polk, 3; Charlotte, 1; Lee, 2; and Palm Beach, 2). Human infection =
with
  SLE virus depends on a number of variables that drive virus transmission.=
 These
  include vector, virus, and avian host abundance, and meteorological event=
s,
  especially rainfall. We monitored the abundance and serological status of=
 wild
  avian amplification hosts, virus isolations from Culex nigripalpus female=
s, and
  SLE virus transmission to sentinel chickens during 1990, 1993, and 1997. =
The
  epidemic of 1990 was characterized by conditions that produced an unusual
  abundance of vector mosquitoes and avian amplification hosts early in the=
 year.
  We propose that epidemics may result when a specific combination of bioti=
c and
  abiotic conditions favour SLE virus minimum field infection rates that ap=
proach

AB: A preliminary investigation of the dispersal capabilities of mass-reare=
d T.
  ostriniae was carried out in sweetcorn fields in central New York, USA du=
ring
  1997. Results of investigation revealed that showed that T. ostriniae dis=
persed
  up to _115 m within 7 days and continued reproducing and dispersing for u=
p to
  60 days or longer from the release field to younger sweetcorn plants in
  surrounding fields. Studies were then conducted in 2 sweetcorn fields loc=
ated
  in Cayuga County, New York to investigate the within-field dispersal of T=
.
  ostriniae, released at _1 million per field, for control of O. nubilalis,
  inoculated as sentinel egg masses (5 wax paper patches of 4 egg masses ea=
ch)
  onto leaves of 5 neighbouring individual plants. T. ostriniae dispersed a=
t a
  distance of 180 and 230 m from the release point within 6 and 21 days,
  respectively. The relationship between the distance from the release poin=
t and
  both number of T. ostriniae captured on sticky cards and sentinel egg mas=
s
  parasitism was consistently negative. High parasitism levels of sentinel =
egg
  masses, which continued to increase over 14-day periods, were obtained at
  distances in excess of 100 m. However, there was no significant interacti=
on
  between distance and time in all fields. Uniform levels of sentinel egg
  parasitism were observed within 1-2 ha from the central release point,
  indicating that a single release point is critical to ensure uniform disp=
ersal
  of T. ostriniae into sweetcorn fields.

AB: Two experiments were carried out to identify the target population of c=
attle
  for immunization against East Coast fever (ECF) using the infection-and
  -treatment method. Firstly, a sentinel-calf study was used to determine t=
he age
  window for ECF immunisation by determining ages at clinical detection of
  infection with Theileria parva. Six groups of five naive crossbred (Bos
  taurus/Bos indicus) male calves, introduced at intervals of 2 months at a=
 mean
  age of 26 days, were exposed to natural tick challenge on a high ECF-risk=
,
  small-holder farm in the coastal lowland, coconut-cassava agroecological =
zone
  of coastal Kenya. Secondly, a challenge study evaluated the relationship
  between the presence of T. parva antibodies and immunity. Ten indigenous =
adult
  Zebu cattle and nine Zebu young stock purchased from farmers in the same =
zone,
  and eight crossbred calves (survivours of the sentinel-calf study) were
  challenged with ten times the immunizing dose of T. parva Marikebuni stoc=
k.
  Twenty-four of these 27 cattle had high antibody titres before challenge.=
 Two
  crossbred calves, obtained from an ECF-free area and seronegative to T. p=
arva
  schizont antigen, were also challenged and used as susceptible controls. =
Twenty
  -five (83%) of the 30 sentinel calves contracted ECF over an age range of=
 36
  -116 days (mean of 72 days). The remaining five calves died of other caus=
es
  within 2 months of arrival on the farm. Fourteen of the 25 calves survive=
d the
  infection and developed antibodies to T. parva. Despite tick control, sev=
en of
  these 14 calves had a second episode of ECF and two died. Overall, 13 of =
the 25
  calves that contracted ECF died. Only one of 19 indigenous Zebu animals
  developed clinical ECF when challenged with T. parva Marikebuni, displayi=
ng
  mild clinical signs with spontaneous recovery. Of the eight crossbred
  survivours from the first experiment, only one succumbed to ECF when chal=
lenged
  and it died. Both susceptible crossbred calves developed severe clinical =
signs
  of ECF and one died. The experimental studies show that in the high ECF-r=
isk
  areas of the coconut-cassava zone of coastal Kenya, immunization against =
ECF in
  crossbred (B. taurus/B. indicus) cattle should be targeted at an early ag=
e,
  preferably within 1-2 months of birth.

AB: Ixodes spinipalpis maintains Borrelia bissettii spirochaetes in Colorad=
o,
  USA in a cycle involving wood rats and deer mice. This tick has been desc=
ribed
  as nidicolous, remaining either attached to its rodent hosts or in the ro=
dent
  nest. Nidicolous ticks pose little risk of pathogen transmission to human=
s if
  they do not actively quest for hosts. To investigate the questing potenti=
al of
  I. spinipalpis, sentinel mice were placed in an area where I. spinipalpis=
 had
  been commonly found on wood rats and deer mice. Concurrently, wild rodent
  populations were trapped and analysed for Lyme disease spirochaetes, the =
agent
  of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (aoHGE), and Babesia microti. A total =
of 122
  I. spinipalpis larvae and 10 nymphs were found on 19% of 244 sentinel mic=
e. In
  addition, 4 sentinel mice became infested with Malaraeus telchinus or Orc=
hopeas
  neotomae fleas. Questing I. spinipalpis were positively associated with w=
oody
  shrubs and negatively associated with sunny and grassy areas. Four sentin=
el
  mice became infected with aoHGE after having been fed upon only by I.
  spinipalpis larvae. One sentinel mouse became infected with B. bissettii =
after
  having an I. spinipalpis nymph feed on it, and one sentinel mouse became
  coinfected with aoHGE and B. bissettii after it was fed upon by a single =
I.
  spinipalpis nymph. These sentinel mouse conversions suggest the possibili=
ty
  that the aoHGE is transovarially transmitted by I. spinipalpis, and that =
I.
  spinipalpis is capable of simultaneously transmitting B. bissettii and th=
e
  aoHGE. The findings that I. spinipalpis quest away from rodent nests and =
will
  attach to and infect sentinel mice may be of public health importance. It
  suggests the potential transmission of the agents of human granulocytic
  ehrlichiosis and Lyme disease to other hosts by I. spinipalpis, in region=
s of
  the western USA where Ixodes pacificus is not found.

AB: Israel has accumulated extensive information on bluetongue (BT) occurre=
nce
  in sheep flocks and sentinel cattle in various regions of the country for=
 more
  than 30 years. Meteorological parameters had not been independently corre=
lated
  with the occurrence of BT over the entire period. Meteorological paramete=
rs
  preceding years with high prevalence of bluetongue (1975, 1987, 1988 and =
1994)
  (average of 43 sheep flocks affected) were compared with those for years =
with
  little or no BT transmission (1980, 1981, 1983 and 1992). Winters precedi=
ng
  high-BT seasons were significantly warmer; the average maximum temperatur=
e of
  the coldest month was 2 to 3=B0C higher, and the average maximum and mini=
mum
  temperatures were 1-2=B0C higher. After extremely dry and warm winters ov=
er the
  eastern Mediterranean, such as those of 1998 and 1999, single cases of BT
  occurred in 1998 and none in 1999. Rainfall in BT outbreak years was
  approximately normal, whereas winters preceding low-BT seasons were wette=
r (40%
  more rainfall than average in the coldest month and 17% more winter rainf=
all
  overall). BT outbreak years had significantly more winter days with maxim=
um
  temperatures higher than 13 or 18=B0C (in the Innerland and in the Arava =
regions,
  respectively), and more nights with minimum temperatures > 5=B0C. Average=
 maximum
  temperatures below 16.5=B0C for the coldest winter month were associated =
with low
  -BT seasons, while winters with more than 18 days warmer than 18=B0C were
  followed by high BTV transmission. In most parts of Israel except in moun=
tains
  > 700 m above sea level, the average maximum temperature of the coldest w=
inter
  month is > 12.5=B0C, which is thought to enable the survival of BT viruse=
s.
  Mountain areas also have fewer animals/km2 than lowland areas, and more o=
f
  these are BT-resistant ruminants such as goats. Two candidates for "safe =
zones"
  with regard to export of ruminants and their products are proposed: the A=
rava
  Rift Valley and mountains above 700 m. Bluetongue outbreaks are not known=
 in
  these regions. The Arava is assumed to be a particularly low-risk region
  because there are smaller numbers and presumed lower survival of the prin=
cipal
  vector, Culicoides imicola. The Arava Rift Valley is also beyond the Pers=
ian
  Trough air stream, which seems to be connected with the introduction of B=
T
  vectors into Israel. These safe zones might be exploited for export of an=
imals
  and germplasm.

AB: During a large-scale treatment programme for the control of urinary
  schistosomiasis in Niger, rapid assessment indicators were evaluated to
  determine the impact of praziquantel on morbidity and when further treatm=
ent is
  required. In 10 villages from 5 different irrigation areas, the urine of =
all
  children aged 7-15 years was examined macroscopically before mass treatme=
nt and
  3 years after intervention. At the same times, children attending (sentin=
el)
  schools in the villages were subjected to parasitological (oviuria) and
  clinical (macroscopic aspect of urine and microhaematuria) examination, a=
nd
  ultrasonography was used to measure the level of morbidity before treatme=
nt,
  the impact of treatment and changes in prevalence and morbidity during th=
e 3
  years following treatment. Rapid assessment indicators, in particular the
  macroscopic aspect of urine (cloudy versus bloody), clearly reflected the
  development of parasitological and ultrasonographic indicators after trea=
tment
  with praziquantel. Cloudy urine indicated the prevalence of infection, wh=
ile
  bloody urine indicated morbidity due to Schistosoma haematobium. Agreemen=
t
  between the results obtained in the sentinel schools and village children=
 made
  it possible to organize a monitoring system using these rapid assessment
  indicators in an area endemic for S. haematobium.

  specific pathogen free (SPF) pigs without maternally derived antibodies h=
as
  repeatedly been shown to be significantly below 1 under experimental
  conditions, R in vaccinated conventional pigs with maternally derived

de the
  difference in husbandry conditions as a cause for this discrepancy, the
  transmission of PRV in 2 groups of 10 maternally immune conventional pigs=
 and 2
  groups of 10 seronegative SPF pigs was quantified and compared under iden=
tical
  experimental conditions. Whereas none of the SPF sentinel pigs became inf=
ected
  (R=3D0, significantly < 1), all conventional sentinel pigs did become inf=
ected
  (R=3D2.5, significantly > 1). Moreover, only one SPF pig shed the virus i=
n
  saliva, the mean cumulative titre being almost 100-fold less than that in
  conventional pigs (17 pigs, P=3D0.003). In addition, the mean proliferati=
on of
  peripheral blood lymphocytes in response to PRV antigens was significantl=
y
  higher in SPF pigs compared with conventional pigs at all points studied =
(P <
  0.0001). And the virus-neutralising antibody titre after vaccination was
  significantly higher in SPF pigs than in conventional pigs. It was conclu=
ded
  that the discrepancy in transmission between vaccinated SPF pigs and vacc=
inated
  conventional pigs cannot be attributed to the experimental conditions.

  fallowing would effectively reduce the Infectious haematopoietic necrosis=
 (IHN)
  load around sites in an area where every mariculture site had a history o=
f IHN.
  The approach involved re-introducing fish to a few strategically placed
  (sentinel) sites and monitoring them for the presence of the virus over a
  specified period. Eighteen site visits and 217 viral plaque assays were c=
arried
  out. No IHN virus was detected in the morts collected during the site vis=
its,
  nor were there any positive reports from the passive surveillance system.=
 Blood
  samples collected at the end of the grow-out period, indicated that the f=
ish
  from one of tha sites had antibodies to IHN virus at the tome of harvest.
  Infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus was detected on this site ten mo=
nths
  after fish were transferred to the site.

  that a virus isolated from the blood plasma of sentinel calves in Japan i=
n late
  September 1999 belongs to the family Bunyaviridae. In an indirect
  immunofluorescence antibody test, the virus cross-reacted with antibodies=
 to
  Akabane and Aino viruses. It also reacted in dot immuno-binding assays us=
ing
  monoclonal antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein of the Akabane virus.
  However, in reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions, the virus w=
as
  shown to be distinct from 10 viruses belonging to the Simbu group of the =
genus
  Bunyavirus. From September to November 1999, seroconversion of sentinel c=
alves
  to the virus occurred on 50.0% of farms and in 35.3% of cattle in Okayama
  Prefecture. The rates were higher in the southern part of the prefecture:=
 100%
  of farms and 83.3% of calves. A retrospective survey showed that no antib=
odies
  to the virus were detected in sera collected from sentinel calves in Okay=
ama
  Prefecture from 1995 to 1998. These results suggest recent emergence of t=

AB: A case-control study was carried out to determine whether residential
  exposure to environmental pollutants increased risk for canine lymphoma i=
n pet
  dogs (Italy). One hundred and one cases with cytologically or histologica=
lly
  confirmed lymphoma diagnosed at a veterinary teaching hospital between th=
e
  middle of 1996 and the middle of 1998 were examined. Controls were obtain=
ed by
  choosing twice the number of dogs without neoplastic disease, with overla=
pping
  distributions of province of residence, age, sex, and breed. Information
  regarding animal management, residence type, professional or hobby use of
  chemicals by owners, and treatment with herbicides or other pesticides in=
 the
  area frequently visited by the dogs was obtained with a multiple choice
  questionnaire by telephone interview. Two variables were positively and
  independently associated with the disease, namely residency in industrial=
 areas
  (odds ratio (OR)=3D8.5; 95% confidence interval (CI)=3D2.3-30.9) and use =
of
  chemicals by owners, specifically paints or solvents (OR=3D4.6; 95% CI=3D=
1.7-12.6).
  A significantly lower value of the mean age of disease onset was found in=
 the
  group of dogs at risk in comparison with the group of all other dogs (6.1=
=B10.4
  years, n=3D36 vs. 7.5=B10.4 years, n=3D65, respectively; P=3D0.008). Vari=
ables
  describing animal care and pesticide use were either not associated with =
the
  disease or were uninformative. It is suggested that canine lymphoma may b=
e
  considered to be a sentinel of potentially hazardous situations for human=
s,
  because of the relatively short latency between exposure and disease onse=
t.

  Zanzibar, was monitored every two to five months in 1994-97 to observe ch=
anges
  in disease transmission attributable logically to the application of
  insecticides, the release of sterilized tsetse flies (Glossina austeni) a=
nd the
  consequent decline and eradication of the wild tsetse population. Two
  parasitological techniques (microhaematocrit centrifugation and buffy coa=
t)
  were used to monitor the incidence of disease caused by Trypanosoma congo=
lense
  and T. vivax. T. congolense and T. vivax were detected in 1994 and 1995, =
but
  only T. vivax was detected thereafter. By 1997, the incidence of bovine
  trypanosomiasis was only 0.1%. There was evidently no increase in disease
  incidence due to the release of sterilized isometamidium chloride-treated=
 male
  tsetse flies.

AB: In Oshima, the southern part of Hokkaido, Japan, a 37-year-old woman wh=
o
  developed a sudden febrile illness was diagnosed with tick-borne encephal=
itis
  (TBE) in 1993. In addition, TBE virus was isolated from the blood samples=
 of
  sentinel dogs, ticks' pools, and rodents spleens in 1995 and 1996 by suck=
ling
  mice. To identify when these TBE viruses emerged in Hokkaido, the times o=
f
  divergence of TBE virus strains isolated in Oshima and Far Eastern Russia=
 were
  estimated. TBE virus was isolated in Khabarovsk in 1998, and the nucleoti=
de
  sequences of viral envelope protein genes of isolates from Oshima and
  Khabarovsk were compared. Based on the synonymous substitution rates of t=
hese
  virus E-protein genes, the lineage-divergence times of these TBE virus st=
rains
  were predicted phylogenetically to be approximately 260-430 years ago.
  Furthermore, the virulence of TBE virus isolates from Oshima and Khabarov=
sk
  were compared in a mouse model. The results showed that the isolates poss=
essed
  very similar virulence in mice. European TBE vaccine was found to be effe=
ctive
  in TBE virus, Hokkaido strain. This review provides evidence that the Osh=
ima
  strains of TBE virus in Hokkaido emerged from the Far Eastern Russia a fe=
w
  hundred years ago, which explains why the virulence of these strains is s=
imilar
  to that of TBE viruses isolated in Russia. Practical application of the v=
accine
  should be considered in Japan.

and
  control (0.2=B10.16 mg/dl, P < 0.0001) mice. In addition, lesions consist=
ent with
  severe chronic nephropathy and mild gastritis were common in GD, compared=
 with
  NGD and control mice. Finally, serum amidated gastrin concentration was
  significantly high in GD (179.37=B153.86 pM, P < 0.03) and NGD (264.89=B1=
115.89 pM,

AB: Myxobolus cerebralis, the myxozoan parasite causing whirling disease in
  salmonids, was first detected in northeastern Oregon in 1986. To better
  understand the potential impact of M. cerebralis on resident and anadromo=
us
  salmonids in this region, a series of studies was conducted in the Lostin=
e
  River, where infected fish were first reported. Rainbow trout Oncorhynchu=
s
  mykiss fry were exposed in sentinel cages for 14 d at five sites from nea=
r the
  river's mouth to the headwaters during the period from July 1998 to Novem=
ber
  1999. A subsample of exposed fry was assayed for the presence of DNA of M=
.
  cerebralis by polymerase chain reaction. Following four exposures, fish w=
ere
  held in the laboratory for 5 months of observation. The severity of infec=
tion
  in these fish was determined by histological examination, enumeration of =
spores
  isolated from the cranial cartilage, and observation of clinical signs.
  Sentinel fry became infected throughout the river from March to November,
  although the prevalence of infection increased in groups exposed in late
  summer. Infection prevalence was highest among fish exposed at the lower =
river
  site, ranging from 22.2% to 100%. Among fish held for 5 months, only thos=
e
  exposed in the lower river developed cranial lesions, whirling behaviour,=
 and
  black tail. The parasite's oligochaete host Tubifex tubifex was consisten=
tly
  identified only from the lower river site. Of the water quality measureme=
nts
  taken at each location, only conductivity correlated with infection preva=
lence
  (P < 0.001). These data indicate that juvenile rainbow trout, steelhead (=
the
  anadromous form of rainbow trout), and chinook salmon O. tshawytscha, whi=
ch
  emerge during times of peak infection, are exposed to M. cerebralis and a=
re
  likely to become infected in this river.

AB: Mechanisms for monitoring Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) virus activi=
ty
  include surveillance of human cases, surveillance for activity in sentine=
l
  animals, monitoring of mosquito vectors and monitoring of weather conditi=
ons.
  The monitoring of human cases is only one possible trigger for public hea=
lth
  action and the additional surveillance systems are used in concert to sig=
nal
  the risk of human disease, often before the appearance of human cases. Mo=
squito
  vector surveillance includes mosquito trapping for speciation and enumera=
tion
  of mosquitoes to monitor population sizes and relative composition. Virus
  isolation from mosquitoes can also be undertaken. Monitoring of weather
  conditions and vector surveillance determines whether there is a potentia=
l for
  MVE activity to occur. Virus isolation from trapped mosquitoes is necessa=
ry to
  define whether MVE is actually present, but is difficult to deliver in a =
timely
  fashion in some jurisdictions. Monitoring of sentinel animals indicates w=
hether
  MVE transmission to vertebrates is actually occurring. Meteorological
  surveillance can assist in the prediction of potential MVE virus activity=
 by
  signalling conditions that have been associated with outbreaks of Murray =
Valley
  encephalitis in humans in the past. Predictive models of MVE virus activi=
ty for
  south-eastern Australia have been developed, but due to the infrequency o=
f
  outbreaks, are yet to be demonstrated as useful for the forecasting of ma=
jor
  outbreaks. Surveillance mechanisms vary across the jurisdictions. Surveil=
lance
  of human disease occurs in all States and Territories by reporting of cas=
es to
  health authorities. Sentinel flocks of chickens are maintained in 4
  jurisdictions (Western Australia, the Northern Territory, Victoria and Ne=
w
  South Wales) with collaborations between Western Australia and the Northe=
rn
  Territory. Mosquito monitoring complements the surveillance of sentinel a=
nimals
  in these jurisdictions. In addition, other mosquito monitoring programmes=
 exist
  in other States (including South Australia and Queensland). Public health
  control measures may include advice to the general public and mosquito
  management programmes to reduce the numbers of both mosquito larvae and a=
dult
  vectors. Strategic plans for public health action in the event of MVE vir=
us
  activity are currently developed or being developed in New South Wales, t=
he
  Northern Territory, South Australia, Western Australia and Victoria. A so=
uthern
  tri-State agreement exists between health departments of New South Wales,
  Victoria and South Australia and the Commonwealth Department of Health an=
d Aged
  Care. All partners have agreed to co-operate and provide assistance in
  predicting and combatting outbreaks of mosquito-borne disease in south-ea=
stern
  Australia. The newly formed National Arbovirus Advisory Committee is a wo=
rking
  party providing advice to the Communicable Diseases Network Australia on
  arbovirus surveillance and control. Recommendations for further enhanceme=

AB: The presence of environmental contaminants in air, water and food may p=
ose
  significant health risks to the exposed human population. However, proble=
ms
  associated with assessing chronic exposure to low doses of environmental
  chemicals, multiple exposure routes, diseases with long latency periods, =
and
  non-specific health outcomes make it difficult to conduct the appropriate=
 human
  epidemiological studies. It may be useful to complement human epidemiolog=
y with
  animal studies. Animals monitored or evaluated in situ for the appropriat=
e
  suite of endpoints can provide information about both exposure levels and
  potential adverse health effects. Animals have served as sentinel indicat=
ors
  for health effects associated with a number of environmental exposures,
  including pesticides and asbestos. Pet dogs may be particularly valuable
  sentinels because they share the human environment. In addition, dogs res=
pond
  to many toxic insults in ways analogous to humans, they have physiologica=
lly
  compressed life spans, and they are free from some important lifestyle ri=
sk
  factors for disease. An example of how pet dogs may be used as sentinels =
for
  potential human health hazards involves a study of the genotoxic effects
  resulting from exposure to a mixture of chemicals from nearby Superfund s=
ites.
  We conducted a cross-sectional study of exposed dogs (living in the commu=
nity
  with the Superfund sites) and controls (living in a nearby community). Th=
e pet
  owners completed a questionnaire, and we collected a blood sample from ea=
ch
  dog. The blood samples were analysed for standard clinical parameters and
  assays for possible genotoxic effects (peripheral blood lymphocyte micron=
ucleus
  frequency and lymphocyte subtyping). Pet dogs living near the Superfund s=
ites
  had a higher micronucleus frequency than control animals, suggesting that=
 the
  dogs may have been exposed to environmental contaminants from these sites=

AB: The Department of Defense (DoD) has a unique marine mammal program
  maintained by the US Navy that includes the largest force of bottlenose
  dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, worldwide. In recent years, this population=
 of
  cetaceans that lives in netted open water enclosures in San Diego Bay has=
 been
  monitored for levels of organochlorine (OC) contaminants in blubber, bloo=
d and
  milk. Data generated from these studies have afforded insight into the fa=
te and
  possible effects of OC contaminants in marine mammals. We now report
  preliminary findings on the effects of maternal OC exposure on pregnancy
  outcome. Blubber OC levels were compared between females whose calves sur=
vived
  beyond 6 months and females whose calves were stillborn or died within 12=
 days
  of birth. The mean concentration of SIGMADDT was > 3 times as high among
  dolphins whose calves died as that among dolphins whose calves survived b=
eyond
  6 months (P=3D0.002). Mean SIGMAPCB was > 2.5 times higher in females who=
se
  calves did not survive (P=3D0.076). This population is a logical sentinel=
 for the
  assessment of environmentally mediated disease. Biological tissues and fl=
uids
  can be sampled on a regular basis from the dolphins for accumulation of t=
issue
  residues, facilitated by conditioned husbandry behaviors. These trained
  behaviours help preclude possible alterations in health measures resultin=
g from
  capture stress. Animals' diets can be monitored for contaminant levels. W=
ith
  these data, the expertise and facilities available at the Navy laboratory=
 and
  in collaboration with other experts in the field, controlled studies can =
be
  designed to monitor and assess dietary exposure, measurable immune and
  neurological responses and assess reproductive and transgenerational effe=
cts of
  contaminants. Biomarkers can be developed to relate the health of individ=
ual
  animals relative to contaminant exposures. Such investigations of natural
  exposure and response scenarios are a logical adjunct to traditional labo=
ratory
  toxicity studies.

AB: From the fall of 1992 through the season of calving in 1996, detailed c=

  breeding outcome records were maintained actively for seven large cow-cal=
f
  herds in western Canada. The numbers of mature females in the study for t=
he
  breeding seasons beginning in 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995 were 1122, 1177,=
 1251,
  and 1236, respectively. Outcomes included pregnancy status, calving inter=
val,
  and the occurrence of twins, abortions, stillbirths, and neonatal mortali=
ty.
  Information on other risk factors known to influence beef-herd health and
  productivity was also collected. Detailed maps of active and inactive oil=
 and
  natural-gas sites, batteries, compressor stations and processing plants w=
ere
  verified. Records of flaring activity at each facility were obtained from=
 the
  government regulatory agency. Each flaring site was then classified as so=
ur or
  sweet based on the presence or absence of hydrogen sulfide in the flared =
gas. A
  detailed inventory was prepared itemizing the type and number of faciliti=
es
  within 1.6 km (1 mile) of the centre of each quarter section used for pas=
ture.
  The total volume of gas flared within 1.6 km of the centre of each pastur=
e was
  determined for each month of the study. Appropriate risk periods where
  specified for each outcome and a cumulative exposure calculated for each
  breeding female (using detailed individual animal records of cow movement=
s
  between pastures and herd-management groups). Generalized estimation equa=
tions
  were used to evaluate the association between exposure and outcome, and t=
o
  adjust for potential confounders and clustering of binomial outcomes with=
in
  herd. Increased risk of non-pregnancy was sometimes associated with expos=
ure to
  one or more of the following facility types: sour-gas flaring battery
  facilities, all battery-flaring sites, active gas wells, and larger field
  facilities. The associations were not, however, consistent among years or=
 even
  among risk periods for the same year. Facility proximity and flaring were=
 not
  associated with increased abortion risk. Volume of flared sour gas from b=
attery
  sites was associated with increased risk of stillbirth. Finally, sour-gas

AB: Beef cows are sometimes pastured close to oil- and gas-production and
  processing facilities. In the following study, the health and productivit=
y of
  cow-calf herds with differing exposure to sour-natural-gas processing
  facilities in western Canada were measured. In seven cow-calf herds, the
  numbers of eligible mature females included in the study for the breeding
  seasons beginning in 1993, 1994 and 1995 were 1177, 1251 and 1236,
  respectively. Outcomes included pregnancy status, calving interval, and t=
he
  occurrence of twins, abortions, stillbirths, and neonatal mortality.
  Information also was collected on other risk factors known to influence b=
eef
  -herd health and productivity. Monthly measurements from a network of pas=
sive
  air-monitoring devices were used to estimate exposure. Total sulfation an=
d H2S
  deposition were used as markers for the complex mixture of compounds foun=
d in
  emissions from sour-gas processing plants and sour flares. Most herds wer=
e
  managed in multiple pasture groups. Cumulative exposure assessments were =
made
  from records of individual-animal movements between pastures. Generalized
  estimation equations were used to evaluate the association between exposu=
re and
  outcome, and to adjust for potential confounders and clustering of binomi=
al
  outcomes within herd. No consistent associations were found between eithe=
r
  total sulfation or H2S deposition and productivity parameters across the =
cow
  -calf production cycles. There were, however, five examples of significan=
t
  associations between increasing cumulative exposure to total sulfation an=
d
  decreased productivity in the 18 models examined.

AB: Between 1978 and 1988 Plasmodium falciparum resistance to chloroquine h=
as
  been reported in all countries of tropical Africa. Despite the intensific=

  -line treatment for malaria in most of these countries. Here we review
  published data on the public health impact of antimalarial drug resistanc=
e in
  Africa. These data show that since the late 1980s convincing evidence of =
a
  major public health impact of the spread of chloroquine resistance has be=
en
  available. Hospital studies in various African countries have documented =
a 2-
  or 3-fold increase in malaria deaths and admissions for severe malaria, a=
n
  increase temporally related to the emergence of chloroquine resistance. D=
ata
  from sentinel demographic surveillance systems in Senegal indicated that
  mortality attributable to malaria in children increased by as much as 6-f=
old
  among populations where low levels of malaria mortality had been achieved
  because of efficient health services before the emergence of chloroquine
  resistance. Increasing incidence of severe malarial anaemia also contribu=
ted to
  human immunodeficiency virus dissemination. The dramatic impact of chloro=
quine
  resistance on malaria mortality has long been underestimated because only=
 a low
  proportion of malaria attacks are potentially lethal among persons contin=
uously
  exposed since birth to high levels of transmission. There is an urgent ne=
ed to
  change treatment policies in Africa.

AB: During 1997-98, we investigated the possible continuous circulation of
  epizootic Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus suggested by a 1983
  subtype IC interepizootic mosquito isolate made in Panaquire, Miranda Sta=
te,
  Venezuela. The study area was originally covered by lowland tropical rain=
forest
  but has been converted into cacao plantations. Sentinel hamsters, small m=
ammal
  trapping, mosquito collections, and human serosurveys were used to detect
  active or recent virus circulation. Six strains of subtype ID VEE virus w=
ere
  isolated from hamsters that displayed no apparent disease. Four other
  arboviruses belonging to group A (Togaviridae: Alphavirus), two Bunyamwer=
a
  group (Bunyaviridae), and three Gamboa group (Bunyaviridae) arboviruses w=
ere
  also isolated from hamsters, as well as 8 unidentified viruses. Venezuela=
n
  equine encephalitis-specific antibodies were detected in 5 small mammal
  species: Proechimys guairae, Marmosa spp., and Didelphis marsupialis. Mos=
quito
  collections comprised of 38 different species, including 8 members of the
  subgenus Culex, did not yield any virus isolates. Sera from 195 humans, e=
ither
  workers in the cacao plantation or nearby residents, were all negative fo=
r VEE
  virus antibodies. Sequences of 1677 nucleotides from the P62 gene of 2 vi=
rus
  isolates indicated that they represent a subtype ID lineage that is disti=
nct
  from all others characterized previously, and are unrelated to epizootic =
VEE
  emergence. The VEE virus sequences are deposited in the GenBank library u=

  accession numbers AF348335 and AF348336.

TI: What do sentinels stand for?
AU: Beeby-A

SO: Environmental-Pollution. 2001, 112: 2, 285-298; 71 ref.
PY: 2001
LA: English
AB: Sentinel species are biological monitors that accumulate a pollutant in
  their tissues without significant adverse effects. Primarily used to meas=
ure
  the amount of a pollutant that is biologically available, they may also
  increase the sensitivity of an analytical procedure or summarize a comple=
x
  pollution signal. This paper examines the validation of sentinels, referr=
ing
  particularly to the use of invertebrates in monitoring toxic metal pollut=
ion in
  terrestrial ecosystems. Few studies measure the capacity of a sentinel to
  quantify changes in ambient levels. Definitions of bioavailability also d=
iffer
  between workers and few note that this may be a highly species-specific
  measure. Validation requires that the temporal and spatial scales over wh=
ich a
  sentinel integrates a pollution signal are known. The sentinel has to be
  calibrated against source concentrations and this relationship shown to b=
e
  consistent over the normal range of exposure. This requires some consider=
ation
  of the environmental and biological determinants of pollutant assimilatio=
n.
  Differences between populations can confound simple comparisons between s=
ites
  based on native populations. Transplanted individuals, matched for age, s=
ex and
  physiological state might be used when the aim is not to assess bioavaila=
bility
  to the resident population. A simple measure of their capacity to detect
  differences in ambient pollutant levels is proposed to evaluate candidate
  species, to assess their consistency and capacity to equilibrate with the=
ir
  source. A small survey of earthworms from a well-defined gradient of Pb
  pollution is used to illustrate problems of interpreting tissue concentra=
tions
  in sentinels.

  virus (CSFV) in an eradication programme. In four animal experiments with
  different vaccination-challenge intervals we determined the duration of
  protection of an E2 subunit marker vaccine in pigs after a single vaccina=
tion.
  Unvaccinated pigs were included in each group to detect transmission of t=
he
  challenge virus. Three groups of 6 pigs were vaccinated once and subseque=
ntly
  inoculated with the virulent CSFV strain Brescia after a vaccination-chal=
lenge
  interval of 3, 51/2, 6 or 13 months. All vaccinated pigs, 16 out of 18, w=
ith
  neutralizing antibodies against CSFV at the moment of challenge, 3, 51/2,=
 6 or
  13 months later, survived, whereas unvaccinated control pigs died from ac=
ute
  CSF or were killed being moribund. A proportion of the vaccinated pigs di=
d
  however develop fever or cytopenia after challenge and two vaccinated pig=
s were
  viremic after challenge. Virus transmission of vaccinated and challenged =
pigs
  to unvaccinated sentinel pigs did not occur in groups of pigs which were
  challenged 3 or 6 months after a single vaccination. Two out of eight
  vaccinated pigs that were found negative for CSFV neutralizing antibody a=
t 13
  months after vaccination died after subsequent challenge. The findings in=
 this
  study demonstrate that pigs can be protected against a lethal challenge o=
f CSFV
  for up to 13 months after a single vaccination with an E2 subunit marker
  vaccine.

AB: Northern fowl mites (Ornithonyssus sylviarum) were monitored on a caged
  -layer operation in southern California, USA for 22 months. Three experie=
nced
  observers underestimated actual numbers of mites in the vent region _80% =
of the
  time. Errors were higher for heavy infestations. Observer estimates were =
highly
  correlated with each other (r > 0.89, P < 0.01) and with mite numbers est=
imated
  by vent feather removal (r > 0.82, P < 0.01). Mites on hens varied betwee=
n
  houses and over time. Moulting consistently reduced mite numbers, but did=
 not
  eliminate them in a flock. Long-term monitoring of individual sentinel he=
ns
  demonstrated that some hens would support high numbers of mites for sever=
al
  months or more. Use of a new sequential hen sampling plan required _1 min=
 per
  hen, if mite numbers were estimated. At this site, treatment decisions of=
ten
  could be reached in < 20 min per house. Mite scores (index of estimated m=
ites
  per hen) were well correlated with percentage of hens infested in both te=
st
  houses. In a chronically infested house, prevalence of mites on eggs aver=
aged
  8.5%, with a range of 0-55%. Applications of tetrachlorvinphos-dichlorvos=
 by
  the producer appeared to be based on mites on > about 20% of eggs. The ch=
emical
  was marginal for controlling mites on hens (25% reduction in percentage o=
f hens
  infested), but effectively reduced mites on eggs (95% fewer mites on eggs=
 at 1
  week and 90% at 2 weeks). When data were grouped by mite index score on h=
ens,
  there was a strong relationship (r2 =3D 0.83, P < 0.01) between mite prev=
alence
  on eggs and the scores of the hens which laid them. Sampling 100 eggs eve=
nly
  spaced in a house required < 7 min, and adult mites were easily seen. Sam=
pling
  mites on eggs appears to be useful to localize at least high level
  infestations, and egg-based sampling for mites merits further investigati=
on.

AB: New techniques are presented on the use of 15N to mark insects. 15N, a
  stable isotope of nitrogen, was enriched above natural abundance in plant=
 and
  insect tissues. Two laboratory studies demonstrated that enriched 15N
  -concentrations could be tracked from plant to insect using mass spectrom=
etry.
  In the first study, adult Cotesia plutellae and Hippodamia convergens wer=
e
  allowed to feed at the flowers of rapid-cycling Chinese cabbage (Brassica=
 rapa
  subsp. pekinensis [B. pekinensis]) plants that had been fertilized with 1=
5N
  -enriched potassium nitrate (KNO3-15NO3). Both insect groups were found t=
o have
  significantly elevated 15N levels after visiting the flowers of the 15N
  -enriched plants for 48 hours. In the second study, 15N-enriched bean pla=
nt
  (Phaseolus vulgaris) tissue was incorporated into an insect diet and fed =
to
  navel orangeworms, Amyelois transitella. When the navel orangeworm larvae=
 were
  fourth instars, they were removed from the diet and exposed to the parasi=
toid,
  Goniozus legneri. Results indicated that the enriched 15N-concentration o=
f the
  bean plants was transferred to the navel orangeworms and, subsequently, t=
o the
  parasitoids. This work may provide useful techniques to help establish wh=
ether
  agriculturally important entomophaga visiting 15N-enriched flowers or
  parasitizing enriched sentinel larvae in the field can be effectively mar=
ked
  with 15N.

AB: Monocrotophos is the single largest selling agrochemical in India. Sens=

  Tilapia mossambica [Oreochromis mossambicus], which are edible, commercia=

to
  study DNA strand breaks induced by monocrotophos in T. mossambica in vivo=
 using
  single-cell micro gel electrophoresis/comet assay. Tilapia were treated o=
rally
  with 0.313, 0.625, 1.25, 1.875, 2.5, 3.125, 3.75 and 4.375 ppm of monocro=
tophos
  and the assay was performed on nucleated erythrocytes after 24, 48, 72 an=
d 96
  h. A significant increase in mean comet tail-length (5.21-7.46 =B5M), ind=
icating
  DNA damage, was observed at all the doses with monocrotophos when compare=
d to
  controls (3.36 =B5M). The mean tail-length showed a dose-related increase=
 and
  time-dependent decrease. The maximum increase in mean comet tail-length w=
as
  observed at 24 h. Relative to these effects, reductions in mean comet tai=
l
  -length were seen at 48 and 72 h. By 96 h, values had returned to control
  levels at all doses, indicating repair of the damaged DNA and/or loss of
  heavily damaged cells. The study reveals that the comet assay is a sensit=
ive
  and rapid method to detect genotoxicity of monocrotophos and other
  environmental pollutants in sentinel species.

AB: The core Zambian system for epidemiological surveillance and research h=
as
  two major components: (i) HIV sentinel surveillance at selected antenatal
  clinics (ANC) in all provinces; and (ii) population based HIV surveys in
  selected sentinel populations (1996 and 1999). The former was refined in =
1994
  to improve the monitoring of prevalence trends, whereas the latter was de=
signed
  to validate ANC-based data, to study change in prevalence and behaviour
  concomitantly and to assess demographic impacts. Data from these surveill=
ance
  systems were used to examine trends in HIV prevalence and behaviours in Z=
ambia
  during the 1990s. The ANC-based data showed a dominant trend of significa=
nt
  declines in HIV prevalence in the 15-19 years age group and also in age g=
roup
  20-24 years in urban sites. When rates were adjusted for over-representat=
ion of
  women with low education, a similar declining trend was also observed. In=
 the
  general population, prevalence declined significantly in urban women aged=
 15-29
  years, whereas it showed a tendency to decline among rural women aged 15-=
24
  years. Prominent decline in prevalence was associated with higher educati=
on,
  stable or rising prevalence with low education. There was evidence in urb=
an
  populations of increased condom use, decline in multiple sexual partners =
and,
  among younger women, delayed age at first birth. These results suggest a
  dominant declining trend in HIV prevalence that corresponds to declines i=
n
  incidence since the early 1990s attributable to behavioural changes. Effo=
rts to
  sustain the ongoing process of change in the well-educated segments of th=
e
  population should not be undervalued, but the modest change in behaviour
  identified among the most deprived groups represents the major preventive
  challenge.

AB: A small scale transmission experiment was performed with bovine herpesv=
irus
  1 (BHV1) in a cattle population under field conditions. 10 calves were ho=
used
  under strict hygienic conditions, with a distance of 4 m between each cal=
f.
  Five calves were experimentally infected with BHV1, two calves with strai=
n
  Harberink and three with strain Lam, respectively. Experimentally infecte=
d
  calves were placed at 4 m distance from five susceptible sentinel calves.
  Airborne transmission to sentinel calves was detected using virus isolati=
on and
  BHV1 specific polymerase chain reactions in samples of nasal fluids, and =
BHV1
  specific antibodies in serum samples. Strain Harberink was hardly transmi=
tted
  to sentinel calves, whereas strain Lam was transmitted to all sentinels.
  Estimating the rate of transmission per day, the total number of calves
  infected by one (strain Lam) infected calf was 1.18. Comparing this estim=
ated
  transmission ratio between cattle at a distance of 4 m to the estimated
  transmission ratio R of BHV1 in susceptible commingled cattle reported be=
fore,
  the effect of the factor distance on the transmission ratio could be
  calculated. Extrapolating these results, a distance of 4.4 m between catt=

  populations would be necessary to reduce transmission for this strain to =
R < 1.

AB: Specially manufactured low-fat and non-fat foods have become increasing=
ly
  available over the past 2 decades and controversy has surrounded the issu=
e of
  whether these products have beneficial or adverse effects on the health a=

  nutritional status of Americans. This study examines the association of o=
lestra
  consumption with changes in dietary intakes of energy, fat, and cholester=
ol and
  changes in weight and serum lipid concentrations. Data are from a cohort =
of 335
  participants interviewed between September 1996 and January 1997 in the O=
lestra
  Post-Marketing Surveillance Study sentinel site in Marion County (Indiana=
polis,
  Indiana, USA). Diet, weight, and serum lipid levels were assessed before =
the
  market release of olestra and 1 year later, after olestra-containing food=
s were
  widely available. Olestra intake at the 1-year follow-up was categorized =
as
  none, low ( > 0 to 0.4 g/day), moderate (0.4 to 2.0 g/day), and heavy ( >=
 2.0
  g/day). Participants in the heavy olestra consumption category significan=
tly
  reduced dietary intake of percentage of energy from fat (2.7 percentage p=
oints,
  P for trend, 0.003) and saturated fat (1.1 percentage points, P for trend=
,
  0.02). Consumers in the highest category of olestra consumption had
  statistically significantly reduced total serum cholesterol levels of -0.=
54
  mmol/litre (-21 mg/dL) compared with -0.14 mmol/litre (-5 mg/dL) among ol=
estra
  nonconsumers (P for trend, 0.03). These results indicate that introductio=
n of a
  new fat substitute (olestra) in the US market was associated with healthf=
ul
  changes in dietary fat intake and serum cholesterol concentrations among
  consumers who chose to consume olestra-containing foods.

  test), which causes a pruritic rash in people infected with Onchocerca
  volvulus, was evaluated in 1996-99 as a method to detect patent infection=
 in
  children and adolescents born since the advent of successful control (a
  sentinel population for the detection of recrudescence). In an analysis o=
f 1887
  individuals in Cote d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso, the DEC-patch test produce=
d
  prevalence estimates comparable to those obtained by skin snip. Its sensi=
tivity
  compared to the skin snip test varied from 56% to 80% depending on the lo=
cation
  and the time between application and observation, and its specificity var=
ied
  between 80% and 95%; however, the sensitivity of the skin snip test is kn=
own to
  be quite low. The sensitivity was marginally greater in children and
  adolescents than in adults, and was greater in individuals who had receiv=

  prior MectizanTM (ivermectin) treatment. These data suggest that the DEC-=

ions,
  bioindicators can be used to assess the health of aquatic ecosystems whic=
h may
  be compromised by a variety of environmental stressors such as contaminan=
ts,
  sediments, nutrients, and varying temperature, salinity, and hydrologic
  regimes. The bioindicators approach is a proven bioassessment method that=
 uses
  responses of key (sentinel) aquatic organisms both as integrators of stre=
ss
  effects and as sensitive response (early-warning) indicators of environme=
ntal
  health. This integrated approach involves measuring a suite of selected
  biological and ecological responses at several levels of biological
  organization from the biomolecular and biochemical to the community level=
s.
  When properly designed and applied in field situations, bioindicator stud=
ies
  can help identify causal mechanisms between environmental stressors and
  population and community-level effects, and serve as a basis for which th=
e
  effectiveness of remedial actions on the health of aquatic organisms can =
be
  evaluated. Rapidly-responding sensitive biomarkers, such as biomolecular =
and
  biochemical responses, and slower-response ecologically relevant bioindic=
ators,
  such as population and community responses, can be included in field
  bioassessment programs to provide measurement endpoints for use in
  environmental compliance, regulatory decision-making, and ecological risk
  assessments. This bioindicators approach should be particularly relevant =
in
  helping to identify and diagnose sources of stressors in environments imp=
acted
  by multiple stressors. To demonstrate use of bioindicators in addressing =
water
  quality issues, spatial and temporal patterns in various biological respo=
nses
  are related to spatial and temporal patterns of contaminants in two aquat=
ic
  systems compromised by different stressors.

AB: A tsetse and bovine trypanosomosis survey was conducted during 1998 and=
 1999
  in the Matutuine District of Maputo Province (Mozambique). A total of 59
  Glossina brevipalpis and 17 Glossina austeni were captured throughout the
  district. Survey results suggest that Glossina brevipalpis is mainly
  concentrated in dense vegetation along the Maputo River and in the wetlan=
ds
  east of the river. G. austeni was captured mainly in dense thickets in dr=
ier
  areas. Both tsetse species are suspected to be vectors of bovine
  trypanosomosis. Bovine trypanosomosis (75.5% Trypanosoma congolense) was
  diagnosed in 53 animals (13.9%) from seven sampling sites distributed
  throughout the district. The prevalence of cattle with anti-trypanosomal
  antibodies was high (29.9%). The incidence of trypanosomal infections in
  sentinel cattle was also high. The widespread distribution of bovine
  trypanosomosis and the high prevalence of infection are likely to have a
  significant impact on cattle production and, hence, the cattle restocking
  exercise in the district.

AB: Detection of mouse parvovirus 1 (MPV) depends on use of serological and
  polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. These assays were evaluated for t=
heir
  ability to detect virus-specific antibodies or viral DNA in multiple stra=
ins
  and ages of mice inoculated with MPV. Twelve-week-old ICR, BALB/c, C3H,
  C57BL/6, and DBA/2 mice and four- and eight-week-old ICR mice were inocul=
ated
  with MPV. Serum was harvested four weeks after inoculation and analysed b=
y use
  of recombinant non-structural protein 1 (rNS1) enzyme-linked immunosorben=
t
  assay (ELISA), minute virus of mice (MVM) ELISA, and MPV indirect fluores=
cent
  antibody (IFA), MVM IFA, and MPV haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay=
s.
  Select tissues were harvested and analysed by use of an MPV-specific PCR =
assay.
  The number of mice in each group with detectable MPV-specific antibodies =
or MPV
  DNA varied with mouse strain, mouse age when inoculated, and viral dose.
  Seroconversion in mice inoculated at 12 weeks of age was detected almost
  exclusively by use of the MPV IFA and MPV HAI assays, whereas seroconvers=
ion in
  almost all mice inoculated at 4 and 8 weeks of age was detected by use of=
 all
  immunoassays except the MVM ELISA. Viral DNA was detected by use of PCR
  analysis in all strains and ages of mice except DBA/2 mice. It is conclud=
ed
  that mouse strain and age have important roles in seroconversion to non
  -structural and structural MPV antigens and persistence of viral DNA in m=
ouse
  tissues. Therefore, diagnostic serological testing and PCR analysis shoul=
d be
  considered within the context of mouse strain and age at the time of MPV
  exposure, especially when sentinel mice are used for surveillance.

  dispersal of adult wasps, and to determine whether complete parasitism of=
 eggs
  within egg masses of the target host (oblique-banded leafroller (OBLR),
  Choristoneura rosaceana (Harris)) occurred. Three weekly releases of wasp=
s were
  made from a single release point in the center of each field during the f=
light
  of first generation OBLR adults. Sticky trap, sentinel egg mass and targe=
t-host
  egg mass data all indicated only a limited range of dispersal of T. minut=
um
  within the field. In addition, only partial parasitism of egg masses of t=

  target host occurred even in close proximity to the release point. We dis=

eriod.
  Two infected weaner pigs became transiently viraemic, transmitted CSFV in=
 nasal
  secretions, showed a slight leukopenia and they were serologically positi=
ve.
  Contact infection resulted in a viraemia in 2 sentinel piglets on day 30.=
 Only
  one contact animal developed antibodies. None of wild boars became viraem=
ic,
  excreted CSFV in nasal secretions or developed antibodies. It is conclude=
d that
  "Spante" isolate has low virulence.

AB: A study was conducted in April 2000 to determine the susceptibility of =
swine
  to Korean foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV; subtype O, isolated from Ch=
ungju
  province, Korea Republic). One holstein cow was inoculated intradermoling=
ually
  with a suspension of homogenized tissue from a Korean native cow naturall=
y
  infected with Korean FMDV. The infected cow was housed with one susceptib=
le cow
  and one susceptible pig (contact sentinels). Four additional susceptible =
pigs
  were housed in the same room but caged separately (non-contacted sentinel=
s).
  The contact pig and cow, as well as the non-contact pigs developed typica=
l
  clinical signs 2, 3, and 7 days post exposure, respectively. We compared
  neutralizing antibody from the animals to FMDV O1 Lombardy, O Taiwan, O1
  Campos, and O1 Manisa 0, 4, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28 days post challenge and pos=
t
  -exposure. Examination of the highest viral neutralization titre revealed=
 that
  serotype O Korea (Chungju isolate) is antigenically more related to O1 Ma=
nisa.
  In addition, immunohistochemistry was used to further characterize Korean=
 FMDV
  from tissues of infected pigs. Korean FMDV antigen was observed in the to=
ngue,
  hoof, oesophagus, and tonsil tissues of sentinel pigs. These findings sug=
gest
  that Korean FMD virus isolated from cattle can be rapidly transmitted to =
pigs
  both directly and indirectly in contrast with field observations in which=
 only
  cattle were clinically ill.

AB: The gallmidge Aphidoletes aphidimyza is used commercially to control ap=
hids
  infesting greenhouse crops such as sweet pepper and tomato. In this study=
 we
  investigated several different ways of improving its use as a biocontrol =
agent.
  In the laboratory there was a very strong relation between the availabili=
ty of
  spider's webs and successful mating. When mated in cages containing spide=
r's
  webs a greater proportion of the females were mated and the females laid =
more
  eggs compared to the females in cages without spider's webs. As adults em=
erging
  from cocoons can crawl up through 15 cm of vermiculite it is possible to
  transport and release them from bottles, which can be placed open in a
  greenhouse instead of having to spread the material around the plants.
  Dispersal of adults from the bottles was measured by placing sentinel pla=
nts
  around a single release point. Eggs of the gallmidge were found on plants=
 at
  distances up to 45 m from the release point. Intraguild predation of the =
eggs
  of the gallmidge by the mites Amblyseius degenerans and Amblyseius cucume=
ris
  was also assessed.

  studied in 6-week-old and 1-day-old SPF chickens after i.m. inoculation w=
ith
  graded doses of Cux-1 strain (106 to 102 TCID50). Viraemia, virus sheddin=
g,
  development of virus neutralizing (VN) antibodies and CAV distribution in=
 the
  thymus were studied by virus isolation, polymerase chain reaction,
  immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization until postinfection day (PI=
D) 28.
  In 6-week-old chickens infected with high doses of CAV, viraemia and VN
  antibodies could be detected 4 PID and onward without virus shedding or c=
ontact
  transmission to sentinel birds. However, virus shedding and contact
  transmission were demonstrated in 1-day-old infected chickens. In the 6-w=
eek
  -old groups infected with lower doses, VN antibodies developed by PID 14,
  transient viraemia and virus shedding were detected. The thymus cortex of=
 all 1
  -day-old inoculated chickens stained with VP3-specific mAb. Cells with po=
sitive
  in situ hybridization signal were fewer and scattered throughout the thym=
us
  tissue of 1-day-old chickens after inoculation compared with IP-positive =
cells.
  It is suggested that early immune response induced by high doses of CAV i=
n 6
  -week-old chickens prevents viral replication and virus shedding.

AB: A 48-kDa polypeptide, was found in human milk and was confirmed by mass
  spectrometry and sequencing to be a soluble form of the bacterial pattern
  recognition receptor CD14 (sCD14). Milk sCD14 (m-sCD14) concentrations we=
re up
  to 20-fold higher than serum sCD14 from non-pregnant, pregnant or lactati=
ng
  women. In contrast, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein was at very =
low
  levels. Mammary epithelial cells produced 48-kDa sCD14. m-sCD14 mediated
  activation by LPS and whole bacteria of CD14 negative cells, including
  intestinal epithelial cells, resulting in release of innate immune respon=
se
  molecules. m-sCD14 was undetectable in infant formulae and commercial cow=
 milk
  samples tested, although it was present in the colostrum. These results
  indicate a sentinel role for sCD14 in human milk during bacterial coloniz=
ation
  of the gut, and suggest that m-sCD14 may be involved in modulating local =
innate
  and adaptive immune responses, thus controlling homeostasis in the neonat=
al

AB: We conducted a community-randomized controlled trial in Pakistan to
  determine the efficacy of indoor residual spraying with alpha-cypermethri=
n
  ('Fendona', Cyanamid, NJ, USA), applied at 25 mg/m2, to prevent Plasmodiu=
m
  falciparum and P. vivax malaria. Wettable powder (WP) and suspension
  concentrate (SC) formulations were tested against an unsprayed control in=
 an
  irrigated rice-growing area of Sheikhupura district, Punjab province. The=
 study
  area of 180 km2 was divided into nine sectors, which were assigned at ran=
dom to
  control, WP, or SC treatments in replicates of 3. Sentinel villages were
  selected from each sector for entomological and disease monitoring. Malar=
ia was
  monitored by fortnightly active case detection (ACD) and by cross-section=
al
  parasite surveys on schoolchildren. Mosquito populations were monitored b=
y
  space spraying of rooms and by cattle-landing catches. The spray campaign=
 took
  place in June 1997 and covered 96% of compounds. During the 7 months afte=
r
  spraying, the incidence of falciparum malaria was 95% lower and that of v=
ivax
  malaria 80% lower in WP-sprayed than unsprayed sectors. Similar results w=
ere
  obtained for sectors sprayed with the SC formulation. Cross-sectional sur=
veys
  gave estimates of efficacy comparable to those obtained by ACD. Anopheles
  culicifacies was 80% less abundant and A. stephensi, the predominant
  anopheline, was up to 68% less abundant in sprayed areas over the 7-month
  period. Reductions in anopheline parous rates indicated that the single-s=
pray
  treatment was effective for the entire transmission season. Sprayed surfa=
ces
  lacked odour, which contributed to the popularity of the campaign. Alpha
  -cypermethrin is a promising insecticide for the control of malaria in Pa=
kistan
  and South Asia generally.

AB: This study investigated the efficacy of the parasitoid Muscidifurax

ta,
  Canada, using housefly (Musca domestica) pupae as sentinels. Mass release=
s of
  Muscidifurax raptorellus in 1997 increased parasitism of pupae 23- to 11-=
fold
  (compared with previous studies), to an overall figure of 34% (among the =
native
  species parasitizing the pupae, Eupelmus vesicularis was recorded doing s=
o for
  the first time in Alberta). M. raptorellus were recovered from sentinel p=
upae
  throughout the sampled area, up to 100 m from the point of release. The i=
nverse
  correlation between parasitism and distance from the point of release was
  statistically significant (P<0.001) but not very strong. At one site, som=
e M.
  raptorellus were recovered in 1998, indicating that they had overwintered=
, but
  this is thought to be an unusual event, as over several years of releases=
 there
  was no evidence of overwintering at the other site, and the 1997-1998 win=

  Sitotroga cerealella or codling moth) released twice over a 6- to 9-day p=
eriod
  during the oviposition of the first codling moth generation; and a spring

period
  of the second codling moth generation.. T. platneri population densities =
were
  monitored from May to September by recording the parasitism of viable sen=
tinel
  codling moth and Choristoneura rosaceana eggs. Low numbers of wild or non
  -viable codling moth eggs, or other susceptible host eggs resulted in
  sufficient eggs to maintain low spring- or summer-introduced T. platneri
  populations.. Apple damage by codling moths was significantly reduced in
  treated plots when moth infestation levels were high. In 1995, mean perce=

  codling moth damage was 50.5% in control trees, compared with 31.5% in tr=

AB: Environmental endocrine disruption in wildlife has primarily focused on
  oestrogenic/androgenic end points and their antagonists. We describe here=
 the
  work that has occurred within the Great Lakes of North America that has u=
sed
  the bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) as a sentinel species of the ef=
fects
  of environmental toxicants, including endocrine disruption. Our data sugg=
ests
  that population level effects of hormone disrupting chemicals, including =
p'p
  -DDE, not necessarily oestrogen/androgen mimics and their antagonists, ha=
ve
  been associated with reproductive and teratogenic effects observed in the=
 bald
  eagle population within the Great Lakes Basin. Additional laboratory and =
field
  studies are necessary to further clarify the role of environmental endocr=
ine
  disruptors on reproduction in avian populations. The use of sea eagles
  (Haliaeetus spp.) as biosentinels of pollution in other regions of the wo=
rld is
  also discussed.

AB: Dietary exposure to the trichothecene vomitoxin (VT) causes feed refusa=
l and
  elevates IgA production in the mouse. Based on the observations that IL-6=
 can
  cause anorexia and promote IgA production and that gene expression of thi=
s
  cytokine is increased in vivo and ex vivo on VT exposure, we hypothesized=
 that
  IL-6 is an essential cytokine in VT-induced feed refusal and IgA dysregul=
ation.
  To test this hypothesis, the effects of dietary VT on feed intake, weight=
 gain,
  serum IgA levels and kidney mesangial IgA deposition in an IL-6-"knockout=
"
  mouse (B6129-IL6tmi Kopf) were compared to those in both a corresponding =
"wild
  -type" (B6129F2) and a previously characterized "sentinel" strain (B6C3F1=
) that
  possess the intact gene for this cytokine. IL-6 deficiency did not alter =
the
  capacity of VT to cause feed refusal or impair weight gain. VT-fed B6129F=
2 and
  B6C3F1 mice had significantly higher serum IgA concentrations than did th=
eir
  corresponding controls fed clean diet, whereas significant differences we=
re not
  observed between IL-6 KO mice fed VT or control diets. Kidneys taken from=
 VT
  -fed wild-type and sentinel mice had significantly increased mesangial Ig=
A
  deposition as compared to controls. While slight increases in mesangial I=
gA
  were observed in VT-fed IL-6 KO mice, mean fluorescence intensities were
  significantly less than that found in the corresponding wild-type and sen=
tinel
  strains. IL-6 KO mice appeared to be less prone to the development of
  microscopic haematuria following VT exposure than were the corresponding =
wild
  -type and sentinel strains. In total, the results suggested that IL-6-def=
icient
  mice were refractory to VT-induced dysregulation of IgA production and
  development of IgA nephropathy, whereas chronic VT-mediated nutritional e=
ffects
  related to feed intake and weight gain were unaffected.

AB: In 1996, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved olestra, a fat
  substitute, for use in snack foods. Previous studies had shown that olest=
ra
  consumption could reduce absorption of carotenoids and fat-soluble vitami=
ns. To
  determine the association between consumption of olestra-containing snack=
 foods
  and serum concentrations of carotenoids and fat-soluble vitamins in a fre=

tional
  samples of 1043 adults before olestra was available and 933 adults 9 mont=
hs
  after olestra snacks were introduced into the marketplace in Marion Count=
y, IN,
  USA the first major test market for olestra. A cohort composed of 403 adu=
lts
  from the first survey, oversampling those most frequently reporting olest=
ra
  consumption during follow-up telephone interviews, completed a second sur=
vey.
  We assessed diet, lifestyle factors and olestra consumption, and collecte=
d
  blood for assays for the serum concentrations of six carotenoids, four fa=
t
  -soluble vitamins and lipids. Nine months after the introduction of olest=
ra
  into the marketplace, 15.5% of Marion County residents reported consuming=
 an
  olestra-containing snack in the previous month, with a median frequency a=
mong
  consumers of 3.0 times per month. There were no significant associations =
or
  consistent trends for decreased serum carotenoids or fat-soluble vitamins
  associated with olestra consumption, although cohort members consuming _2=
 g/d
  of olestra had adjusted total serum carotenoids 15% lower compared with
  baseline. There were increases in serum vitamin K concentrations associat=
ed
  with olestra consumption (P=3D0.03 in the cross section and P=3D0.06 in t=
he
  cohort). In summary, there was no statistically significant evidence in t=

  free-living population of associations between olestra consumption and
  decreased serum concentrations of carotenoids and fat-soluble vitamins.

AB: Mitotic root micronucleus (MCN) frequency in Vicia faba as a bioassay, =
is
  primarily based on the extent of the sentinel Vicia response in terms of
  cytogenetic damage quantitatively or qualitatively to indicate the presen=
ce of
  mutagenic contaminants. This paper describes an investigation designed to
  assess changes in MCN frequencies of Vicia faba from three generations of
  plants obtained from a reference site (RS) and a metal-contaminated
  experimental field (EF) in the bioassay of mutagenic Cd2+ and NaN3. The
  background value, dose-response to Cd2+ and to NaN3 in three generation (=
F1, F2
  and F3) plants of the EF and the initial (F0) plants were determined in t=
erms
  of MCN frequencies. With more generations of Vicia plants growing in the =
EF, a
  higher background value of MCN frequency, a lower slope value in the regr=
ession
  equation, a smaller ratio of MCN frequency between the control and treatm=
ent in
  the same generation and larger perturbation values were observed. This de=
notes
  that the decreased reliability and efficiency are represented in Vicia pl=
ants
  from the EF if the plants are used as sentinels in the bioassay of mutage=
nic
  Cd2+ and NaN3. It was concluded that the Vicia MCN bioassay should be use=
d as
  an endpoint biomarker acceptable in biomonitoring environmental mutagens =
when
  the sentinel plants were collected from clean areas. Because no place is
  absolutely without pollutants, it is suggested that several seed stock ce=
nters
  should be established for providing sentinel Vicia if Vicia MCN bioassay =
is
  used as a biomarker to identify the global environmental status.

AB: The extensive use of biomarkers in environment biomonitoring programmes=
 has
  raised the problem of data management and intercomparison. A research pro=
ject
  (Pollution Effect Network, PEN) is proposed here, consisting of the reali=
zation
  of an on-line warehouse for biomarker data. The web site will contain
  repository sections and expert system procedures able to integrate inform=
ation
  from different biomarkers and provide ranking of the organism health stat=
us in
  terms of synthetic stress syndrome indexes. Researchers accessing the sit=
e will
  be able to submit and process their own data. This will allow common crit=
eria
  in the evaluation of the biological effects of pollutants, and an
  intercomparison of biomonitoring data among different geographic areas an=

AB: The toxicity of the Reconquista River water at Cascallares, Argenina, a
  relatively low polluted point, was determined by means of bioassays with
  juvenile Cyprinus carpio as a test organism. During the summer of 1995-19=
96,
  three 30 days-long in situ caged fish tests were conducted. Changes in th=
e
  activities of branchial (Na+, K+)- and Mg2+-ATPases and brain AchE of fis=
h were
  studied. The chemical profile of the river water showed that heavy metals=
 and
  phenols were the main pollutants. Gill ATPases activities were altered, w=
hile
  brain AchE activity resulted inhibited in one of the assays. (Na+, K+)
  -dependent activity was inhibited approximately 20% as compared with cont=
rols;
  in two assays Mg2+-ATPase activity was stimulated. The condition factor o=
f
  caged fish did not differ from controls. Since the protein content of gil=
ls was
  slightly altered, the detected changes in the enzyme activity should not =
be
  linked to alterations in the protein synthesis.

AB: TGEV replicates in intestinal enterocytes and causes diarrhoea in young
  pigs. PRCV, a spike (S) gene deletion mutant of TGEV with an altered
  respiratory tissue tropism, causes mild or subclinical respiratory infect=
ions.
  Comparisons of TGEV and PRCV strains suggest that tropism and pathogenici=
ty are
  influenced by the S gene and ORF3, respectively. Recently, outbreaks of T=
GE of
  reduced virulence were reported in the field. A similar suspect TGEV outb=
reak
  of reduced virulence in nursery pigs from a swine herd in the Midwest was
  investigated. A TGEV strain (BW021898B) was isolated in swine testicular =
cells
  from gut contents of a diarrhoeic pig and three PRCV strains (BW126, BW15=
4,
  BW155) were isolated from nasal swabs from normal TGEV-seronegative senti=
nel
  pigs in contact with the diarrhoeic pigs. Sequence analysis of the TGEV i=
solate
  in the partial S gene and ORF3/3a and ORF3-1/3b revealed high homology wi=
th
  enteropathogenic TGEV strains. Gnotobiotic pig inoculation and
  histopathological results revealed that this TGEV isolate retained virule=
nce
  even though in the field outbreak the diarrhoeal disease was of reduced
  severity. Sequence analysis of the S gene deletion region of the three PR=
CV
  isolates revealed identical deletions between nt 105-752, which differ fr=
om
  deletions previously reported among PRCV strains. The three PRCV isolates=
 had
  variable sequence changes in ORF 3/3a and ORF 3-1/3b, affecting the ORF s=
ize
  and amino acid sequence. Thus, sequence analysis and pathogenicity studie=
s
  indicate that this TGEV isolate resembles other enteropathogenic TGEV str=
ains.
  Therefore, the reduced severity of TGE observed in this herd may be due t=
o the
  ongoing PRCV infections, which induce antibodies cross-reactive with TGEV=
 and
  result in decreased disease severity. The results outlined in this study
  highlight the need to monitor the molecular epidemiology of TGEV/PRCV str=
ains
  with sensitive differential diagnostic assays, followed by sequence analy=
sis of
  the critical regions to identify changes and pathogenicity studies to con=
firm
  the disease potential of the TGEV isolates.

  enteritidis strain LA5. However, for some mutants, the numbers of organis=
ms
  recovered from internal organs was reduced significantly, particularly at=
 24 h
  post-inoculum, which supported the hypothesis that the organelles contrib=
ute to
  invasion and dissemination to internal organs. Specifically, mutations
  affecting SEF17, SEF21 and flagella contributed to a delay in colonizatio=
n of
  the spleen, and those affecting SEF21 and flagella delayed colonization o=
f the
  liver. Lower numbers of bacteria were recovered from the caecum with muta=

r
  EAV40 (14-, 17-, 21-, fla-) directly from the environment within 2 days,
  although a consistent slight delay was observed with the multiple mutant.
  Overall, our data suggest a collective role for SEF17, SEF21 and flagella=
, but
  not SEF14, in the early stages of colonization and invasion of young chic=
ks by
  S. enteritidis, but these surface appendages appear unnecessary for

AB: A global study was carried out in the agropastoral zone of Sideradougou
  (Burkina Faso) on risk assessment of trypanosomiasis transmission. Sentin=
el
  herds from two different farming systems were sampled and followed up dur=
ing
  two years. The monthly incidences of infections were measured and interpr=
eted
  according to the movements of herds, their practices for watering and the=
ir
  contacts with the riparian tsetse flies (Glossina tachinoides and G. palp=
alis
  gambiensis). In Nakaka, a Fulani breeders' village 4 km away from the riv=
er,
  the parasites are transmitted during the dry season at the point of perma=
nent
  watering places inside the forest gallery. In rainy season, the tsetse fl=
ies
  disperse through the savannah and infect cattle even in the village. In P=
efrou,
  a group of farmers' settlements, herds are made up mainly of draught catt=
le.
  Animals from settlements located near the hydrographic network drink in t=
he
  river and are regularly infected all the year long. The incidences are hi=
gher
  during the rainy season and the beginning of the dry season when tsetse f=
lies
  are the most abundant. On the other and, herds from the settlements far a=
way (3
  km) from the hydrographic network are watered from wells and do not frequ=
ent
  the habitats of vectors. In such an agricultural landscape, tsetse flies =
do not
  disperse even in the rainy season. Incidences in these herds are almost n=
il.
  These results prove the importance of space and temporal contacts between=
 hosts
  and vectors in the epidemiology of trypanosomiasis in West Africa.

S
  (Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis) were compared in plastic pools
  containing laboratory-reared C. quinquefasciatus larvae located in a wood=
ed
  area in Panama City, Florida, USA, in August and September 1997. The pool=
s were
  dipped at 2-day intervals to assess larval control. Sentinel larvae in sc=
reen
  -sided cups were added to all treatment and control pools at 4-day interv=
als
  and evaluated for infection at 48 h. Laginex produced larval control up t=
o 20
  days as compared to the Vectobac-12AS compound, which required retreatmen=
t by
  the 10th day. The most effective control was attained by the Laginex 25
  treatment, which reduced larvae in the pools by 100% for 22 days. Control=
 in
  the Laginex 15 and Laginex 35 treatments dropped to 90% and 74% at day 13=
 and
  day 9, respectively. The numbers of infected larvae remained above 50% as
  larval control was assessed, but dropped and fluctuated when water temper=
atures
  were lowered at the onset of cold weather. Organic pollution did not prov=
e to
  be a significant factor in the evaluations.

 of
  moderate gradient that received effluent outfalls from an uranium enrichm=
ent
  plant at Big Bayou Creek, Kentucky, USA in october 1987, April 1988 and J=
une
  1988. Metal BBs (e.g., Ag, Cd, Cr, Cu) increased in the order Cheumatopsy=
che
  spp., Campostoma anomalum and Stenonema spp. This was consistent with the=
ir
  classifications as metal-tolerant, moderately tolerant, and sensitive tax=
a,
  respectively. The Ag, Cd, and Cu BBs in stoneroller minnows from upstream=
,
  effluent-receiving, and downstream stations correlated strongly with
  macroinvertebrate bioassessment (BA) scores (r_-0.95), numbers of taxa (r=
=3D
  -0.95), and the Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera indices (r=3D-0.82=
 to=20
  -0.94). Proportional differences in metal BBs in the minnow were used to =
derive
  metal multipliers that were applied to total recoverable metal concentrat=
ions
  to calculate bioavailable metal. The bioavailable metal fractions correla=
ted
  with BA scores and numbers of taxa (e.g., Ag, r_-0.97; Cu, r=3D-0.95). Wh=
en five
  metals (i.e., Ag, Cd, Cu, Cr, Pb) were included in an additive model, res=
ults
  also correlated with BA scores (r=3D-0.93) and numbers of taxa (r=3D-0.86=
). Metal
  BB in minnows was a strong indicator of ecological impact and provided a =
means
  of determining bioavailable metals. The development of the metal biosenso=
r,
  which incorporates a reconstructed fish gill epithelium, the primary targ=

AB: A variety of vascular plant species exhibit typical foliar injury sympt=
oms
  when exposed to ambient ozone, making them useful as bioindicators of rel=
ative
  air quality for a particular location or region. They are quite useful in=
 areas
  where mechanical ozone monitors are not available. Bioindicators are ofte=
n
  introduced plant species known as sentinels. They are known to be sensiti=
ve to
  ozone and will respond rapidly if they are given special care to ensure o=
zone
  uptake and injury. Sentinels are usually genetically-uniform, rapid growi=
ng
  herbaceous annuals. Their rapid and well-characterized response to ozone
  exposure has made them quite useful. Bel-W3 tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) i=
s a
  sentinel plant bioindicator for ozone that is used all over the world. De=
tector
  bioindicators are plant species that are found growing naturally in an ar=
ea and
  known to be sensitive to ozone only when conditions are appropriate for o=
zone
  uptake and plant injury. Detectors are often slow-growing, determinate
  perennial plants, shrubs, or trees that respond slowly to ozone, with sym=
ptoms
  occurring quite late in the growing season. Populations of detectors are =
not
  genetically uniform and only part of a population may show ozone injury
  symptoms. Black cherry (Prunus serotina) is a common detector bioindicato=
r for
  ozone in North America. A comparison of surveys of sentinel and detector
  bioindicators in the same area often show different results. From an ecol=
ogical
  perspective, visible injury on a detector bioindicator is more significan=
t than
  visible injury on a sentinel bioindicator. When using plants as bioindica=
tors,
  careful consideration needs to be given to the nature, requirements, and
  utility of sentinels and detectors in relation to the relevance and utili=
ty of
  the results obtained.

  counts. In 1998 all 4 groups were grazed together as 1 herd from 23 April=
 to 26
  October and infections were monitored with the same techniques (with the
  exception of sentinel calves). In the FGS weight gain was higher in G4 th=
an in
  the other groups and higher in G3 (28.6 kg) than in G1. Weight gain of G2=
 was
  intermediate to G1 and G3 but did not significantly differ from either gr=
oup.
  In the SGS weight gain in G4 was far less than in any other group and the=
 mean
  weight at the end of the experiment was 41.9, 38.6 and 50.9 kg lower than=
 in
  G3, G1 and G2, respectively. Though no significant differences were obser=
ved
  between G1, G2 and G3 at the end of the experiment it was obvious that th=
e
  weight gain advantage of G3 over G1 at the end of the FGS had disappeared=
.
  Parasitological and serological findings in the SGS indicated that G3 and=
 G4
  had built up less immunity during the FGS than had G1 and G2. It is concl=
uded
  that resilience to parasitic gastroenteritis in the 2nd grazing season de=
pends
  on the level of exposure to nematodes in the first grazing season. Howeve=
r,
  problems with poor weight gain will only be expected when exposure is ver=
y low
  in the first grazing season and high in the 2nd. C. oncophora and Osterta=
gia
  were the dominant nematodes found.

AB: A study of malaria prevalence and transmission was carried out in Khart=
oum,
  Sudan, from October 1995 to December 1996. The sentinel sites were El man=
shia,
  an urban area on the Blue Nile and Ed dekheinat, a lower-income peri-urba=
n area
  bordering the White Nile. Anopheles arabiensis, the only malaria vector
  encountered, was present throughout the year although vector density vari=
ed
  seasonally. Plasmodium falciparum was the only species found in El manshi=
a. In
  Ed dekheinat P. falciparum, P. ovale and P. vivax constituted 84.9, 8.2 a=
nd
  6.9% of the cases, respectively. P. ovale appears to have recently spread=
 into
  Khartoum since it has not previously been reported there. It is concluded=
 that
  focal transmission of malaria in the districts bordering both Niles has b=
ecome
  established and that the reservoir of human infections has increased in r=
ecent
  years leading to increased risk of malaria epidemics, particularly in the
  aftermath of seasonal flooding.

(which
  carries Bs1), and ECW-20R (which carries Bs2). Similar results were obtai=

 major

  Bs2 + Bs3) than on isolines ECW, ECW-10R, ECW-20R, and ECW-30R (Bs3), but=
 not
  on ECW-23R (BS2 + Bs3). In greenhouse studies with commercial hybrids, st=

  Camelot (carries no known resistance genes), King Arthur (Bs1), and X3R C=

  Sentinel (Bs1 + Bs3) than on Camelot. Residual effects were not as eviden=
t in
  field studies with race 6 strains. Defeated major resistance genes deploy=
ed in
  specific gene combinations were associated with less area under the disea=
se
  progress curve than when genes were deployed individually in isolines of =
ECW or
  commercial hybrids. Although there is evidence of residual effects from
  defeated genes, these effects alone likely will not provide acceptable
  bacterial spot control in commercial production fields.

AB: Biochemical measures of nutrients or other dietary constituents can be =
an

curate
  interpretation of the nutrient concentration is dependent on knowledge of=
 the
  determinants of the body pool measured. The purpose of this study was to
  identify the determinants of serum carotenoid and fat-soluble vitamin
  concentrations in a large, community-based sample (n=3D1042). Multiple li=
near
  regression analysis was used to examine effects of demographic characteri=
stics
  (age, sex, race/ethnicity, education), health-related behavior (exercise,=
 sun
  exposure, smoking, alcohol consumption), and intake (diet, supplements) o=
n
  serum retinol, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, alpha-tocopherol, phylloquinone, and
  carotenoid concentrations. Age, sex, race/ethnicity, vitamin A intake, an=
d
  alcohol consumption were found to be determinants of serum retinol
  concentration. Race/ethnicity, vitamin D intake, body mass index, smoking
  status, and sun exposure were determinants of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D
  concentration. Determinants of serum alpha-tocopherol were age, sex,
  race/ethnicity, alpha-tocopherol intake, serum cholesterol, percentage of
  energy from fat (inversely related), supplement use, and body mass index.=
 Age,
  sex, phylloquinone intake, serum triglycerides, and supplement use were
  determinants of serum phylloquinone concentration. Primary determinants o=
f
  serum carotenoids were age, sex, race/ethnicity, carotenoid intake, serum
  cholesterol, alcohol consumption, body mass index, and smoking status. Ov=
erall,
  the demographic, dietary, and other lifestyle factors explained little of=
 the
  variability in serum concentrations of retinol (R2=3D0.20), 25-hydroxyvit=
amin D
  (R2=3D0.24), and the carotenoids (R2=3D0.15-0.26); only modest amounts of=
 the
  variability in serum phylloquinone concentration (R2=3D0.40); and more
  substantial amounts of the variability in serum alpha-tocopherol concentr=

a,
  antimicrobials and animal species have been defined for each of these gro=

  data analysis and reporting. Surveillance of sick animals was first imple=
mented
  using Escherichia coli as the sentinel bacterium. Surveillance of E. coli=
 and
  Enterococcus faecium from healthy pigs was implemented in 1998. In July 1=

  data collection on Salmonella spp. was initiated in poultry slaughterhous=

  Additionally, the prevalence of vancomycin resistant E. faecium was also
  monitored. This network has specific topics of interest related to method=

  L. deliense attached to sentinel R. rattus, of which 314 larvae successfu=
lly
  fed to repletion and were recovered, and 2 (0.6%) of these were naturally
  infected with O. tsutsugamushi. The occurrence of L. deliense was influen=
ced by
  rainfall, with more chiggers attached to rodents in the wetter months of =
the
  year. The study showed that the risk of exposure to infection with O.
  tsutsugamushi is greater during the wetter months of the year, and that o=
nly a
  relatively small number of chigger attachments are needed to infect poten=

AB: In May 1998 the Demodex mite was found in mouse hair samples collected
  during efficacy screenings in an ongoing ectoparasite treatment trial for
  Radfordia affinis, in Texas, USA. An investigation was undertaken to dete=
rmine
  the extent of the Demodex infestation within the facility and the origina=
l
  source of the parasite. D. musculi was found in 3 of the 4 mouse genotype=
s
  present in the index room and in one of these genotypes in two other room=
s. The
  mite was not found in sentinel mice, other strains, or stocks within the
  facility. The mites were more easily recovered from the immunodeficient B=
6,CBA
  -TgN(CD3E)26Cpt transgenic (Tg) and the hybrid double-Tg (B6,CBA-TgN(CD3E=
)26Cpt
  X B6,SENCARB-TgN(pk5prad1)7111Sprd)F1 mice than from the B6,SENCARB
  -TgN(pk5prad1)7111Sprd Tg mouse, which is believed to be immunocompetent
  despite its thymic abnormalities. Histopathologic examination showed D. m=
usculi
  superficially in hair follicles but not in the preputial or clitoral glan=
d or
  in serial sections of the head, eyelids, or ears. Physical and microscopi=
c
  examination revealed no dermatitis. The immune deficiency in the B6,CBA
  -TgN(CD3E)26Cpt mouse probably provided the permissive host conditions th=
at
  contributed to the proliferation and subsequent detection of the Demodex.
  Preliminary transmission experiments conducted with other immunologic mut=
ant
  mice and our sentinel strain demonstrated variation in mite transfer and =
in
  either detection or maintenance of infestation when naive mice were house=
d with
  those carrying D. musculi. The original source of D. musculi was not
  conclusively identified, but this parasite appears to be of low pathogeni=
city
  in the examined genotypes.

AB: Besides humans, many animals can be infected by the tick-borne encephal=
itis
  virus (TBEV), with or without developing clinical signs, and thus they ma=
y
  serve as indicators for TBE endemicity. Game animals like deer, wild boar=
, and
  foxes are usually heavily infested with ticks. In contrast to other anima=
ls,
  foxes are known to live in habitats with only a small radius (about 7 to =
10 km,
  rarely up to 50 km). In this way, a fox normally represents the place whe=
re it
  is found, and the local rate of anti-TBEV-seropositive foxes may indicate=
 the
  TBE endemicity in that very region. In order to investigate various geogr=
aphic
  regions in view of the possible occurrence of TBE, sera of foxes in diffe=
rent
  areas were collected and tested for antibodies against TBEV by ELISA. Six
  regions with different TBE incidences were studied: southwestern Germany =
(n=3D79
  foxes, seroprevalence 34.2%), eastern Black Forest Area (n=3D153 foxes,
  seroprevalence 9.8%), Odenwald (n=3D50 foxes, seroprevalence 10.0%), Taun=
us (n=3D50
  foxes, seroprevalence 2.0%), Brandenburg (n=3D86 foxes, seroprevalence 0%=
),
  northeastern France (n=3D55 foxes, seroprevalence 1.8%). The comparative
  descriptive analysis showed that the anti-TBEV seroprevalence in foxes
  reflected well the TBE incidences in different regions. Thus, foxes may b=
e used
  to screen for TBE endemicity in various geographic areas. As in many dist=
ricts
  fox sera are collected for rabies control, longitudinal investigations on=
 TBE
  endemicity may be based on those samples. Additionally, species which are
  easier to access (e.g. cows or goats) may be used as a sentinel system in=
 areas
  with pastures and grazing flocks.

  mosquito larvae in mangrove swamps on Sanibel Island, Florida, USA, in Ma=

  1997. Three sites per treatment and 3 untreated sites were used. Temephos
  (Abate) was applied at 37 ml/ha (43% active ingredient [AI]), B.t.i. gran=
ules
  (Vectobac G) were applied at 5.606 kg/ha (200 International Toxic Units/m=
g),
  and methoprene (Altosid ALL) was applied at 213 ml/ha (5% AI). Efficacy w=
as
  quantified by monitoring the survival of caged and uncaged larval Aedes
  taeniorhynchus. We quantified mortality of sentinel nontarget amphipods
  (Talitridae) at all sites, monitored the effect of temephos on flying
  arthropods using light traps, and collected dead insects in traps suspend=
ed
  under mangroves in areas treated with either temephos or methoprene. Each
  pesticide showed good overall efficacy but occasional failures occurred. =
No
  detectable mortality of amphipods or flying insects attributable to pesti=
cides
  was found. The inconsistent field efficacies of the pesticides indicate a=
 need
  for reinspection of treated sites in this habitat.

AB: A small-volume sentinel chamber was developed to assess the effects of
  environmental stresses on survival of sucrose-Percoll-purified Cryptospor=
idium
  parvum oocysts in soil and animal wastes. Chambers were tested for their
  ability to equilibrate with external chemical and moisture conditions. Se=
ntinel
  oocysts were then exposed to stresses of the external environment that af=
fected
  their viability (potential infectivity), as indicated by results of a dye
  permeability assay. Preliminary laboratory experiments indicated that
  temperatures between 35 and 50oC and decreases in soil water potential (-=
0.003
  to -3.20 MPa) increased oocyst inactivation rates. The effects of 2 commo=
n
  animal waste management practices on oocyst survival were investigated on=
 3
  dairy farms in New York State, USA: (i) piling wastes from dairy youngsto=
ck
  (including neonatal calves) and (ii) spreading wastes as a soil amendment=
 on an
  agricultural field. Sentinel containers filled with air-dried and sieved =
(2-mm
  mesh) youngstock waste or field soil were wetted and inoculated with 2 mi=
llion
  oocysts in an aqueous suspension and then placed in waste piles on 2 diff=
erent
  farms and in soil within a cropped field on one farm. Controls consisted =
of
  purified oocysts in either phosphate-buffered saline or distilled water
  contained in sealed microcentrifuge tubes. Two microdata loggers recorded=
 the
  ambient temperature at each field site. Sentinel experiments were conduct=
ed
  during the fall and winter (1996 to 1997) and winter (1998). Sentinel
  containers and controls were removed at 2- to 4-week intervals and oocyst=
s were
  extracted and tested by the dye permeability assay. The proportions of
  potentially infective oocysts exposed to the soil and waste pile material
  decreased more rapidly than their counterpart controls exposed to buffer =
or
  water, indicating that factors other than temperature affected oocyst
  inactivation in the waste piles and soil. The effect of soil freeze-thaw =
cycles
  was evident in the large proportion of empty sentinel oocysts. The potent=
ially
  infective sentinel oocysts were reduced to <1% while the proportions in
  controls did not decrease below 50% during the first field experiment.
  Microscopic observations of empty oocyst fragments indicated that abrasiv=
e
  effects of soil particles were a factor in oocyst inactivation.

66, 4
  reindeer calves (3 seronegative for toxoplasmosis and one seropositive as=
 a
  result of congenital infection) were inoculated with 500 Toxoplasma gondi=
i
  oocysts (M3 isolate); as a result they developed mild symptoms and the
  seronegative ones seroconverted. Four days after inoculation they were pl=
aced
  in an enclosure with 7 seronegative calves of the same age and kept there=
 for
  14 days; the sentinel animals were then followed up for a further 19 days=
 (30
  days of follow-up was intended, but 6 animals were killed by a bear on da=
y 19).
  None of them seroconverted or showed any symptoms. It is concluded that
  although lateral transmission by tachyzoites is possible, its occurrence
  remains unproven.

AB: Over a 2-year period (1993-94) field trials were conducted in New York =
to
  assess the potential to disrupt the mating of Plutella xylostella (L.) us=
ing a
  commercial rope formulation of a 70:30 mixture of (Z)-11-hexadecenal and =
(Z)-11
  -hexadecenyl acetate, two components of the sex pheromone of the female.
  Screened field cages were placed into blocks of cabbages which were eithe=
r
  treated with the pheromone or left untreated. Different densities of P.
  xylostella pupae were placed into each cage and then larval and pupal cou=
nts
  were made of the subsequent generation. In addition, sentinel females at =
mating
  stations were placed in each cage to assess the influence of the pheromon=
e on
  the ability of males to locate and mate with females. Similarly, pheromon=
e
  traps were used to assess whether the pheromone treatment influenced the
  ability of males to locate a pheromone source. In both years larval and p=
upal
  populations, produced as a result of the original inoculation, did not di=
ffer
  between pheromone-treated and untreated fields. The effect of pheromone
  treatment on larval and pupal numbers did not change with changes in inoc=
ulated
  P. xylostella density. However, the density of P. xylostella released cau=
sed
  significant differences in the density of the subsequent generation. No
  significant differences were detected between the number of sentinel fema=
le
  adult P. xylostella that successfully mated in pheromone-treated fields
  compared with untreated fields. Significant differences in the numbers of=
 male
  P. xylostella caught in pheromone-baited traps occurred between pheromone
  -treated and untreated fields in the first trial of 1993, and in the firs=
t
  trial in 1994 but not in the second trial. Such differences are often tho=
ught
  of as indications of mating disruption, although our other data presented=
 in
  this study and reports from other studies indicated that this is not alwa=
ys the
  case. Previous studies on mating disruption of P. xylostella in larger sc=
ale
  field tests have been performed but the results have been variable and of=
ten
  ambiguous. Overall, the results indicate that mating disruption of P.
  xylostella with the present technology does not appear to work even under=
 the
  very controlled situations utilized to eliminate insect movement between =
plots.

  adults (aged >18 years, n=3D125; mean age 39 years, 67% females) who cons=
ulted an
  environmental health specialty clinic. In the paediatric patients' exposu=
re
  history, widespread fungal contamination of water-damaged building materi=
als
  with known toxic or allergic fungi was identified. Primarily disorders of=
 the
  respiratory system, skin mucous membranes, and central nervous system wer=

  reported. Some enumeration and functional laboratory abnormalities, mainl=
y of
  the lymphatic blood cells, were observed, although no statistically signi=
ficant
  differences were found. IgE or IgG fungi-specific antibodies, used as exp=
osure
  markers, were positive in <25% of all tested cases. In an evaluation of a
  symptomatic girl aged 11 years (sentinel case investigation) living in an
  apartment with verified toxinogenic fungi (S. chartarum), several health
  indicators showed improvement after exposure cessation.

LA: English
AB: An improved bluetongue antigen capture ELISA (BTACE) technique was eval=
uated
  for its ability to detect the full range of 24 bluetongue (BLU) serotypes=
. The
  BTACE detected all 24 serotypes in cell culture fluids, including 8 serot=
ypes
  where the representative strains originated from both Australia and also =
from
  the South African reference collection. The amount of infectious virus re=
quired
  to obtain a positive BTACE result varied between 100 and 1000 TCID50. The=
 BTACE
  method was compared with conventional passage in cell culture to detect t=
he
  presence of virus in the tissues of embryonated chicken eggs (ECEs) which=
 had
  been inoculated i.v. with the blood of sheep and cattle infected experime=
ntally
  with the 8 Australian serotypes of BLU (1, 3, 9, 15, 16, 20, 21 and 23). =
The
  BTACE method was at least as sensitive as the conventional cell culture
  detecting virus in ECEs, obviating the need for prolonged cell culture pa=
ssage
  to detect the virus. A comparison of the amount of antigen detected in
  different embryo tissues indicated that liver homogenates gave the highes=
t
  positive to negative ratios in the BTACE and were selected as the specime=
n of
  choice. In studies of sheep infected with all 24 South African reference =
BLU
  serotypes this new BTACE was able to detect viraemia with all serotypes. =
The
  BTACE was validated in surveillance programmes for BLU in both New South =
Wales,
  Australia and in Yunnan Province, China. Blood samples from sentinel catt=
le
  were inoculated into ECEs. Homogenized ECE livers were tested by BTACE an=
d
  those positive were passaged subsequently in cell culture for virus isola=
tion
  and identification. This protocol led to the efficient isolation of field
  isolates of many serotypes. It is concluded that the high sensitivity and=
 broad
  reactivity of the method indicates that it should be valuable for BLU dia=
gnosis
  and surveillance programmes.

AB: Three identical transmission experiments were successively performed to
  quantitatively evaluate the possible transmission of a gE-negative bovine
  herpesvirus 1 (BHV1) vaccine strain among cattle. In total, 38 Holstein
  Friesian cattle, aged 6-10 months, were used. After intranasal inoculatio=
n, the
  vaccine virus was excreted in high titres in nasal fluids. However, the v=
accine
  virus was transmitted to only one sentinel in one experiment, and not to =
any of
  the 10 sentinel cattle in the other 2 experiments. Based on these observa=
tions,
  it is concluded that the expected number of cases per vaccine-inoculated
  animal, i.e. the transmission ratio R0 of the vaccine strain, is signific=
antly
  below 1. The R0 was estimated to be 0.14. After intramuscular inoculation=
,
  shedding of vaccine virus was not detected. Therefore, it is highly unlik=
ely
  that this live gE-negative BHV1 vaccine strain will perpetuate in the cat=
tle
  population.

AB: Medical records of 32 dogs with medullary rim (a distinct hyperechoic l=
ine
  in the renal medulla parallel to the corticomedullary junction) sign were
  reviewed retrospectively. 18 dogs (56%) had no evidence of renal dysfunct=
ion
  while 14 dogs (44%) had clinicopathological evidence of renal disease,
  including 6 (19%) that had hypercalcaemic nephropathy. Most dogs (72%) in=
 which
  medullary rim sign was the only ultrasonographic finding affecting the ki=
dneys
  had no evidence of renal dysfunction. In contrast, 78% dogs that had medu=
llary
  rim sign and other renal signs (reduced size, increased medullary echogen=
icity
  and pyelectasia) had renal disease. It is concluded that the medullary ri=
m sign
  appears to be a non-specific ultrasonographic sign; however, the possibil=
ity
  cannot be excluded that is a sentinel sign of subclinical renal disease.

AB: The aim of this study was to evaluate the credentials of the use of sen=
tinel
  lymphatic mapping for breast cancer. The sentinel lymph node (SLN) is def=
ined
  as the first lymph node receiving lymphatic drainage from a tumour. The S=
LN
  accurately reflects the status of the axillary nodes in patients with ear=
ly
  -stage breast cancer, and SLN mapping is gaining widespread acceptance. F=
ew of
  the many published feasibility studies of lymphatic mapping for breast ca=
ncer
  have adequate numbers to assess the credentials of this new procedure. 50=
0
  consecutive SLN biopsies were performed at 1 institution, over a 20-month
  period, by 8 surgeons, using isosulfan blue dye and technetium-labelled s=
ulfur
  colloid. The authors reviewed each surgeon's success rate in finding the =
SLN
  and false-negative rate, relative to level of experience with the techniq=
ue.
  Lymphatic mapping performed by an experienced surgeon (surgeon A, B, or C=
) was
  associated with a higher success rate (94%) than when it was performed by=
 one
  with less experience (86%). 10 failed mapping procedures occurred in the =
first
  100 cases. For each of the ensuing 100 cases, there were 8, 6, 6 and 4 fa=
iled
  mapping procedures, suggesting that increasing experience does not eradic=
ate
  failed mapping procedures completely. The false-negative rate among 104
  patients in whom axillary dissection was planned in advance was 10.6% (5/=
47).
  Most false-negative results occurred early in the surgeon's experience: w=
hen
  the first 6 cases of every surgeon were excluded, the false-negative rate=
 fell
  to 5.2% (2/38). With increasing experience, failed SLN localizations and =
false
  -negative SLN biopsies occur less often. Combined dye and isotope localiz=
ation,
  enhanced histopathology, a back-up axillary dissection, and judicious cas=
e
  selection are required to avoid the high false-negative rate when the tec=
hnique
  is at the early stages of use by a given surgeon.

  foxes, horses, deer, and house and white-footed mice. Antibodies to B.
  burgdorferi were found in all species tested from each locale. Seasonal d=

AB: Blood and serum from 3915 wild and domestic birds (2590 resident, 139
  migrant, and 1186 captive), representing 56 species collected in central
  Florida in 1989-97, were analysed for evidence of St. Louis encephalitis =
(SLE)
  virus transmission. All sera were tested for SLE haemagglutination inhibi=
tion
  (HI) antibody. Selected sera and bloods were tested for SLE neutralizing =
(NT)
  antibody and virus. The reproductive success of resident birds was highes=
t from
  1990-92 and lowest from 1994-97. Transmission of SLE to resident birds,
  especially mourning doves (Zenaida macroura), peaked during the summer of=
 1990,
  a year during which a widespread SLE epidemic was recorded in central Flo=
rida.
  The SLE antibody-positive resident birds 1st appeared during September of=
 the
  epidemic year. Some SLE, HI antibody-positive resident birds were capture=
d
  throughout 1991, but only 5% were yearlings, compared with 36% in 1990. B=
y
  1993, wild resident birds expressing HI and NT antibodies to SLE had near=
ly
  disappeared. None of the migrant birds tested were SLE-positive. Sentinel
  chickens maintained in Indian River County during the epidemic year
  seroconverted to SLE starting in early July with peak seroconversion rate=
s in
  August, September and October. High (_50%) SLE seroconversion rates in se=
ntinel
  chickens preceded those in wild birds by 10 weeks and preceded peak human=
 SLE
  transmission by at least 8 weeks. Major SLE epidemics in south Florida de=
pend
  on abundant wild bird populations, especially during the amplification ph=
ase of
  the transmission cycle. It is proposed that hard winter freezes along the
  temperate-subtropical climatic zone interface in central Florida, at _27o=
30'
  North Latitude, opens foraging and nesting habitats for ground-feeding bi=
rds,
  resulting in high reproductive success and an abundance of seronegative
  individuals that rapidly amplify the SLE later in the year.

  injected subcutaneously in the neck with a controlled-release microsphere
  formulation of ivermectin at the rate of 2.4 mg a.i./kg body weight; the =
other
  group was injected with carrier only. Beginning 4 weeks after injection a=
nd
  continuing throughout the remainder of the test (16 weeks), no engorged t=
icks
  (_5.5 mm) were found on any of the treated cattle, whereas large numbers =
of
  engorged ticks were found on the untreated controls. During this period, =
a few
  ticks were recovered from untreated sentinel animals placed in the treatm=
ent
  pasture during 7-8 weeks after treatment, but none were recovered from an=
imals
  exposed from weeks 11-12 or 14-15. Large numbers of B. annulatus ticks we=
re
  found on untreated sentinel cattle placed in the control pasture during t=
hese
  same periods. Although the cattle, pastures, and tick habitat were
  approximately equal, the treated cattle gained an average of 77 kg compar=
ed
  with an average of 42 kg for the control group. This technology offers a
  possible alternative to the current official programme of dipping and vac=
ating
  pastures for eradication of Boophilus sp. infestations from the quarantin=

  before and after insecticide application and the survival of Aedes melani=
mon or
  Culex tarsalis larvae held in sentinel cages was compared. At Colusa, Gam=
busia
  affinis were also used as sentinels, caged adult A. melanimon were used o=
ver
  the wetlands to test for pesticide efficacy and drift, and night-flying i=
nsects
  were sampled using ultraviolet light traps. Results showed no detectable
  reductions in the abundance or biomass of aquatic macroinvertebrates in t=
reated
  wetlands. Larval mosquitoes showed high survival in all areas. All adult
  mosquitoes died when caged over wetlands treated with malathion or permet=
hrin,
  but all survived in controls. All G. affinis survived. Flying insect abun=
dance
  decreased after insecticide application in both treated and control wetla=
nds
  but rebounded in 48 h. Results indicated that ULV applications of these
  insecticides to control adult mosquitoes are unlikely to have substantial
  effects on the aquatic insects or fish in seasonal wetlands.

AB: It has been previously reported that tickborne encephalitis (TBE) is en=
demic
  in a specific area of Hokkaido, Japan. In Oshima, the southern part of
  Hokkaido, TBE virus was isolated from sentinel dogs, ticks (Ixodes persul=
catus
  and Haemaphysalis concinna) and rodents (Apodemus speciosus and Clethrion=
omys
  rufocanus) in 1995 and 1996. To identify when these TBE viruses emerged i=
n
  Hokkaido, the times of divergence of TBE virus strains isolated in Oshima=
 and
  far-eastern Russia were estimated. TBE virus was isolated in Khabarovsk i=
n 1998
  and the nucleotide sequences of viral envelope protein genes of isolates =
from
  Oshima and Khabarovsk were compared. From the synonymous substitution rat=
e of
  these virus strains, the lineage divergence time of these TBE virus strai=
ns was
  predicted phylogenetically to be about 260-430 years ago. Furthermore, th=
e
  virulence of TBE virus isolates from Oshima and Khabarovsk were compared =
in a
  mouse model. The results showed that the isolates possessed very similar
  virulence in mice. This report provides evidence that the Oshima strains =
of TBE
  virus in Hokkaido emerged from far-eastern Russia a few hundred years ago=
 and
  this explains why these strains possess virulence similar to the TBE viru=
ses
  isolated in Russia. The EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ accession numbers for the new
  nucleotide sequences are AB001026, AB022290-AB022297 and AB022703.

  detected at concentrations as low as 10-3 plaque-forming units (PFU) and =
10-5
  PFU, respectively, in a supernatant of virus-infected cells. It was possi=

  subject to increasing pressure from the effects of epigean habitat degrad=

  and recreational caving activities. Hickmania troglodytes is a prominent =
member
  of the Tasmanian (Australia) cave fauna, a spider of phylogenetic,
  zoogeographic and ecological importance, but about which little has previ=
ously
  been known. Long-term monitoring has revealed many unusual life-cycle
  characteristics in this species, most of which occur over long periods of=
 time
  and are dependent upon environmental stability. The species presents a
  potentially useful tool in the management and monitoring of cave fauna an=
d
  karst, as it is large, conspicuous, numerous, ubiquitous, sedentary,
  functionally significant and potentially sensitive to various sources of
  disturbance. H. troglodytes may provide a visible and obvious measure of
  disturbance in and around cave entrances, and may also prove useful in
  detecting broader scale impacts affecting the entire cave. The use of ind=
icator
  or sentinel species may play an important role within larger management
  strategies for cave fauna and karst.

AB: This study was conducted to determine if application of transdermal 2%
  nitroglycerine ointment (TDNG) to dogs anaesthetized with alpha chloralos=
e
  would produce splenic dilatation by relaxation of venous smooth muscle.
  Sonomicrometer crystals were applied to the spleen in each of 15 dogs, an=
d a
  pressure-measuring catheter was inserted into a splenic vein. The
  sonomicrometer crystals permitted measurement of splenic dimension, which=
 is
  known to correlate with splenic volume. Ten dogs were given 2.5 cm TDNG/1=
0 kg,
  and 5 dogs (vehicle controls) were given only petrolatum, both applied to=
 the
  inner surface of the auricular pinna. Splenic dimension in all dogs recei=
ving
  TDNG increased significantly by 7.0=B14.8%, whereas splenic dimension in =
dogs
  receiving petrolatum did not increase. Splenic venous pressures did not c=
hange
  significantly in either group. Spleens began to dilate 482=B1652 seconds =
after
  application of TDNG and achieved maximal dilatation at 861=B1632 seconds.=
 Splenic
  dilatation occurred in the absence of elevation of splenic venous pressur=
e,
  indicating that the dilatation probably resulted from relaxation of splen=
ic
  smooth muscle. TDNG was absorbed transdermally and produced splenic dilat=
ation
  in healthy dogs anaesthetized with alpha chloralose. If the spleen is a
  sentinel for peripheral veins, then TDNG may increase venous capacity,
  retaining blood from the lungs and thereby functioning to reduce pulmonar=
y
  congestion and oedema in dogs with left-sided heart failure.

AB: For the past decade, treatment of cattle with 0.00375% deltamethrin at =

  -weekly intervals has been part of an integrated approach to counteract
  continuous invasion of Zimbabwe by Glossina morsitans morsitans and G.
  pallidipes from the Mozambique fly-belt. To determine the effect of these
  regular deltamethrin treatments on the epidemiology of babesiosis, a surv=
ey was
  conducted to estimate the prevalence of antibodies against Babesia bigemi=
na in
  adult communal cattle. The seroprevalence of antibodies against B. bigemi=
na in
  adjacent areas, where cattle are treated with short-residual acaricides, =
was
  also determined for comparison. The prevalence of antibodies to B. bigemi=
na was
  much higher in areas where dipping with a non-pyrethroid acaricide was
  conducted. This was attributed to the successful control of Boophilus spp=
. and
  hence a very low level of Babesia bigemina transmission in the 'deltameth=
rin
  treatment zone'. This low level of disease transmission was confirmed by =
the
  low prevalence of antibodies against B. bigemina in sentinel cattle that =
were
  introduced to the 'deltamethrin treatment zone'. The potential adverse ef=
fects
  of severely reducing the tick population should be taken into considerati=
on at
  the onset of tsetse control operations in which cattle are to be treated =
with
  deltamethrin at short treatment intervals.

AB: Muscidifurax raptorellus was studied in a high-rise poultry facility in
  Pennsylvania, USA, in 1997. M. raptorellus was released in the form of
  parasitized Musca domestica pupae at 3 densities in the pit of the poultr=
y
  house, and the emergence of F1 and F2 progeny from spatially referenced f=
ield
  -collected and laboratory-reared sentinel hosts was recorded over a 10-we=
ek
  period. Laboratory-reared hosts were parasitized more than field-collecte=
d
  hosts. Although dispersal reached 6 m from the release points, parasitoid
  emergence reduced after 2 m. It is concluded that the limited dispersal
  indicates that Muscidifurax raptorellus should be released in a more targ=
eted
  manner, aimed particularly at late Musca domestica instars in accumulated
  manure.

AB: The accumulation of larval trematodes by Ilyanassa obsoleta at 2 estuar=
ine
  sites in Delaware, USA, was studied. Initial infection status was assayed=
 by
  looking for shed cercariae. Native snails (most already infected) were de=
ployed
  at sites A and B, and sentinel snails (putatively uninfected) were deploy=
ed at
  site B. All were individually marked and, if found, reassessed for infect=
ion
  after being free for 1-3 summers. Himasthla quissetensis, Lepocreadium
  setiferoides, Zoogonus rubellus, Austrobilharzia variglandis and Gynaecot=
yla
  adunca infections were observed in recovered snails. At site A in 1993, 6=
2
  natives were recovered. Among the 26 initially testing uninfected, 15 had
  infections at recovery. Of 36 that released cercariae, 26 had the infecti=
on
  initially indicated. Of sentinels released at site B in 1996, 3 of 16 had
  infections when recollected. One probably was infected before transplant;=
 at
  least 2 were infected at site B during 1996-1997. Among site B natives, 2=
6 were
  later examined by dissection in 1996; 22 had the infection status initial=
ly
  revealed. Some site B natives (n=3D35) escaped recapture in 1996 but were
  reexamined in 1997 and/ or 1998, most by cercarial release; the same cerc=
ariae
  were produced by 30. Among natives (both sites, n=3D123), 27.6% exhibited=
 some
  difference in infection status compared to the initial assay. However, mo=
st
  differences can be discounted as cases where initial infection status was
  misrepresented.

AB: Seven field releases of Trichogramma ostriniae and T. nubilale were mad=
e
  separately and in combination in a sweetcorn [maize] field in Massachuset=
ts,
  USA, to compare the level of parasitism in sentinel eggs of the European =
corn
  borer, Ostrinia nubilalis. The results indicated that the levels of egg
  parasitism among different release dates differed mainly because of chang=
es in
  weather and plant architecture within the season. The level of egg parasi=
tism
  by releasing T. ostriniae alone was 15% higher than that by releasing T.
  nubilale alone, and 20% higher than by releasing both species. Further an=
alyses
  using the logistic regression model for independent and correlated data
  indicated T. ostriniae to be more efficient at discovering host egg masse=
s and
  to have higher levels of egg parasitism than T. nubilale. Mutual interfer=
ence
  between T. ostriniae and T. nubilale was the main factor for the lower le=
vel of
  egg parasitism when T. ostriniae and T. nubilale were released together. =
The
  results suggest that T. ostriniae is the better candidate for augmentativ=
e
  releases for control of the European corn borer, and the two species shou=
ld not
  be released into a maize field at the same time.

  Trialeurodes vaporariorum and the tetranychid Tetranychus urticae was ass=
essed
  in the laboratory and in a tomato greenhouse in British Columbia in 1998.
  Adults of D. hesperus fed readily on both pest species in the laboratory,=
 and
  nymphs completed development from egg to adult, but Trialeurodes vaporari=
orum
  was a superior food for growth and development. The development time of D=
.
  hesperus was shorter and the resulting adult body size was larger for nym=
phs
  reared on Trialeurodes vaporariorum compared to those reared on Tetranych=
us
  urticae. When released in a greenhouse, adults oriented to and oviposited=
 on
  Trialeurodes vaporariorum-infested sentinel plants but did not orient to
  Tetranychus urticae-infested sentinel plants. Adults of D. hesperus ovipo=
sited
  on greenhouse tomatoes and their progeny completed development in a green=
house
  in which both Trialeurodes vaporariorum and Tetranychus urticae were pres=
ent.
  The use of D. hesperus for the biological control of pests of greenhouse
  vegetables is discussed in the light of the results.

AB: Mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus) a small-sized sentinel fish, has been
  proposed for use in environmental effects monitoring programs conducted b=
y pulp
  mills that release their effluent in marine waters. In order to evaluate =
the
  suitability of mummichog as a sentinel species and to support the
  interpretation of biological effects data, tissue concentrations of
  polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans, (PCDD/Fs), chlorophe=
nolic
  compounds (CPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and chlorinated pestic=
ides
  were investigated in mummichog sampled in the Miramichi Estuary, which wa=
s
  receiving a bleached-kraft mill (BKM) effluent, and in a reference estuar=
y, the
  Bouctouche Estuary. Higher concentrations of PCDD/Fs (up to 50 times), CP=
s (up
  to 60 times), DDT, and PCBs (up to 10 times) were found in mummichog samp=
led at
  the upstream site of the Miramichi Estuary, New Brunswick, Canada. At thi=
s
  site, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin toxic equivalent concentrations=
 were
  slightly above the threshold for ethoxy resorufin O-deethylase induction.
  Multivariate analyses on congener profiles revealed that the contaminatio=
n by
  PCDD/Fs and CPs originated both from the BKM and from a former wood
  -preservation plant and that PCDD/Fs and CPs typical of the BKM were
  transported 40 km downstream from the mill. Patterns and levels of persis=
tent
  contaminants differed between sites within the Estuary, indicating that t=
he
  fish did not mix during their growing period. These findings support the =
use of
  mummichog in environmental effects monitoring programs, because this spec=
ies
  bioaccumulates chlorinated compounds contained in BKM effluent and is
  sedentary. The cause-effect relationship between exposure to the BKM effl=
uent
  and the observed biological responses will have to be demonstrated by
  laboratory studies because of the presence of multiple sources of contami=
nation.

  cytokine bioassays were collected at 0 h, every hour until PIH 6, every 2=
 h
  until PIH 12, and every 6 h until PIH 24. Differences in plasma NO
  concentrations across time were not apparent. Urine NO concentrations
  significantly decreased at 4 and 20 to 24 h in endotoxin-treated horses.
  Significant alterations in clinical signs and haemodynamic, metabolic and

AB: A long-term field study (60 consecutive weeks in 1996-97) was conducted=
 to
  determine whether a B. annulatus population could be eradicated through
  repeated applications of a 1% pour-on formulation of fipronil on cattle h=
eld in
  an infested pasture in Texas, USA. Animals treated repeatedly over time (=
seven
  applications) were infested with significantly fewer (P<0.05) female tick=
s (5
  mm in size) than untreated animals in all except 1 of the 57 weekly tick =
counts
  conducted after the 1st treatment was applied. As the number of treatment=
s
  increased over time, there was a progressive decrease in the number of
  instances in which engorging females were observed on the treated cattle.=
 Tick
  numbers obtained from sentinel cattle placed in pasture with untreated an=
d
  treated cattle at various intervals throughout the study indicated that a
  single fipronil treatment had no observable adverse effect on the field t=
ick
  population. However, after 2 treatments had been applied, there were alwa=
ys
  dramatically fewer ticks obtained from sentinel animals placed with treat=
ed
  cattle than were observed on sentinel animals placed with untreated cattl=
e.
  Furthermore, tick numbers obtained from sentinel cattle placed with treat=
ed
  cattle over time indicated that the tick population in the pasture declin=
ed by
  stages. While a single treatment had no effect on the tick population, th=
e
  application of 2-4 fipronil treatments at various intervals dramatically
  reduced the tick population, even though substantial numbers of females w=
ere
  still present on the sentinel animals. Ultimately, the application of 5-7
  fipronil treatments resulted in an extremely low tick population in the
  pasture, although total eradication of the population was not achieved du=
ring
  the study. The mean weight gain of treated animals was significantly high=
er
  (P<0.05) than untreated animals during the study, indicating that the fip=
ronil
  treatments had a highly beneficial impact on weight gain production.

AB: The circumstances of 2 cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in north
  Queensland in 1998 are described, including 1 acquired on the Australian
  mainland. Serological surveillance of sentinel pigs for JE virus activity=
 and
  serological surveys of humans and pigs and viral cultures of mosquito
  collections were undertaken. The study was conducted on islands in the To=
rres
  Strait and in communities in the Northern Peninsula Area (NPA) and near t=
he
  mouth of the Mitchell River in Cape York, Queensland, in the 1998 wet sea=
son
  (December 1997-May 1998). Sentinel pigs in the Torres Strait began to
  seroconvert to JE virus in February 1998, just before onset of JE in an
  unvaccinated 12-year-old boy on Badu island. By mid-April, most sentinel =
pigs
  had seroconverted. Numerous JE viruses were isolated from Culex annuliros=
tris
  mosquitoes collected on Badu. In early March, a person working at the mou=
th of
  the Mitchell River developed JE. Serological surveys showed recent JE vir=
us
  infection in 13 young pigs on a nearby farm, but not in 488 nearby reside=
nts.
  In NPA communities, sentinel pigs seroconverted slowly and JE viruses wer=
e
  isolated from 3, but none of 604 residents showed evidence of recent infe=
ction.
  Nucleotide sequencing showed that 1998 JE virus isolates from the Torres =
Strait
  were virtually identical not only to the 1998 isolate from an NPA pig, bu=
t also
  to previous (1995) Badu isolates. It was concluded that JE virus activity=
 was
  more widespread in north Queensland in the 1998 wet season than in the 3
  previous wet seasons, but ecological circumstances (e.g. less intensive p=
ig
  husbandry, fewer mosquitoes) appear to have limited transmission on the
  mainland. Nucleotide sequencing indicated a common source for the 1995 an=
d 1998
  JE viruses. Circumstantial evidence suggests that cyclonic winds carried
  infected mosquitoes from Papua New Guinea.

  of filth flies distinct from that generally reported for cattle confineme=

  the USA. Twenty-two feedlots were surveyed using freeze-killed sentinel h=

  fly pupae. Parasitism averaged 0.25%. Ten species of hymenopterous parasi=
toids
  were recovered. As a percentage of the total number of pupae parasitized,=
 these
  species were Muscidifurax raptor (37.4%), Trichomalopsis sarcophagae (23.=
9%),
  Urolepis rufipes (18.5%), Muscidifurax zaraptor (6.9%), Nasonia vitripenn=

  (Ichneumonidae), Dibrachys cavus (0.1%) (Pteromalidae), Synacra sp. (0.1%=
)
  (Diapriidae), and an unidentified Braconidae (0.1%). No differences were
  detected among natural regions of the province. Three categories of seaso=
nal
  activity were identified which expand on previous groupings of species by=
 their
  geographic distributions. The abundance of T. sarcophagae and rarity of s=
pecies
  of Spalangia are in marked contrast to results of surveys conducted in th=
e USA.
  This difference suggests that species used to manage populations of pesti=
ferous
  flies associated with livestock in the USA could be inappropriate for use=
 in
  Canada.

AB: A field trial in Zimbabwe investigated the efficacy of insecticide-trea=
ted
  cattle as a barrier to prevent the re-invasion of G. morsitans and G.
  pallidipes into cleared areas. The original tsetse barrier consisted of
  insecticide-treated odour-baited targets, at an operational density of 4-=
5
  targets per km2, supported by insecticide-treatments of cattle with eithe=
r
  deltamethrin dip (Decatix) at 2-weekly intervals, or deltamethrin pour-on
  (Spoton) at monthly intervals, in a band _20 km wide from the reinvasion =
front.
  Tsetse catch, and trypanosomiasis incidence in 9 sentinel herds was recor=
ded
  for 7-8 months, respectively, before the targets were removed, leaving on=
ly the
  insecticide treatment of the local cattle to stem the re-invasion of tset=
se.
  After the removal of the target barrier, the tsetse readily invaded the t=
rial
  area and the incidence of trypanosomiasis in sentinel herds increased, wh=
ile
  their packed cell volumes decreased. After 7 months without the targets i=
n
  place, trypanosomiasis prevalence in the local stock had reached alarming=
ly
  high levels; the trial was terminated prematurely and the target barrier =
re
  -deployed. Immediately after the re-deployment of the target barrier, the
  tsetse catch in the trial area reverted to acceptable levels along the re
  -invasion front, and trypanosomiasis incidence in the sentinel cattle
  decreased. It is concluded that, under the conditions of the field trial,=
 the
  insecticidal treatment of local cattle did not in itself form an effectiv=
e
  barrier to tsetse re-invasion. By contrast, the target barrier performed =
as was
  predicted by mathematical and experimental analysis, and readily cleared =
the
  tsetse infestation and reduced trypanosomosis incidence in the trial area=

AB: The vacuum regulator maintains a constant vacuum in a milking machine b=
y
  controlling the amount of air that enters the system. If the level of the
  vacuum is too high, the regulator will allow more air to enter, while if =
the
  vacuum level is too low, it will close slightly to allow less air in. The=
re are
  3 main types of vacuum regulator: weight-based, spring-based and membrane
  -based. The 3rd type (also known as diaphragm-based or servo-regulators) =
are
  the most precise and reliable. Among the brands mentioned are the Sentine=
l,
  Westfalia, BouMatic, Surge and Alfa Laval regulators. Each regulator has =
a
  maximum capacity, and so when installing a bigger vacuum pump, it is impo=
rtant
  to ensure that the capacity of the regulator exceeds the output of the pu=
mp by
  20%. Regulators should maintain a stable vacuum in the milk reception cha=
mber
  (receiver), with the vacuum varying by <0.6 in Hg (2 kPa). The vacuum reg=
ulator
  is always installed between the vacuum pump and the sanitary trap, but wi=
ll
  operate most efficiently if the vacuum is measured as close to the sanita=
ry
  trap as possible. It is also important to minimize friction between the
  regulator and the reception chamber, and to clean the regulator regularly=

AB: The results of recently completed trials in Africa of insecticide-treat=
ed
  bed nets (ITBN) offer new possibilities for malaria control. These experi=
mental
  trials aimed for high ITBN coverage combined with high re-treatment rates=
.
  Whilst necessary to understand protective efficacy, the approaches used t=
o
  deliver the intervention provide few indications of what coverage of net =
re
  -treatment would be under operational conditions. Varied delivery and fin=
ancing
  strategies have been proposed for the sustainable delivery of ITBNs and r=
e
  -treatment programmes. Following the completion of a randomized, controll=
ed
  trial on the Kenyan coast in 1993-95, a series of suitable delivery strat=
egies
  were used to continue net re-treatment (with permethrin) in the area. The=
 trial
  adopted a bi-annual, house-to-house re-treatment schedule free of charge =
using
  research project staff, and resulted in over 95% coverage of nets issued =
to
  children. During the year following the trial, sentinel dipping stations =
were
  situated throughout the community and household members informed of their
  position and opening times. This free re-treatment service achieved betwe=
en 61
  -67% coverage of nets used by children for 3 years. In 1997, a social mar=
keting
  approach, that introduced cost-retrieval, was used to deliver the net re
  -treatment services. The immediate result of this transition was that
  significantly fewer of the mothers who had used the previous re-treatment
  services adopted this revised approach and coverage declined to 7%. The f=
uture
  of new delivery services and their financing are discussed in the context=
 of
  their likely impact upon previously defined protective efficacy and cost
  -effectiveness estimates.

 s.c. or

LA: English
AB: A randomised study of the effect of insecticide spraying on diarrhoea
  incidence was undertaken. 6 study villages were randomly assigned to 2 gr=
oups.
  Flies (98% Musca domestica) were controlled by deltamethrin application i=
n
  group A in 1995 and in group B in 1996. In 1997 the effectiveness of bait=
ed fly
  traps was tested in group A villages. Diarrhoea episodes were monitored i=
n
  children under 5 years through mothers' reports during weekly visits by a
  health visitor. Fly density was monitored by use of sticky fly-papers hun=
g in
  sentinel compounds. During the fly seasons (March-June) of both 1995 and =
1996,
  insecticide application practically eliminated the fly population in the
  treated villages. The incidence of diarrhoea was lower in the sprayed vil=
lages
  than in the unsprayed villages in both 1995 (mean episodes per child-year=
 6.3
  vs. 7.1) and 1996 (4.4 vs. 6.5); the reduction in incidence was 23% (95% =
CI 11
  -33, P=3D0.007). At times other than the fly season there was no evidence=
 of a
  difference in diarrhoea morbidity between sprayed and unsprayed villages.=
 Fly
  density data for 1997 indicate the ineffectiveness of baited traps in thi=
s
  setting. It is concluded that fly control can have an impact on diarrhoea
  incidence similar to, or greater than, that of the interventions currentl=
y
  recommended by WHO for inclusion in diarrhoeal disease control programmes=
 in
  developing countries.

  cases and 11 deaths in humans. The abundance of blood-fed and gravid C.

  site in Indian River County, for the 3 years before the epidemic, the epi=
demic
  year, and for 1 year following the epidemic. Each study year was divided =
into
  four 3-month periods that depict the subtropical SLE transmission cycle; =
a
  January-March maintenance phase, an April-June amplification phase, a Jul=
y
  -September early transmission phase, and an October-December late transmi=

  phase. The abundance of blood-fed and gravid females was significantly gr=

  during the amplification, early transmission and late transmission phases=
 of
  the 1990 SLE epidemic when compared with the 3 pre-epidemic years. Throug=
hout
  the study, C. nigripalpus blood feeding and oviposition was driven by epi=
c (>50
  mm) rainfall events. The abundance of gravid females decreased, whereas t=
he
  number of blood-fed females increased following heavy rainfalls. Epizooti=
c and
  epidemic transmission of SLE to sentinel chickens and humans in Indian Ri=
ver
  County was greatest immediately following heavy rainfalls that synchroniz=

  IHA and RIP. The results showed that the natural rates of infection [with
  Yersinia pestis] based on F1 antibody were 5% and 12%, respectively. The
  positive rate of the RIP was higher than that of IHA (CHI2 =3D 8.06, P<0.=
01). The
  GMT were 1:109.6 and 1:609.1, respectively. F1 antibody by RIP was detect=
ed in
  different periods, but F1 antibody by IHA was only detected in the period=
 of
  epizootic plague occurrence. It is suggested that pigs be used as a senti=
nel
  animal in domestic rat plague foci.

  areas in the Atlantic Forest region, Sao Paulo State, Brazil, for 3-day p=
eriods
  between 1974 and 1981. These included 5 isolates of Maguari, one of Kairi=
 and
  one of Tucunduba virus. This was the first time that bunyaviruses have be=
en
  detected in Sao Paulo State. The isolates were identified by haemagglutin=
ation
  and complement fixation in suckling mice. The results showed that these v=
iruses
  belonged to the Bunyamwera serogroup. There have been reports of human di=
sease
  caused by viruses belonging to this serogroup in Brazil and it is possibl=
e that
  these viruses may be transmitted to man in Sao Paulo State.

these
  fossil acorns demonstrated that Q. hiholensis conforms to genus Quercus
  (Fagaceae), subgenus Quercus, section Quercus (the white oaks). It is con=
cluded
  that the correspondence of Q. hiholensis to the modern section Quercus
  indicated that the derived floral and fruit characters that distinguish t=

AB: The National Status and Trends Mussel Watch data for 1997 were used to
  compare the distribution of parasites (helminths and protozoa) between se=
ntinel
  bivalves of the East, West, Gulf and Great Lakes coasts of the USA and to
  assess the relationship of parasitism to contaminant body burden. Overall=
, 5
  patterns dominated the geographical distribution of the parasite fauna: (=
1)
  certain parasites, such as Nematopsis, were principally associated with o=
ysters
  from the southeast and Gulf coasts; (2) discounting Nematopsis, oysters a=
nd
  mussels did not differ significantly in total parasite infection intensit=
y; (3)
  West coast mussel populations were always lower in infection intensity th=
an
  East coast mussels and rarely showed anything but a sporadic pattern of
  infection; (4) East coast mussels typically had a focus of infection in t=
he
  Boston Harbor region; (5) with the exception of Nematopsis, mussels on th=
e West
  coast, Mytilus edulis and M. californianus, did not differ significantly =
in
  their parasite fauna. The geographical distributions of most parasites an=
d
  disease-causing organisms varied independently. Any 2 parasites rarely co
  -occurred predictably over wide areas and never on more than one coast. C=
ertain
  contaminants were correlated with certain parasites on one coast but not =
the
  other or in one bivalve type but not another. Significant relationships w=
ere
  observed between parasitism and contaminant body burden most often in Eas=
t and
  Gulf coast oysters and West coast mussels and, in most cases, higher body
  burdens were associated with lower infection intensities. Statistics that
  emphasized prevalence also identified significant relationships most ofte=
n in
  East and Gulf coast oysters and West coast mussels. In contrast to infect=
ion
  intensity, most significant results occurred because parasites were obser=
ved
  more often in locales characterized by higher contaminant body burdens. I=
n no
  case was a parasite/contaminant pair significant for both infection inten=
sity
  and prevalence.

  Chest X-ray revealed bilateral interstitial changes in the mid and lower =
lung
  zones and serological tests showed antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus. W=
ipe
  samples from the patient's desk showed A. fumigatus, Penicillium and Muco=
r spp.
  Office-related hypersensitivity pneumonitis was diagnosed. The patient's
  symptoms resolved while she was away from work, but recurred and worsened=
 when
  she returned. Eventually the patient returned to work at a different site=
 and
  has remained symptom-free for >4 years. A questionnaire survey was conduc=
ted at
  the building where the patient had originally worked. Building co-workers
  demonstrated substantially higher symptom rates than did controls in 5 ot=
her
  buildings, although no further cases of disease were identified. It is li=
kely
  that moisture sources in the building included an oversized cooling syste=
m and
  below-grade moisture, but the building met all applicable regulations and
  standards.

  zone of Tanzania. Seroconversion rates of 20%, 13%, 9%, 7% and 3% in shee=
p and
  goats were recorded in Ngorongoro, Monduli, Hai, Arumeru and Simanjiro
  districts, respectively. The low profile and insidious nature of the rind=
erpest
  virus involved caused very mild disease in cattle in some of these area i=
n late
  February to May 1997. The mild signs associated with this outbreak of
  rinderpest resulted in difficulty in its diagnosis. The presence of rinde=
rpest
  antibody in sheep and goats served as a valuable and effective indicator =
of the
  rinderpest outbreak in cattle.

TI: Hoarding of animals: an under-recognized public health problem in a
  difficult-to-study population.

536,

SO: Public-Health-Reports. 1999, 114: 1, 81-87; 11 ref.
PY: 1999
LA: English
AB: The objective of this study was to better characterize the problem of
  hoarding, or pathological collecting, of animals. Data from a convenience
  sample of 54 case reports from 10 animal control agencies and humane soci=
eties
  across the USA produced between 1992 and 1996 were analysed. Most (76%) o=
f
  hoarders were female, and 46% were 60 years of age or older. About half o=
f the
  hoarders lived in single-person households. The animals most frequently
  involved were cats, dogs, farm animals and birds. The median number of an=
imals
  per case was 39, but there were 4 cases of more than 100 animals in a
  household. In 80% of cases animals were reportedly found dead or in poor
  condition. Prevalence estimates extrapolated from these data range from 7=
00 to
  2000 cases annually in the USA. It is concluded that public health author=
ities
  should recognize that animal hoarding may be a sentinel for mental health
  problems or dementia, which merit serious assessment and prompt intervent=
ion.
  It is suggested that improved cooperation between humane societies and pu=
blic
  health authorities could facilitate the resolution of animal hoarding cas=
es.

AB: The efficacy and stability of an E2 subunit vaccine against classical s=
wine
  fever virus (CSFV) was investigated. The vaccine, which contains E2 produ=
ced in
  insect cells by a baculovirus expression vector is a potential marker vac=
cine,
  as it allows discrimination between infected and vaccinated pigs. Several
  vaccination-challenge experiments were used to assess the dose that prote=
cts
  95% of the vaccinated pigs (PD95), and to measure the stability and effic=
acy of
  the vaccine several months after production. A single vaccination with 32=
 =B5g
  E2, the estimated PD95, in a water-oil-water adjuvant prevented clinical =
signs
  and mortality due to a CSFV challenge 3 weeks after vaccination. Virus
  transmission to susceptible sentinel pigs was prevented in nearly all gro=
ups of
  pigs vaccinated with this dose. The vaccine was stable for at least 18 mo=
nths,
  and retained its full potency. These findings indicate that the E2 marker
  vaccine merits further investigation for suitability for use in a control
  programme during an outbreak of CSF.

  Herds were studied between 1993 and 1995. The herd at the Al-Ahsa oasis
  (Eastern region) showed evidence of Akabane viral activity, by the presen=

  maternal (colostral) antibody. The levels of antibody decreased to
  insignificant levels by the time the calves were 5 months old. There was =
no
  evidence of subsequent seroconversion. The other 2 sentinel herds gave no
  indication of Akabane viral activity.

  and OvMBP/29) to determine the endemicity of Onchocerca volvulus infectio=
n in
  hyper, meso, and hypoendemic communities was investigated in Cameroon.
  Parasitological parameters of infection prevalence and intensity were com=
pared
  with serological results. Infection prevalence by serology was consistent=
ly but
  not significantly higher than that defined by parasitology. Differences b=
etween
  the communities defined by microfilarial load and a measurement of Onchoc=
erca
  volvulus-specific antibody levels (serological index [SI]) were similar. =
When
  stratified by age, differences were more significant in the younger age g=
roups.
  If a sentinel population of individuals aged 5-15 years was used to compa=
re
  communities, all could be equally ranked by serological and parasitologic=
al
  parameters. The SI of the sentinel population gave a better distinction b=
etween
  each community than the SI of the whole and it is suggested that it would=
 be
  sufficiently sensitive to measure the changes in endemicity that would be
  required for onchocerciasis control programs.

AB: The effects of an education programme (area II) on transmission of
  Echinococcus granulosus from dogs to sheep in Wales, UK, and of substitut=
ion of
  the education programme by a 6-weekly anthelmintic control programme (are=
a I)
  were compared with the situation in an area where no control intervention=
s had
  occurred (area III). The education programme failed to prevent transmissi=
on of
  E. granulosus to sentinel lambs examined at 15 months of age, 6, 4 and 10=
% of
  which were infected in areas I, II and III, respectively. Educational eff=
orts
  did, however, show some positive effects; for example, significantly more
  farmers (87-98%) in areas I, II, and III used praziquantel to treat their=
 dogs
  compared with 39% of farmers in a lowland area in the east of England whe=
re E.
  granulosus is absent (P<0.0001). In particular, the interval between trea=
tments
  of dogs was significantly shorter in areas targeted with education progra=
mmes
  (P<0.0001), and 38% of farmers in area I treated dogs at a 4-6-week inter=
val,
  as did 17% in area II and 10% in area III, compared with only 3% in the l=
owland
  area. Also, more dogs in Wales (65-88%) were treated at an interval of _3
  months, whereas most of the dogs in the lowland area (64%) were treated a=
t
  intervals of _6 months. It is suggested that the shorter treatment interv=
als
  with praziquantel may account for the significantly fewer positive coproa=
ntigen
  tests among dogs in area I (6.3%) and area II (5.6%) compared with area I=
II

AB: A total of 480 million females of the egg parasitoid Trichogramma minut=
um
  was aerially released on 30 ha of boreal forest infested by Choristoneura
  fumiferana in Ontario, Canada, on 15 and 22 July 1993. T. minutum were re=
leased
  in parasitized eggs of the factitious host, Ephestia kuehniella. Emergenc=
e of
  released T. minutum peaked at 80%, 5 days after the releases. Sentinel eg=
g
  masses in the release plots were actively attacked by T. minutum up to 15=
 days
  after the 1st release. The mean rate of parasitism of egg masses by T. mi=
nutum
  was 68% in 3 treatment plots versus <2% in the control plots. The reducti=
on in
  host density in the treatment plots from egg parasitism by T. minutum was
  maintained in the overwintering 2nd-instar larvae of C. fumiferana (Octob=
er
  1993) and for the 6th-instar larvae sampled in June 1994. Additional foli=
age
  protected in the treatment plots was between 37 and 51%. The rate of para=
sitism
  by the early-instar parasitoid Apanteles fumiferanae declined after the
  reduction of budworm populations in the treatment plots. In contrast,
  parasitism by a late larval tachinid complex, consisting primarily of Win=
themia
  fumiferanae [Omotoma fumiferanae] and Lypha setafacies, increased in the
  treatment plots. It is concluded that aerial inundative releases with T.
  minutum can provide effective short-term population suppression of C.
  fumiferana and significant foliage protection.

AB: Cocoons of Cotesia plutellae were released for nine consecutive weeks a=
long
  the margins of two commercial cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. bravo L.) f=
ields
  near Bunnell, Flagler Co., Florida, in spring 1996. The larval parasitism=
 of
  diamond back moth, Plutella xylostella, by C. plutellae and by the native
  parasitoid Diadegma insulare, was evaluated in release fields and in near=
by
  cabbage fields using two methods - sentinel collard (B. o. var. acephala)=
 or
  sentinel cabbage plants and non-sentinel plants. Total parasitism of diam=
ond
  back moth larvae on sentinel plants in the release and adjacent fields wa=
s
  35.7%. There were no significant differences in the level of parasitism b=
y C.
  plutellae among sentinel plant locations within the release fields. In no=
n
  -release fields, parasitoids spread as far as 1500 m from the nearest rel=
ease
  site during the release period, but parasitism of larvae on sentinel plan=
ts
  decreased as the distance from the release area increased. Parasitism of
  diamond back moth larvae by D. insulare was 8.3% in C. plutellae release =
and
  adjacent fields, but 14.6% in nearby fields. Sampling of non-sentinel cab=
bage
  plants for diamond back moth larvae demonstrated a total of 37.4% larval
  parasitism by C. plutellae in the release and adjacent fields, similar to=
 that
  recorded on sentinel plants. However, C. plutellae were detected only as =
far as
  800 m from the release site on non-sentinel cabbage plants, and total
  parasitism in the dispersal fields was also very low. D. insulare contrib=
uted
  only 1.1% parasitism of larvae sampled from non-sentinel plants in all ca=
bbage
  fields. C. plutellae was more effective than D. insulare in attacking dia=
mond
  back moth larvae in this study where field populations of diamond back mo=
th
  were low (<0.1 larva per cabbage plant).

land,
  New Zealand, in early autumn, winter, spring and summer from March 1992 t=

  April 1994. A wide range of anthelmintic programmes in all age groups, wi=
thin
  farms between years and between farms was recorded. Weaner deer received =
3 to 9
  treatments in their first year. Many farmers treated older deer in only o=
nce
  during the study period. Older stags were treated more often than younger
  stags. Oxfendazole, ivermectin and moxidectin were the most commonly used
  anthelmintics. Egg and larval counts varied between farms and between yea=
rs,
  but a higher proportion of deer shed larvae than eggs. In winter the numb=
er of
  weaners shedding eggs was the same as in autumn, but fewer shed lungworm
  larvae. Egg and larval counts in older stags and hinds were highest in ea=
rly
  spring, and counts were higher in yearling stags than in adult stags. Wea=
ning
  weight was negatively correlated with higher faecal larval count index an=
d
  positively correlated with the number of anthelmintic treatments before
  weaning. Weaners grew faster in spring after late winter anthelmintic tre=
atment
  than those without treatment or with later treatments. There were inverse
  relationships between both farm mean weaner and adult serum pepsinogen an=

AB: An outbreak of diarrhoea spanning 3 months occurred in a breeding colon=
y of
  scid/Trp53 knockout mice. Approximately a third of the 150 mice were clin=
ically
  affected, with signs ranging from mucoid or watery diarrhoea to severe
  haemorrhagic diarrhoea with mortality. H. bilis and H. rodentium were iso=
lated
  from microaerobic culture of faeces or caecal specimens from affected mic=
e.
  Dual infection with H. bilis and H. rodentium were confirmed by culture a=
nd
  polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in several animals. Both Helicobacter spe=
cies
  rapidly colonized immunocompetent sentinel mice exposed to bedding from c=
ages
  containing affected mice, but the sentinels remained asymptomatic. Mice w=
ith
  diarrhoea had multifocal to segmental proliferative typhlitis, colitis, a=
nd
  proctitis. Several affected mice had multifocal mucosal necrosis with a f=
ew
  focal ulcers in the caecum, colon, and rectum. Mice with diarrhoea were t=
reated
  with antibiotic food wafers (1.5 mg of amoxicillin, 0.69 mg of metronidaz=
ole,
  and 0.185 mg of bismuth/mouse, daily) previously shown to eradicate H.
  hepaticus in immunocompetent mice. Antibiotic treatment resulted in resol=
ution
  of diarrhoea, but not eradication of H. bilis and H. rodentium; mice cont=
inued
  to have positive PCR results after a 2-week treatment regimen, and clinic=
al
  signs of diarrhoea returned in some mice when treatment was suspended. It=
 is
  concluded that H. bilis and/or H. rodentium can be an important pathogen =
for
  scid mice.

AB: African swine fever was reported for the first time in the Cote d'Ivoir=
e on
  16 April 1996, in Abidjan, and resulted in the death of 135 000 pigs, abo=
ut 29%
  of the pig population, of which 80% came from the commercial sector. By
  November, the outbreaks had stabilised and were then eliminated. All
  epidemiological evidence showed that the active form of disease ceased in
  September 1996. A variety of factors were responsible for limiting and th=
en
  halting spread of the disease from the end of August 1996, including a ne=
w
  strategy which gave priority to local information, better control of the
  situation, depopulation of the infected area in Abidjan, the epidemiologi=
cal
  containment of most cases within the villages, and also the assistance an=
d
  direct involvement of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the =
United
  Nations. The contribution of the FAO was decisive. It provided an assessm=
ent of
  the situation, recommended emergency measures, developed a control strate=
gy,
  ensured the implementation of the control programme, set up a diagnostic
  laboratory unit and provided training for staff, slaughtered and destroye=
d any
  remaining pigs, set up and implemented a local information programme, dev=
eloped
  and implemented a scheme for sentinel animals and for epidemiological
  surveillance, and designed, performed and analysed an epidemiological sur=
vey.
  From the start of the epizootic, two major shortcomings became apparent
  inadequate dissemination of information, and a shortage of technical reso=
urces
  allocated for the control of African swine fever. These two shortcomings =
were
  compounded by other technical and socio-economic constraints.

  were collected in the area by 2 collection methods in 1995 and virus isol=
ation
  was conducted on ticks in 1995 and 1996. I. ovatus was found to be the
  predominant tick species in the area; there were also small numbers of I.
  tanuki, I. persulcatus and Haemaphysalis flava. In 1996, 2 virus strains =
were
  isolated from 600 I. ovatus ticks (300 females and 300 males), giving the
  minimum infection rate of 0.33% (2 of 600). The 2 virus strains were iden=
tified
  as TBE virus by antigenic analysis using monoclonal antibodies and the in=
direct
  immunofluorescent antibody test. The results showed that I. ovatus was a
  suspected vector of the emerging TBE virus in Hokkaido.

  dispersal and survival of A. funestus and A. gambiae s.l. during the rain=
y
  season in 1990. Blood fed, resting mosquitoes were collected indoors, mar=

  with fluorescent powder and released on the same day from 2 different sit=
es in
  the study area. For 2 weeks indoor resting mosquitoes were collected from=
 11
  houses in the release area. Additional collections were made with a light=
 trap
  from a sentinel house in the centre of the study area. A. funestus was mo=
re
  abundant than A. gambiae s.l. Of 4262 A. funestus and 645 A. gambiae s.l.
  released, 4.3% and 7.4%, respectively, were recaptured. Dispersal of mosq=
uitoes
  was not random: 1 of 3 areas was favoured significantly more than the oth=
er
  areas, as shown by the recapture and movement rates of marked mosquitoes.=
 Based
  on the regression of the recapture rate, estimated daily survival rates o=
f A.
  funestus and A. gambiae s.l. were 0.63 and 0.78, respectively. These were
  significantly different. The differences in dispersal and survival rates
  between the 2 species are discussed in view of local topography and speci=

AB: The Olestra Post-marketing Surveillance Study (OPMSS) monitored consump=
tion
  patterns of olestra-containing snacks and determined whether consumption
  affected nutritional state. The OPMSS combined repeated cross-section, ra=
ndom
  -digit dial telephone surveys before and after the market release of oles=
tra
  -containing foods as well as intensive dietary and clinical assessments o=
n a
  subsample of survey participants. Data were from baseline telephone (n=3D=
1962)
  and clinical (n=3D1069) assessment of subjects (aged 18 to 74 years) in t=
he
  Marion County, Indiana, USA. Mean age of participants in the telephone su=
rvey
  was 43.2 years; 19% of respondents were black and 29% had completed colle=
ge.
  Analyses examined associations among savory snack use, fruit and vegetabl=
e
  consumption and demographic and health-related characteristics. Data from=
 the
  telephone survey were adjusted to be representative of the Marion County
  population. Almost 96% of the population surveyed had eaten savory snacks=
 in
  the month before the survey: 74% had eaten regular-fat, 26% fat-reduced a=
nd 78%
  non-fat types. Total snack consumption did not differ by gender, educatio=
n or
  race. Residents younger than 35 years ate snacks 16 times a month compare=
d with
  12 times a month among older residents. Types of snacks consumed differed
  markedly by demographic characteristics. Male, younger and less educated
  residents are more regular-fat snacks; female, white and college-educated
  residents ate more non-fat snacks. Subjects practicing healthy behaviour,
  including not smoking, eating fruit and vegetables and exercising, also a=
te
  fewer regular-fat and more non-fat snacks. Fat intake was also related li=
nearly
  to use of snack foods, ranging from 33.2% of energy among those consuming=
 1
  serving per month or less to 36.8% among those consuming 20 or more servi=
ngs
  per month. Procedures for recruitment and nutrition assessment appear ade=
quate
  for evaluating the impact of olestra consumption on nutritional state. Th=
ere is
  potential for relatively high olestra consumption, given that almost 35% =
of
  Marion County residents eat snack foods at least 20 times a month. Consum=
ers
  eating at least 20 servings of snacks per month derived more than 12% of =
total
  energy and fat from snack foods, which suggests that substituting olestra
  snacks could substantially reduce fat and energy intake.

AB: The contamination of human milk with organochlorine residues was assess=
ed
  and compared through 2 sentinel practice networks in Lower Saxony, a stat=
e of
  former West Germany, from July 1992 to June 1993, and Saxony-Anhalt, a st=
ate of
  former East Germany, from January to June 1995. Sociodemographic, lifesty=
le and
  exposure factors were determined by questionnaire in 156 primiparous, bre=
ast
  -feeding women from Lower Saxony and 113 from Saxony-Anhalt during a regu=
lar
  screening examination 4-6 weeks postpartum. Human milk samples were analy=
sed
  for hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), hexachlorbenzole (HCB), DDT, dieldrin,
  polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and heptachlorepoxid (HCE); half the samp=
les
  were also analysed for dioxin. Analytic statistics were computed using mu=
ltiple
  logistic regression. In Lower Saxony all but 2 human milk samples were we=
ll
  below the tolerable concentrations established by the German Research Cou=
ncil
  (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)). In Saxony-Anhalt no participant =
had
  concentrations above those recommended by the DFG. After adjustment for a=
ge of
  mother and child, occupational and non-occupational pesticide contact, DD=
T and
  beta-HCH concentrations were significantly lower in Lower Saxony and HCE =
and
  dieldrin concentrations were lower in Saxony-Anhalt. There were no differ=
ences
  between the 2 states for PCB, HCB, gamma-HCH and dioxin. Human milk
  contamination levels in former Saxony-Anhalt exceeded the contamination i=
n
  Lower Saxony only for DDT and beta-HCH.

AB: The development of A. hagenowii in irradiated 2-week-old Periplaneta

  clutches than freeze-killed oothecae, but per clutch the number of female=
s and

 In
  parasitoid development studies, ootheca age and the factor clutch signifi=
cantly
  affected the number of female and male parasitoids per clutch: younger oo=
thecae
  yielded more parasitoids than older oothecae. Weekly for 30 weeks (23 Jun=
e 1993
  -19 January 1994), parasitoids were released in P. americana, P. australa=
siae
  and P. fuliginosa-infested treeholes [in Florida, USA]. Parasitism of sen=
tinel
  oothecae at release sites was higher than at control sites each week afte=
r the
  release programme was initiated. From April to November, parasitism of se=
ntinel
  oothecae in control treeholes was 10-40%, but peaked at 46% the week of 7=
 July.
  Weekly winter (December-March) sentinel ootheca parasitism was <10%. Para=
sitism
  of sentinel oothecae in release treeholes remained higher for 10 of the 1=
1
  weeks after parasitoid releases were terminated, indicating that naturall=
y
  occurring oothecae, parasitized during the release programme, served as
  inoculum for subsequent generations of parasitoids.

AB: A tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) patient has not been reported for many =
years
  in Japan, although a serological survey of domestic animal sera suggested=
 the
  presence of TBE foci in Hokkaido. In October 1993 in Hokkaido, a severe
  encephalitis case in a farmer's wife was diagnosed as tick-borne encephal=
itis.
  Serological examination of paired sera showed a rise of neutralization an=
tibody
  titre to Russian spring summer encephalitis (RSSE) virus. A
  seroepizootiological survey of dogs in 1994 showed that the TBE-related v=
irus
  was prevalent in the area. Three virus isolates were obtained from the bl=
ood of
  sentinel dogs in 1995 and the antigenic analysis grouped the isolates int=
o TBE
  -related viruses. Sequence analysis of the envelope protein gene identifi=
ed one
  of the isolates as the same subtype as RSSE virus. The results provide ev=
idence
  that TBE is endemic in certain areas of Japan.

AB: The control of onchocerciasis, and the impact of Mectizan (ivermectin)
  treatment on community microfilarial load (CMFL) in Uganda are discussed.=
 A few
  years of annual treatment with Mectizan reduced the CMFL in sentinel vill=
ages
  in Uganda by 52-100%; the greatest reductions (100%) were observed in vil=
lages
  with the lower CMFL pre-treatment levels. It is suggested that assessment=

  intervals of less than one year should help to show how quickly skin clea=
red by
  Mectizan is re-invaded by microfilariae and indicate the frequency of tre=
atment
  required to produce the greatest benefits.

AB: Individual PCBs and chlorinated pesticides (CHLPs) were determined in w=
ater,
  suspended particles (SPM), sediments, and Asiatic clams (Corbicula flumin=
ea) to
  study their bioaccumulation kinetics and evaluate the usefulness of clams=
 as
  sentinel organisms. Bioaccumulation depended on the routes of uptake and
  bioavailability which were influenced by compound hydrophobicity. CHLPs w=
ere
  mainly present in the dissolved phase, showed a positive correlation betw=
een
  the bivalve-water BAF and Kow, and reached steady-state concentrations be=
fore
  70 days in a caging experiment. These results reflected an efficient wate=
r-gill
  partitioning process. In contrast, PCBs were only detected in the SPM, sh=
owed
  essentially Kow-independent bivalve-sediment and bivalve-SPM BAF with the
  lowest values for superhydrophobic heptachlorobiphenyls 174, 180, and 170=
, and
  did not reach steady-state concentrations during a 140-day exposure perio=
d.
  This suggested that uptake was hindered by their stronger affinity for SP=
M and
  the interference of steric factors during intestine absorption. C. flumin=
ea are
  reliable sentinel organisms and showed clear geographical trends along 15=
0 km
  of the Rio de La Plata coast: a progressive decrease of PCB concentration=
s and
  more degraded patterns dominated by recalcitrant congeners, i.e. 153, wer=
e
  observed with increasing distance from the major La Plata-Buenos Aires ur=
ban
  centre. A size-related trend overlapped with this spatial gradient: older=
 clams
  usually showed higher concentrations and a more degraded PCB signature. C=
HLPs
  showed less clear geographical trends due to the presence of multiple sou=
rces.
  CHLP patterns showed a strong dominance of chlordane-related compounds,
  particularly trans-chlordane which was 2-5 times more abundant than the c=
is
  isomer. On a temporal scale, from 1986 to 1993, C. fluminea presented sus=
tained
  PCB concentrations but showed a significant decrease of chlordane and DDT=
,
  which suggested reduced inputs in recent years.

  cabbages were planted. Captures of P. xylostella and T. ni males in traps

  were conducted to determine the functional response of Trichogramma ostri=

  to its host, eggs of the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis, under
  different conditions. Individual trichogrammatids were offered different

were
  carried out in a sweet corn [maize] field that was divided into 6 plots o=
f
  equal size (120 m2). Sentinel egg masses of O. nubilalis were exposed to =
T.
  ostriniae for 3 days, from day 0 to 3 and day 4 to 7 after release. Both =
the
  laboratory study and field experiments indicated that egg parasitism was
  positively correlated with egg density. However, this relationship differ=
ed
  significantly for the 3 temperatures in the laboratory study and varied
  considerably for the different days of exposures (days 0-3 versus days 4-=
7) and
  for different replicates (time of the year). The Gompertz equation and a
  modified disc equation were fitted to the laboratory data categories base=
d on
  temperature. The results showed that female T. ostriniae might exhibit th=
e type
  II or type III functional response depending on temperature. The field da=
ta
  suggested a type II functional response when data were pooled for all

AB: In an outbreak of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) in nude mice histopatholo=

  findings provided a presumptive diagnosis, but results of serological tes=
ting
  of affected nude mice and immunocompetent sentinels were negative. Result=
s of
  transmission electron microscopy of liver specimens from affected mice we=
re
  equivocal. Diagnosis was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase ch=
ain
  reaction (RT-PCR), using primers with nested sequences directed to 2 sepa=
rate
  but highly conserved regions of the MHV genome. This procedure detected M=
HV in
  the liver of an affected nude mouse and in a sentinel, although in the se=
ntinel
  a positive result was obtained only because of the increased sensitivity =
of
  nested primers used in a second round of amplification. Virus was not det=
ected
  in cell lines injected into the mice, and the source of the outbreak was =
not
  found. These results indicate the applicability of RT-PCR for detecting M=
HV in
  the field while also showing that conventional, complementary techniques =
are
  still essential in diagnosis. It is recommended that specimens should be =
taken
  for histological examination and serological testing, as well as for mole=
cular
  studies when MHV infection is suspected.

ted in
  a 300 km2 area in the Eastern Province of Zambia, that is highly cultivat=

  with a cattle density of about 8 cattle/km2, between 1989 and 1991. Targe=
ts
  were deployed in suitable tsetse habitats along roads and tracks. The eff=
ect of
  the targets on the tsetse population and on the transmission of tsetse
  -transmitted trypanosomiases was monitored by means of man-walked fly rou=
nds
  and sentinel herds, respectively. The apparent density of tsetse in the t=
rial
  area and in adjacent areas, declined rapidly after targets had been deplo=
yed.
  Trypanosomiasis incidence in the trial area decreased significantly but d=

  in controlling Glossina m. morsitans in highly cultivated areas even when
  deployment is restricted to suitable tsetse habitat. It is suggested that

  suggested the presence of TBE foci in Hokkaido. Studies were conducted to=
 prove
  the presence of an endemic focus of TBE virus in Japan by means of serolo=
gy and
  virus isolation. In October 1993 in Kamiiso, Hokkaido, a severe case of
  encephalitis in a dairy farmer's wife was diagnosed as TBE. Serological
  examination of paired serum specimens showed a rise in the neutralization
  antibody titre to Russian spring summer encephalitis virus. A
  seroepizootiological survey of dogs showed that the TBE-related virus was
  prevalent in the area. Three virus isolates were obtained from the blood =
of
  sentinel dogs, and antigenic analysis grouped the isolates into TBE-relat=
ed
  viruses. Sequence analysis of the envelope protein gene identified one of=
 the
  isolates as being of the same subtype as the Russian spring summer enceph=
alitis
  (Far Eastern TBE) virus. The results provide evidence that TBE is endemic=
 in
  Hokkaido. The EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ accession number for the new nucleotide
  sequence is AB001026.

AB: The early induction of interleukin (IL)-12 is a critical event in
  determining the development of both innate resistance and adaptive immuni=
ty to
  many intracellular pathogens. Previous in vitro studies have suggested th=
at the
  macrophage (MPHI) is a major source of the initial IL-12 produced upon
  microbial stimulation and that this response promotes the differentiation=
 of
  protective T helper cell 1 (Th1) CD4+ lymphocytes from precursors that ar=
e
  primed on antigen-bearing dendritic cells (DC). Immunolocalization experi=
ments
  and flow cytometric analysis were used to show that, contrary to expectat=
ion,
  DC and not MPHI are the initial cells to synthesize IL-12 in the spleens =
of
  mice exposed in vivo to an extract of Toxoplasma gondii or to
  lipopolysaccharide, 2 well characterized microbial stimulants of this cyt=
okine.
  This production of IL-12 occurs very rapidly and is independent of interf=
eron
  -gamma priming or of signals from T cells, such as CD40 ligand. IL-12
  production by splenic DC is accompanied by an increase in number of DCs, =
as
  well as a redistribution to the T cell areas and the acquisition of marke=
rs
  characteristic of interdigitating dendritic cells. The capacity of spleni=
c DC
  but not MPHI to synthesize de novo high levels of IL-12 within hours of
  exposure to microbial products in vivo, as well as the ability of the sam=
e
  stimuli to induce migration of DC to the T cell areas, argues that DC fun=
ction
  simultaneously as both antigen-presenting cells and IL-12 producing acces=
sory
  cells in the initiation of cell-mediated immunity to intracellular pathog=
ens.
  This model avoids the need to invoke a 3-cell interaction for Th1
  differentiation and points to the DC as both a sentinel for innate recogn=
ition
  and the dictator of class selection in the subsequent adaptive response.

AB: Predators of Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata (CPB)) a=
re an
  important component of CPB suppression by biological control in New Jerse=
y
  (USA) aubergine fields. The results of a preliminary study on the effects=
 of
  strip-insectary intercropping with flowers on predator abundance and CPB
  suppression in experimental aubergine fields are reported. Strip-insectar=
y
  intercropping with flowers is known to increase beneficial insect survivo=
rship,
  fecundity and retention and crop pest suppression in agroecosystems. Howe=
ver,
  little is known about the compatibility of predator foraging ability with
  floral architecture, i.e., the spatial relationship of the nectary with o=
ther
  floral parts. This is a critical factor in the selection of 'proper' flor=
al
  host plants, i.e., those having pollen and nectar that is accessible to
  predators. Laboratory evaluations and field observations of the foraging
  performance of Coleomegilla maculata and Chrysoperla carnea on flowers wi=
th
  disparate floral architectures indicated that dill (Anethum graveolens) a=
nd
  coriander (Coriandrum sativa) had floral architectures that were compleme=
ntary
  to the head morphology and foraging behaviour of these representative CPB
  predators. To measure the effect of strip-insectary intercropping with 'p=
roper'
  flowers on CPB suppression, the fate of 120 egg masses and resultant larv=
ae
  placed on individual sentinel aubergine plants was followed during two 9-=
day
  periods in 100 m X 40 m aubergine fields intercropped with two rows of ei=
ther
  dill or coriander and in a flowerless control field. In addition, coccine=
llid
  species richness and abundance was censused weekly in each test field fro=
m
  early July to mid-August. Throughout this study, the numbers of coccinell=
ids
  observed during each census were significantly higher in the fields
  interplanted with dill and coriander than in the flowerless control field=
.
  Although there were no differences among treatments in the number of hatc=
hed
  CPB egg masses, significantly more CPB egg masses were consumed in the di=
ll
  -intercropped fields than in the control field. Survivorship of CPB larva=
e at
  the end of each survey was highest in the control field and lowest in the=
 dill
  field. These results suggest that strip-intercropping with proper flowers=
 can
  greatly enhance CPB predator conservation and augmentation in vegetable
  cropping systems.

AB: Predation on eggs of the codling moth, Cydia pomonella, was assessed in
  Washington in June and August 1995 in eight apple orchards treated with
  organophosphate insecticides (OPs), four orchards treated with mating
  disruption (MD) and some OPs, and four treated with MD but not with OPs.
  Sentinel codling moth eggs oviposited by caged moths on 10 shoots in each
  orchard were scored as alive, dead, or missing after 7 days, and beating =
tray
  samples of arthropod predators were collected at the beginning and end of=
 each
  trial. Levels of egg predation (dead + missing eggs) did not differ
  significantly among orchard types in June but varied among orchard types =
in
  August (MD alone > MD + OPs > OPs). The percentage of dead eggs in August=
 was
  significantly higher in orchards receiving only MD than in orchards treat=
ed
  only with OPs. The percentage of missing eggs was significantly lower bot=
h
  months in orchards not treated with MD. Densities of spiders [Araneae] an=
d all
  predators on both sample dates, and earwigs [Dermaptera] in August, were
  significantly higher in orchards not treated with OPs. Densities of
  heteropteran predators did not vary significantly by orchard type. No
  significant correlations were found among predator densities and egg mort=
ality
  within an orchard type. However, the percentages of dead eggs and dead pl=
us
  missing eggs were significantly and positively correlated with densities =
of
  earwigs, spiders, and all predators in tray samples across the 16 orchard=

AB: Different Shin-Etsu twist-tie rope formulations, containing the pheromo=
ne of
  either Helicoverpa armigera or Pectinophora gossypiella, or both, in the =
same
  rope, were tested in Israel for mating disruption. The success of mating
  disruption in cotton was evaluated by the mating table technique, compari=
ng the
  percentage of mating of virgin sentinel females in pheromone-treated and
  control plots. Two variants of this technique were evaluated, one with tw=
o
  mating tables per plot, each containing 5-7 females, and the other with 6=
-8
  mating tables per plot, with only one female per table. The latter method=
 was
  more sensitive than the former, particularly at low population densities.=
 Two
  tests were conducted in 1995 in order to compare a blend of five componen=
ts of
  H. armigera pheromone with a blend of two components for mating disruptio=
n. The
  application consisted of 2000 ropes/ha, each with 80 mg pheromone. Evalua=
tion
  by the two mating table methods showed clearly that the formulation conta=
ining
  two components was superior to the five-component blend for mating disrup=
tion,
  suppressing mating almost completely for 49 days. A new combined formulat=
ion,
  HPROPE, containing 175 mg of the H. armigera two-component blend and 65 m=
g of
  P. gossypiella pheromone, was tested in 1996 for mating disruption of bot=
h
  pests. Application of 625 ropes/ha caused a high level of suppression of =
mating
  of H. armigera females for at least 94 days and that of P. gossypiella fe=
males
  for 161 days. The pheromone release rates were ca. 625 mg/day per ha for =
H.
  armigera and 162 mg/day per ha for P. gossypiella. A 'long-life' formulat=
ion of
  P. gossypiella pheromone, PBW rope L, applied at 125 ropes/ha, releasing =
137
  mg/day per ha, achieved complete suppression of mating over 75 days. This
  release rate of P. gossypiella pheromone was much lower than that current=
ly
  used in Israel (275 mg/day per ha). These results indicate that mating of
  females of two moth pests with different pheromones can be disrupted by o=
ne
  combined formulation.

AB: An investigation was carried out to validate previous laboratory result=
s in
  a field study. Slugs were collected from an abandoned Cu mine (Parys moun=
tain
  top, PMT), from a site 7 km away from the mine (Parys mountain bottom, PM=
B),
  and from a clean site (Snowdonia Cwm Idwal, SCI) in Wales (UK) in early J=
uly
  1994. Whole soft body and digestive gland Cd, Cu, and Zn concentrations w=
ere
  measured by means of atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). The diges=
tive
  gland was the main tissue for metal accumulation, with significant differ=
ences
  in tissue metal levels between samples from different sites. PMB presente=
d the
  highest Cd and Zn levels and the highest Cu levels were found at PMT. In
  addition, metals were demonstrated in situ by autometallography as black =
silver
  deposits (BSD) on histological sections of digestive gland tissue. The ex=
tent
  of BSD within lysosomes of digestive cells was closely related to metal l=
evels
  determined by AAS. Histochemistry showed that Ca metabolism and structura=
l and
  reserve connective tissues might be altered in slugs living in metal-poll=
uted
  soils. Finally, tissue-level biomarkers of biological effect [mean epithe=
lial
  thickness (MET), mean diverticular radius (MDR), mean luminal radius (MLR=
),
  MET/MDR and MLR/MET] were quantified by image analysis of digestive gland
  histological sections stained with haematoxylin-eosin. MET and MDR values=
 of
  slugs collected from SCI were high, while slugs from PMB presented low ML=
R/MET
  associated with environmental stress induced by metal exposure. It was
  concluded that exposure and effect biomarkers recorded in sentinel slugs =
could
  be sensitive, quick, and cheap indices of metal pollution in soils. A Slu=
g
  Watch monitoring programme could be developed similar to the Mussel Watch
  programme, which is currently applied to assess environmental quality in
  coastal and estuarine areas.

AB: Many environmental problems contain incomplete data in the initial or
  boundary conditions. How do we solve problems for which some of the initi=
al
  and/or boundary conditions are unknown? Using a new technique, the sentin=
el
  method, this book answers these questions and others as they pertain to i=
nverse
  problems in environmental pollution, such as pollution of underground and
  surface waters, thermal pollution, and air pollution. This guide explains=
 how
  to solve inverse problems, where incomplete data causes difficulties, by
  measuring pollution concentration at a few points and, using the sentinel
  method, locate and identify pollutants, calculate the quantity of polluta=
nt
  discharged, detect crises early, and more. This book also explains how to
  extend the method to other situations. Describes effective and efficient
  methods of solving important environmental problems. Explains how to appl=
y the
  sentinel method to a wide range of situations. Emphasizes real-world
  applications, particularly identification of pollutants in aquatic system=
s.
  Includes numerous problems and examples.

  antibodies was evaluated with the serum virus neutralization test and the
  competitive g1 + ELISA. Positivity in all sites was 93.67%. The breeding =

  was medicated with antibiotics in the feed to prevent the presentation of
  opportunistic infections. To control the outbreak, the breeding herd was
  vaccinated with a killed virus vaccine with a glycoprotein gl deletion ag=
ainst
  AD. This vaccination was repeated 21 days later, and the following year. =
Every
  pig in the breeding herd was vaccinated every three months. The second ye=
ar
  after the outbreak, vaccination was applied to all animals in the breedin=
g herd
  every four months. To control and eliminate AD, gilts and boars were plac=
ed in
  site 1 for a 6-month period. During the outbreak, piglets were weaned (21=
 days
  of age) and sent to a facility outside the system. When signs of AD
  disappeared, the piglets were weaned at 18 days of age and segregated to =
site
  2. Methods applied to site 1 (vaccination, segregation rearing, closing t=
he
  site and medication) were effective to control and eradicate AD in the sy=
stem.
  There has not been any case of the disease in sites 2 and 3 since the pro=

  in southern Ontario (Canada) from 1985 to 1989 were tested for antibodies=
 to B.
  burgdorferi using an indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) staining method.
  Samples from 150 of the deer were also tested using an ELISA. At IFA titr=
es of
  1:64 and 1:128 deer with antibodies to B. burgdorferi appeared to be wide=
spread
  throughout southern Ontario, with an apparent prevalence ranging from 3 t=
o 47%.
  At IFA titres _1:256 and ELISA titres _1:160 deer with antibodies to B.
  burgdorferi were only present on Long Point which is the only known endem=
ic
  focus of Ixodes scapularis, the primary vector for B. burgdorferi, in sou=
thern
  Ontario. At these titres the apparent prevalence of antibodies to B.
  burgdorferi on Long Point was only 5 to 7%, even though the mean intensit=
y of
  infestation of adult I. scapularis on deer was >180, and 60% of the adult=
 ticks
  are infected with B. burgdorferi. It is concluded that white-tailed deer =

  Valley fever (RVF) virus. In addition, a longitudinal study was carried o=

ere
  tested for haemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies and positive sera were
  further screened, using the plaque reduction neutralisation test. Of 2255
  samples, 259 (11.5%) had haemagglutination-inhibiting and neutralising
  antibodies, as follows: pigs (0%), sheep (18.7%), goats (10.4%), cattle
  (10.2%), horses (9.8%) and dromedaries (3.3%). The highest prevalence of =
RVFV
  antibody was found in the plateau area (18.4%). Animals aged 3 years or m=
ore
  had a higher prevalence of antibodies to RVFV. Longitudinal studies showe=
d
  seroconversion to RVFV in 10 of 210 animals which were kept under observa=
tion
  (4.8%). All seroconversions occurred during the wet season. The results o=
f this
  study indicate that the infection of animals with RVFV is widespread in N=

LA: English
AB: Since 1992, efforts have been made to combat onchocerciasis in Guatemal=
a
  through mass distribution of ivermectin. The impact of the campaign is as=
sessed
  by taking skin-snips from sentinel groups within selected communities. Th=
is
  method gives an estimate of the prevalence and intensity of infection, an=
d thus
  the efficacy of the treatment. In some communities people are becoming
  reluctant to volunteer for skin-snipping, and so there is a need for an
  alternative technique that will give quantitative results. In most hypere=
ndemic
  communities in Guatemala, biting blackflies are so ubiquitous that few pe=
ople
  object to allowing 10 to 20 flies to engorge upon them. Data on the
  quantitative uptake of Onchocerca volvulus microfilariae by Simulium ochr=
aceum
  were examined before and after ivermectin distribution to see whether res=
ults
  similar to skin-snip data could be obtained. Counts of microfilariae inge=
sted
  by S. ochraceum were compared to the numbers found in skin-snips from the=
 same
  volunteers. In a group of 31 untreated infected persons, a skin-snip surv=
ey was
  positive in 20 (64.5%), whereas feeding flies (vector microfilarial uptak=
e,
  VmfU) was positive in 30 (96.8%). Post-treatment, in a sample of 58 of wh=
om 52
  (89.7%) had a history of infection, both skin-snips and VmfU were positiv=
e in
  31 (54.2%). Vector blood meals contained more microfilariae than did one =
mg of
  skin before treatment, but both recorded about equal numbers after treatm=
ent.
  When the data set was subdivided to compare samples taken at 2-3, 6-8 and=
 14-17
  months post-treatment, the effect of ivermectin was still apparent at 6-8
  months, but had virtually disappeared by 14 months post-treatment. The fl=
ies
  ingested fewer microfilariae from treated persons than was expected from =
the
  skin densities estimated by skin-snip. This effect lasted for over 8 mont=
hs,
  and it is suggested that it may indicate that ivermectin has a greater ef=
fect
  on transmission than previously suspected. It is concluded that VmfU coul=
d be
  used as an alternative to skin-snipping; the ethical implications are dis=
cussed.

AB: In 1992, sentinel squash plants treated with carbofuran successfully
  attracted and killed Anasa tristis and Acalymma vittatum emerging from
  overwintering at 5 locations in Atoka County, Oklahoma. In 1993, response=
s of
  the pests to carbofuran-treated squash trap plants and to Adios or Adios-=
AG
  attracticidal baits were compared in <1.0-ha plots of seedling cantaloupe=
,
  squash and watermelon at Lane, Oklahoma. Regardless of crop, pest populat=
ions
  were highly attracted to 'Lemondrop' squash trap plants that amounted to =
<1% of
  the total crop area. Squash trap-plants attracted an estimated 39.7, 32.4=
 and
  66.3% of the A. vittatum population, respectively, observed in fields of
  cantaloupe, squash and watermelon seedlings. In cantaloupe and watermelon=
,
  squash trap-plants attracted >90% of the estimated Anasa tristis populati=
on but
  were less effective in squash. In all cases, squash trap plants treated w=
ith
  carbofuran killed >90 and 16-37%, respectively, of the Acalymma vittatum =
and
  Anasa tristis found on the plants. Single applications of attracticidal b=
aits
  provided up to 70% Acalymma vittatum mortality for 3-5 days post treatmen=
t.
  Studies conducted in 1994 showed that significantly greater numbers of
  Coleoptera, primarily Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardii, were attracted=
 to
  'Blue Hubbard' than Lemondrop squash trap plants that were treated with
  systemic insecticides, carbofuran at 0.15 g a.i. or imidacloprid at 0.04 =
g
  a.i., and positioned in a field of watermelon. Imidacloprid was as effect=
ive as
  carbofuran, each causing >90% beetle mortality. In this study, an estimat=
ed
  46.7% of the total beetle population was attracted to the squash trap pla=
nts.
  Results from these studies suggest that minimal plantings of systemically
  treated squash can be used effectively to suppress early-season populatio=
ns of
  A. vittatum and Anasa tristis in seedling cantaloupe, squash and watermel=
on.

AB: In Pakistan, the spread of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum =
has
  been recorded by in vivo surveys carried out each year since 1977. Survey=
s
  conducted during the last decade show that P. falciparum malaria has beco=
me
  resistant to chloroquine in Pakistani and Afghan refugee populations thro=
ughout
  the country. Although RI resistance is common everywhere (with a frequenc=
y of
  30-84%), RII is less common (2-36%), and RIII resistance has yet to be
  detected. A repeated in-vivo survey in a sentinel village indicated that
  prescription of chloroquine could lead to a 15% increase in the frequency=
 of
  resistance in a single year, and similar trends were observed in other
  districts. Coinciding with the spread of resistance was a 6-fold increase=
 in
  the number of P. falciparum cases recorded nationally between 1982 and 19=
92,
  and a parallel, 5-fold increase in the number of cases recorded in the Af=
ghan
  refugee population. In the sentinel village, where resistance was measure=
d at
  71%, recrudescent infections increased the genuine incidence of new infec=
tions
  recorded at the health centre by 66%. It is suggested that ineffective
  treatment could lead to resistant infections remaining patent during the =
post
  -transmission season. There was evidence that the vector-control programm=
e
  among the refugees was still able to reduce the incidence of P. falciparu=
m
  malaria to a level that existed before the advent of resistance.

c
  haemorrhagic disease of deer virus previously undescribed in Australia. 1=
7
  isolations of this virus were made from 8 animals during the period Febru=
ary to
  May 1992. Electron microscopic studies showed the presence of orbivirus-l=
ike
  structures. Serogrouping ELISA, indirect immunofluorescence assay and the
  serogrouping plaque reduction neutralization test indicated the virus was=
 a
  member of the epizootic haemorrhagic disease serogroup. Serotype specific
  plaque reduction neutralization tests, indicated the virus was a member o=
f the
  epizootic haemorrhagic disease serogroup not previously isolated in Austr=
alia.
  Analysis of the VP3 gene confirmed this observation. Cross neutralization
  testing of the isolate with known epizootic haemorrhagic disease serotype
  viruses including endemic Australian and exotic strains identified isolat=
e
  DPP2209 as epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus serotype 1.

AB: From September to November 1995, a serological survey showed that 75% o=
f
  farms and 61.5% of sentinel calves examined were positive for antibodies =
to
  Aino virus (AIV) in the southern Okayama Prefecture, Japan. Six cases of
  congenital abnormalities were observed from November 1995 to March 1996, =
5 of 6
  cases were stillbirths at 8 to 9 months of pregnancy. There were 5 cases =
of
  cervical gryposis and 4 of arthrogryposis. One case showed a cerebral def=
ect
  and cerebellar hypoplasia. Viruses were isolated from erythrocytes and bl=
ood
  plasma from 3 sentinel calves in early October 1995, and the dates of ser=
o
  -conversion and virus isolation suggested fetal infection occurring at 3 =
to 5
  months of pregnancy. The isolates had physicochemical properties of AIV a=
nd
  cross-reacted with the JaNAr-28 strain in a neutralizing test.

AB: In the early summer of 1993, an outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) was
  reported among both humans and animals in Aswan Governorate, Upper Egypt.=
 To
  determine whether RVF infection had spread to the Nile delta region of th=
e
  country, the authors carried out a cross-sectional survey of 1181
  occupationally exposed abattoir workers (97% males; age range 10-72 years=
) in
  15 governorates of Egypt in November 1993. The overall prevalence of anti=
-RVF
  virus IgM antibody was 2% (range: 0% (7 governorates) to 10%). The highes=
t
  prevalences were in Ismailia (10%) and Sharqiya (8%) Governorates. None o=
f the
  seropositive subjects reported having experienced an episode of fever in =
the 2
  months prior to the study. The prevalence of antibody was significantly h=
igher
  (P<0.05) among workers employed in high-risk jobs such as cutting animals=
'
  throats (relative risk (RR =3D 2.24)) and handling animal parts (RR =3D 2=
.37). The
  findings suggest that abattoir workers represent a useful sentinel popula=
tion
  for surveillance of RVF.

AB: In Morocco, Fasciola hepatica is a major cause of economic losses to
  livestock producers. A 3-year epidemiological study was carried out in th=
e
  rangeland of the Middle-Atlas to determine the seasonal pattern in the
  transmission of F. hepatica and an adequate strategy of control. The infe=
ction
  was followed in sentinel sheep and the dynamics of the snail intermediate=
 host,
  Lymnaea truncatula, was monitored. High fluke burdens were recorded in bo=
th
  lambs and ewes in the autumn and winter, suggesting that transmission occ=
urred
  in late spring. Fluke burdens ranged from 1 to 302 in ewes and from 1 to =
345 in
  lambs. Infection with >200 flukes was always fatal. Snail populations
  correlated with fluke transmission as observed in the sentinel sheep.
  Evaluation of the production advantages afforded by a strategic anthelmin=
tic
  treatment showed that lambs treated with a flukicide gained 13.07 kg over=
 7
  months, whereas the control group gained only 6.67 kg over the same perio=
d. The
  mortality rates were 20 and 0% in the control and treated groups, respect=
ively.
  Similar advantages were observed in pregnant ewes. The lambing rate was
  significantly higher in the treated group (92%) than in the control group
  (76%). The average lamb birth weight was 3.5 kg in the group of treated e=
wes
  and was only 2.8 kg in the control group.

AB: Laboratory assays were used to compare the ability of commercially prod=
uced
  Trichogramma spp. to parasitize eggs of Choristoneura rosaceana in the
  laboratory and field in New York State. T. platneri parasitized more eggs=
 per
  egg mass than did T. pretiosum or T. minutum produced by either of 2
  insectaries. T. minutum produced at 1 insectary caused significantly more=
 host
  mortality by host-feeding and repiercing than by parasitism. Variation in
  parasitoid performance from different insectaries and among shipments fro=
m the
  same insectary was common. Young egg masses were more heavily parasitized=
 than
  old egg masses. Parasitism increased as the number of conspecific female
  Trichogramma spp. placed on the same host increased, but the number of eg=
gs
  parasitized per female decreased. Exposure of host egg masses to female
  Trichogramma spp. prevented additional oviposition in the same egg mass b=
y
  conspecific, ovipositionally experienced females but had no effect on
  parasitism by conspecific, ovipositionally naive females. The method used=
 to
  attach sentinel egg masses to foliage influenced parasitism rates. Moiste=
ning
  the leaf with water and adhering the egg mass to the moistened leaf had t=
he
  least impact. Inundative releases of Trichogramma spp. into an apple orch=
ard
  paralleled laboratory assays by showing greater parasitism of C. rosacean=
a egg
  masses by T. platneri than with T. minutum. However, extreme differences
  observed in field performance between the 2 species was not predicted fro=

  pomonella eggs, with 5400, 16 200 or 32 400 parasitoids/release tree. The
  higher release rates of T. platneri resulted in greater parasitism of sen=

AB: Since the advent of ecological risk assessment, there has been insuffic=
ient
  time to develop a consensus that guides its use in science-based policy
  activities. As a part of risk assessment, science and policy have been co=
mbined
  to create several myths that hold important consequences for environmenta=
l
  decision making. These myths -a "sensitive," or "sentinel," species can b=
e
  selected and appropriately used; chronic data are better suited to regula=
tory
  needs than are acute data; and controlled experimental data can be accura=
tely
  extrapolated to the field- continue because of failures to clearly distin=
guish
  between the roles and uses of science and policy. Though possibly useful =
from a
  policy perspective, these myths are not scientifically valid. Issues of
  representativeness, lack of ecological knowledge, and variability questio=
n
  their scientific foundation. Science has played an important part in deve=
loping
  assessment techniques, but it cannot address all the issues surrounding
  environmental risk management. Policy must be used to make management-rel=
ated
  decisions. Therefore, the most important role for science is the provisio=
n of
  information to be used in environmental decision making.

  samples from these sentinels were collected over a 9 month observation pe=
riod.
  16 viruses isolated from heparinised blood samples were typed by the plaq=

genies
  of imported commercial Merino-Border Leicester crossbred sheep, shown to =
be
  free of bluetongue antibodies by AGID and competitive ELISA. Although vir=

  immunodiffusion in 7 cities and counties of the Bayannur Meng of Inner Mo=
ngolia
  [Nei Menggu] in 1987. Among the samples from sheep, goats, Yellow cattle =
and
  camels, 23.2% (650 of 2799) were seropositive. This proportion was higher=
 among
  goats at 57.9% (523 of 903) and lower among sheep at 7.5% (127 of 1684), =
with
  no positive reactions found at all in camels. The seropositive sheep and =
goats
  showed no clinical signs. However, some sheep and goats in a sentinel her=
d
  showed elevated temperatures and changes in white blood cells. Through th=
e use
  of sentinel herds, bluetongue disease was found to occur under natural
  conditions in Bayannur during an epidemic period. Within the sentinel her=
d, the
  seropositive rate was 59.2%. After inoculation of embryonated chicken egg=
s and
  cell cultures as well as sheep experiments, bluetongue viruses were isola=
ted
  from sheep. These isolates were shown to be the same group as the Yunnan =

AB: From 1990 to 1995, sentinel herds have been monitored regularly at 6
  locations throughout the Northern Territory of Australia. At all sites, m=
onthly
  serology has been conducted for the bluetongue (BLU), epizootic haemorrha=
gic
  disease (EHD) and Palyam group viruses. Weekly virus isolation was also c=
arried
  out at the site of greatest arboviral activity. During the observation pe=
riod,
  5 BLU serotypes, 5 EHD serotypes, 3 Simbu serogroup viruses, one bovine
  ephemeral fever (BEF) serogroup virus and other arboviruses were isolated=
 from
  the sentinel cattle. There was marked annual variation in the total numbe=
r and
  identity of viruses isolated. Seroconversions in the sentinel herds also =
showed
  annual variation.

  virus infections of livestock. The technique, developed in Australia, has=
 since
  been introduced to New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, Malaysia, US=
A,
  Canada, Central America and the Caribbean. In 1984, sentinel herds were
  established for a Sino-Australian ephemeral fever project in northeast Ch=
ina.
  In 1991, the first sentinel group for bluetongue, a disease first recogni=
sed in
  China's Yunnan Province in 1979, was established near Kunming. The herd
  comprised 15 goats and two cattle. This paper reports the establishment a=

AB: Epidemiological studies of bluetongue viruses depend on understanding
  certain key features of the biology of the 24 serotypes. Bluetongue virus=
es are
  arboviruses, spread by insect vectors comprising some species in the genu=
s
  Culicoides. Among ruminant hosts, cattle are the major reservoir or ampli=
fier
  host, with only some breeds of sheep showing disease. Bluetongue viruses =
have
  both serotype and serogroup reactive antigens, and also show serological =
cross
  -reactions with other viruses. Serological tests must be interpreted on t=
he
  basis of this knowledge. The distribution of bluetongue viruses can be ma=
pped
  through serological surveys, but confirmation of virus presence in any ar=
ea
  requires virus isolation. Monitoring sentinel groups of animals at freque=
nt
  intervals allows both isolations and descriptions of seasonal patterns of
  seroconversions. Isolating viruses from insects allows identification of
  potential vectors, which must be confirmed by experimental transmission
  studies. Molecular virology allows comparison of sequence data from isola=
tes,
  so that the relationships between viruses in different geographical areas=
 can
  be studied. Pathogenicity does not depend on serotype, but must be tested
  experimentally to determine the potential economic problem constituted by
  viruses from a given area. The financial cost to farmers, a major conside=
ration
  in any epidemiological study, can only be determined by accurate on-farm
  records and accurate diagnosis of disease outbreaks. The application of t=
hese
  principles has been demonstrated in northern Australia and Indonesia, wit=
h good
  results. Much is now known of the distribution of the bluetongue virus gr=
oup in
  these neighbouring countries, and 8 bluetongue serotypes have been isolat=
ed
  from sentinel cattle in both countries.

AB: In Australia, bluetongue viruses have not caused outbreaks of disease i=
n
  sheep, but their presence continues to cause economic loss, especially in=
 terms
  of reduced markets for the export of live sheep, cattle, semen and embryo=
s. As
  some of the Australian serotypes of bluetongue virus (BLU) are capable of
  causing disease under experimental conditions, the sheep industry and ani=
mal
  health authorities are concerned that pathogenic BLU serotypes could ente=
r
  major sheep-raising areas. This paper describes an extensive, nationwide
  sentinel herd programme to monitor BLU epidemiology in Australia. This Na=
tional
  Arbovirus Monitoring Programme ensures the detection of any movements of
  bluetongue viruses towards the disease-free zone of southern and eastern
  Australia, and allows delimitation of virus-free zones from which animals=
 can
  be safely exported. To assist with the development of disease control
  programmes, a similar approach could be used to monitor the spread of
  bluetongue and other important vector-borne diseases in China and other
  countries.

AB: Preliminary findings on the ecology of the Phlebotominae in an area of
  coconut plantation ('municipalities' of Jitauna and Itagi) in the south o=
f the
  State of Bahia, Brazil, are presented. The study site had 60 well separat=
ed
  dwellings, and had a population of 31 dogs and 229 human inhabitants. Amo=
ng
  them, 41.5% were Montenegro positive; 37.5% from these had scars of heale=
d
  ulcers and 8.8% had active ulcers. 53% of the houses had dogs, of which 2=
2%
  were seropositive for Leishmania. Of the 7 dogs with ulcers, only 3 were
  seropositive. 14% of the inspected houses harboured sandflies inside them=
.
  During 2 years of observations, 72 sentinel hamsters were maintained in h=
ouses
  of patients with leishmaniasis ulcers, but they did not get the infection=
.
  During 2 years of observation (in 1991-92), monthly collections of sandfl=
ies
  were made inside houses, chicken pens, corrals, on tree trunks and in an =
open
  field around the house of a patient with leishmaniasis. A total of 5614
  specimens belonging to 14 different species of sandflies was identified. =
Among
  them, Lutzomyia whitmani (92%) and L. intermedia (4.8%) were the most abu=
ndant
  species. They are very anthropophilic and can be found inside houses and =
at
  peridomestic sites. Probably they are the principal vectors of Leishmania=
 in
  domestic sites. The other 12 species were less frequent and more often fo=
und in
  sylvatic places, although many also bite man. Generally, the biting activ=
ity of
  most of the species of the area begins at 17.00 h, at dusk, and reaches i=
ts
  peak at 00.00 h, when it begins declining until it disappears at 07.00.
  Lutzomyia whitmani was collected with similar densities in all lunar phas=
es,
  while L. intermedia was more abundant during the new moon phase.

AB: The status of research on gammadelta T cells is reviewed. Recent resear=
ch
  shows that gammadelta T cells may perceive antigens in an immunoglobulin-=
like
  manner and that non-peptidic substance can be antigens for these cells.
  Considerable advances have been made in defining the immunobiology of
  gammadelta T cells, with evidence for sentinel, protective and immunoregu=
latory
  roles. Research on gammadelta T cells in malaria infections suggests that
  gammadelta T cells are mediators of protective immunity, most probably th=
rough
  the production of Th1 cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alph=
a, TNF
  -delta and interferon-gamma and that excessive production of such cytokin=
es may
  contribute to pathology. Data on features of the peripheral blood gammade=
lta T
  cell response in humans infected with Plasmodium falciparum show that the=
re is
  considerable variation between individuals in the relative expansion of
  gammadelta T lymphocytes following primary or secondary infection, confir=
m that
  activation of gammadelta T cells occurs during P. falciparum infection, a=
nd
  show that activated cells can persist for many weeks after treatment. The
  possibility that gammadelta T cells have an immunoregulatory function in
  malaria infections is proposed.

AB: Trichogramma ostriniae, an egg parasitoid of Ostrinia nubilalis was rel=
eased
  into sweet corn [maize] fields in Massachusetts to study the effects of
  weather, plant size and distribution of egg masses on egg parasitism by t=
he
  wasp. Sentinel O. nubilalis eggs were stapled onto leaves located in the =
upper,
  middle and lower third of maize plants 5 to 35 m away from the wasp relea=
se
  point in either a radial or grid manner. Weather conditions and plant
  architecture were monitored during the experiments. Logistic regression w=
as
  used to analyze the data. The results indicated that percentage of eggs
  parasitized was negatively related to an increase in leaf area as well as=
 an
  increase in the distance at which eggs were located from the point of rel=
ease
  of wasps. Eggs distributed on plants at different directions from the rel=
ease
  point received different levels of parasitism. Eggs that were stapled ont=
o
  leaves in the upper third of a maize plant received much less parasitism =
than
  those on the middle and lower third of the plant. Higher mean temperature
  adversely affected the level of parasitism during hotter times of the sea=
son
  and conversely, lower temperatures (<17 =B0C) reduced the egg parasitism =
during
  cooler times of the season. The longer the exposure of eggs to wasps, the
  higher the level of egg parasitism. However, the levels of egg parasitism=
 for 2
  days' exposure were almost the same as that for 3 days' exposure due to t=
he
  limited longevity and egg-laying behavior of the wasp. These results sugg=
est
  that inundative releases of T. ostriniae should be made every two to thre=
e
  days, with multiple release points per hectare. In addition, weather cond=
itions
  and plant architecture, especially temperature, plant height and leaf are=
a must
  be taken into consideration to optimize levels of parasitism.

AB: The prevalence of Akabane virus antibodies in domestic ruminants from
  different ecological zones of Sudan was assessed. Neutralizing antibodies=
 were
  demonstrated in sheep, goats and cattle sampled between 1979 and 1980 fro=
m El
  Obeid, Nyala, Kassala, Jonglei and Sennar. The highest prevalence was in
  Jonglei where 6 of 22 sheep, 4 of 11 goats and 43 of 90 cattle had antibo=
dies
  to the virus. Although antibodies were detected in 7 of 79 dams and 11 of=
 70
  dams of two sentinel calf herds in Central Sudan at Shambat and Um Benein=
,
  respectively, none of the sentinel calves sampled between 1981 and 1983 h=
ad
  antibodies. Antibodies were subsequently detected in 8 (14%) of 57 calves=
 from
  Shambat and 5 (12%) of forty 1- to 3-year-old calves from Um Benein colle=
cted
  during 1985. The implications of these results are discussed.

AB: To identify putative persistent bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRS=
V)
  infections in cattle, 7 cattle with a history of BRSV infections were tre=
ated
  with corticosteroids for 2 periods of 5 days. During the 5-day periods an=
d the
  3 weeks after treatment, attempts were made to isolate BRSV from lung lav=
age
  fluid and nasal swab specimens. Fluorescent antibody tests were used to d=
etect
  BRSV antigen in lung lavage cells. A BRSV specific polymerase chain react=
ion
  (PCR) assay was developed, and was performed on lung lavage samples of al=
l 7
  cattle as well as on various tissues of 5 of the cattle. Nasal swabs of 7=
4 over
  -one-year-old cattle, in a closed dairy herd were also assayed by PCR. Th=
e
  virus or its RNA was not detected in putative carriers, by any of the met=
hods
  used, whereas all positive controls were positive. After corticosteroid
  treatment, 3 of the 7 cattle showed a 4-fold rise in antibody titre, sugg=
esting
  induction of virus replication. BRSV-seronegative sentinel calves, that w=
ere
  housed together with each corticosteroid-treated animal, did not develop
  antibodies to BRSV indicating that BRSV was not shed by corticosteroid-tr=
eated
  cattle, or was shed at a very low level. In addition BRSV was not detecte=
d in
  seropositive cattle in a closed farm in summer. Although the rises in ant=
ibody
  titres against BRSV were an indication for persistence of BRSV in cattle,=
 BRSV
  or its RNA was not detected in infected cattle.

rkey
  (brooder and growout) houses (15 farms) in 5 counties of North Carolina, =
USA,
  and the arthropods within the litter were recovered by using Tullgren fun=

  The most common mites were Acaridae and the trematurid Trichouropoda
  orbicularis. Predatory macrochelid mites (Macrocheles muscaedomesticae, M=
.
  merdaria, Macrocheles sp.) were collected in 45% and 49% of the litter sa=
mples
  from poultry houses in 1993 and 1994, respectively. Other predatory mites
  extracted were Fuscuropoda marginata and Cheyletus malaccensis. In additi=
on,
  110 duplicate litter samples were held with sentinel eggs of the beetle
  Alphitobius diaperinus to detect mites preying on the eggs; the mite
  Acarophenax mahunkai (Acarophenacidae) was recovered from 2 broiler house=
s and
  1 turkey house. Insects collected from the litter samples belonged to 7 o=
rders
  and 14 families. Alphitobius diaperinus was the dominant insect species a=
nd was
  found in all litter samples. The predatory histerid beetle Carcinops pumi=
lio
  was found in 59% of litter samples. The pyralid moth pest Pyralis farinal=
is
  occurred in 10% of the litter samples. Other insects identified to specie=

  ricinus, predominantly females (72%), were obtained from 47 animals (41%)=
. The
  polymerase chain reaction was used to detect DNA of B. burgdorferi s.l. i=
n a
  total of 190 ticks, comprising 106 engorged ticks and 84 non-engorged tic=
ks.
  Borrelia DNA was detected in 24 engorged ticks (23%) and 26 non-engorged =
ticks
  (31%). This difference was not significant (P =3D 0.25). Four species of =
B.
  burgdorferi s.l. were identified in the ticks: B. burgdorferi s.s., B. ga=
rinii,
  B. afzelii and group VS116. B. afzelii was most commonly found and presen=
t in
  13 mixed infections, and in 28 single infections. 15 sera (13%) contained
  antibodies to Borrelia spp. Ticks are more appropriate sentinel animals f=
or
  Lyme borreliosis than roe deer, an important host for I. ricinus. Althoug=
h the
  viability of Borrelia spirochaetes in engorged ticks collected from roe d=
eer
  was not assessed, a bloodmeal taken from roe deer did not eliminate Borre=
lia
  spirochaetes from the tick. The relevance of this finding for transovaria=

AB: The effect of nitrogen and a plant growth regulator regime (chlormequat
  chloride followed by 2-chloroethylphosphonic acid [ethephon]) on the crop
  performance of a hybrid (cv. Luchs) and a conventionally bred winter rye =
(cv.
  Sentinel) were investigated in two field experiments each year between 19=
93 and
  1995 at Winchester, UK. Internode length and dry weight/unit length of
  internodes were measured in order to assess the effect of the growth regu=
lator
  regime on stem structure. Grain yields were 15% higher in the hybrid Luch=
s than
  in Sentinel. With high levels of applied nitrogen, both cultivars lodged =
in all
  seasons and this was most severe in 1994 when 88% of the crop lodged in
  Sentinel and 52% in Luchs. Plant growth regulator treatment consistently
  reduced lodging but did not eliminate it. Reductions in lodging were not =
always
  associated with an increase in grain yield. In the hybrid cultivar, the g=
rowth
  regulator treatment reduced yield in 1993 and 1995 when 2-chloroethylphos=
phonic
  acid was applied at GS49 and GS39 respectively, but increased yield in 19=
94
  when applied at GS37. Growth regulator consistently reduced stem length, =
and
  the percentage reduction in length of the individual internodes within th=
e stem
  was strongly influenced by the timing of the 2-chloroethylphosphonic acid
  component of the PGR treatment. Growth regulator reduced internode length=
s by
  up to 25% in Sentinel and 35% in Luchs, and this was associated with redu=
ctions
  in the dry weight of internodes by up to 32% in Sentinel and 38% in Luchs=
.
  Consequently, dry weight/unit length of the stem was not increased by gro=
wth
  regulator treatment. Yield reductions in Luchs following growth regulator
  treatment may have been due to reduced stem reserves which have been asso=
ciated
  with tolerance of stress in rye. Both cultivars were highly responsive to
  nitrogen. Economic optima varied from season to season, but they ranged o=
ver
  three years, from 175 to 273 kg/ha nitrogen, and were greater than the
  currently recommended application rates. Crop lodging increased with incr=
easing
  nitrogen rate even when plant growth regulator was applied and yield pena=
lties
  from lodging would have been high, if weather conditions during grain mat=
urity
  had been unfavourable.

AB: A method for monitoring the gradual decline of a severe epidemic of mal=

  in the Haldwani district of Uttar Pradesh, India, as a result of environm=

  and chemotherapeutic control measures, is described. A total of 1407 bloo=
d
  samples was collected during 1989 to 1993 in both non-transmission and
  transmission seasons and the seroprevalence of malaria was estimated by a=
n
  ELISA using synthetic nonapeptide (R1) and cultured Plasmodium falciparum=
 (Pf)
  antigens. Antibody levels were high during the transmission season of 198=
9.
  Serological studies of a population of 143 children aged 0 to 5 years sho=
wed
  that antibody titres during the non-transmission season were low and show=
ed
  correlated with the annual parasite index (API). The API determined from =
the
  previous year's sample collection gave an estimate of the annual malaria
  exposure and corresponded with the ELISA O.D. value for the following yea=
r's
  non-transmission season. Both antigens showed a decline in antibody titre=
 in a
  sentinel population of 186 children during the non-transmission season, w=
hich
  indicated a decline in malaria. The study suggests that a peptide ELISA u=
sed
  with children may be a suitable method for measuring malaria endemicity i=

  Oncomelania snails, in 2 villages in China are presented. Chuanxing villa=
ge is
  located in a plateau basin in Sichuan Province, and Zhonghe village is lo=

  in a plateau canyon in Yunnan province. In Zhonghe the relative importanc=
e of
  the various hosts in schistosomiasis transmission were 32.8% for humans, =
60.9%
  for cattle and buffaloes and 6.3% for other domestic animals. In Chuanxin=
g the
  corresponding figures were 88.2, 11.6 and 0.2%. In Zhonghe, of the areas
  harbouring Oncomelania snails, 93.3% were rice fields, 3% were canals and=
 3.7%
  were other types of water body. Of the areas with infected Oncomelania, 9=
6.1%
  were rice fields, 3.1% were canals and 0.8% were other water bodies. In
  Chuanxing, of all the areas found to have Oncomelania snails 17.9% were r=
ice
  fields, 61.8% were canals and 20.3% were other types of water body. Rates=
 of
  infection of Oncomelania were 1.4 and 0.1% for rice fields, 0.6 and 0.16%=
 for
  canals and 0.9 and 0% for vegetable fields, respectively, in Zhonghe and
  Chuanxing. Rates of infection in sentinel mice placed in rice fields, can=
als
  and vegetable fields were 8.9, 13.6 and 23.3%, respectively, in Zhonghe, =
and
  2.9, 24.3 and 0%, respectively, in Chuanxing. It is concluded that transm=
ission
  of schistosomiasis in the 2 areas was significantly different and that co=

  the whole protocol were evaluated by ELISA. In vitro mitogenic activity o=

  was also evaluated. The results indicated: immunodominance of surface
  carbohydrate epitopes from PSC; predominant IgM and low avidity response
  against these epitopes; a dramatic increase of non-specific antibody titr=

SO: Journal-of-Parasitology. 1996, 82: 5, 830-833; 9 ref.
PY: 1996
LA: English
AB: Sentinel snails were employed to determine the likelihood of an estuari=
ne
  snail becoming infected with a trematode under natural conditions. In sum=
mers
  of 1991 and 1993, Ilyanassa obsoleta (n =3D 1400) were collected from a s=
altmarsh
  in Lewes, Delaware, USA, where parasite prevalence was low, and screened =
for
  infections. Putatively uninfected snails were individually marked and rel=
eased
  onto the nearby Cape Henlopen sandflat where prevalence of trematodes amo=
ng
  native snails is very high (_80%). Most sentinels were free in the field =
for 1
  -5 months. In 1991, 153 sentinels were ultimately recovered, 5 of which w=
ere
  infected. In 1993, 32 sentinels were recovered with none being infected.
  Overall, 5 out of 185 sentinels (2.7%) that had been free on the sandflat=
 were
  infected at recovery; 2 were infected with Himasthla quissetensis (sentin=
els
  free for 81 and 103 days), 1 with Lepocreadium setiferoides (103 days), a=
nd 2
  with Zoogonus rubellus (98 and 103 days). The overall estimate of probabi=
lity
  of infection is 1.6%. The snail lives for many years and this low probabi=
lity
  of becoming infected indicates that high prevalence of trematodes in this=
 host
  is brought about not by rapid colonization, but by slow accumulation over=
 time.

AB: Survey results are presented from 34 sentinel sites in 18 counties in
  endemic water-borne fluorosis areas of China through the years of 1991 an=
d
  1992. The progress in improving water to control fluorosis was very slow.=
 By
  the end of 1991, only 42.1% of the villages, and 39.3% of the population,=
 in
  endemic fluorosis areas had improved water supplies. In 1992 this improve=
ment
  increased by only 1%. Inspection of 987 water improvement projects to red=
uce
  fluoride showed that 82.7% were continuously used, 10.3% had interrupted =
use,
  and 7.0% had been stopped or destroyed. The projects resulted in 65.4% ha=
ving a
  water fluoride content of <1.0 mg/litre, 21.3% had 1.0-1.5 mg/litre and 1=
5.4%
  had >1.5 mg/litre. In 34 sentinel sites, urinary fluoride content and den=
tal
  fluorosis indices of 8-12 year old children decreased year by year, espec=
ially
  in the sites with longer water improvement and water fluoride content <1.=
0
  mg/litre. Symptoms and signs of adult fluorosis also decreased, but not a=
s
  significantly as the urinary fluoride content and dental fluorosis of chi=
ldren.

AB: Quantitatively spatial distribution of seroconversion of Queensland cat=

ns
  from 1990 to 1994. Seroconversion to only 2 bluetongue virus serotypes, 1=

  21, was detected. The 14 herds, in which seroconversion to bluetongue vir=
us
  serotype 1 was detected, were located only along the eastern coastal and =
sub
  -coastal region of Queensland, and were significantly (P < 0.05) clustere=
d.
  Locations at which seroconversion to serotype 21 was detected, were not
  significantly clustered. The results generally agree with field observati=
ons,
  except for the failure to detect seroconversion to bluetongue viruses in =
north
  -western Queensland. Bluetongue infection of cattle in north-western Quee=
nsland
  may be temporally sporadic. The dominance of serotype 1 in the Queensland
  cattle population may be the result of differential transmission by poten=
tial
  vector species. Long-term surveillance programmes are important for defin=
ing
  disease status of animal populations.

AB: Epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV), isolate 318 (EHDV-318), an
  untyped virus recovered from a sentinel calf herd at the Khartoum Univers=
ity
  farm in central Sudan, was characterized using molecular biological techn=
iques.
  With dot blot hybridization technique, a cDNA probe derived from genome s=
egment
  6 of EHDV-2 (Alberta strain) hybridized with RNA from EHDV-318. Applicati=
on of
  serogroup-specific EHDV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to EHDV-318 RNA
  resulted in specific amplification of a 387 bp PCR product. Amplification
  product was visualized on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel. Specifici=
ty of
  the PCR products was confirmed by chemiluminescent hybridization with a n=
on
  -radiolabelled internal probe. No amplification product or hybridization =
signal
  was detected when the serotype-specific EHDV-1 or EHDV-2 PCR-based assays=
 were
  applied to RNA from EHDV-318. These results indicate that cDNA probes and
  serogroup-specific PCR-based assay can be used to classify the virus as a
  member of EHDV serogroup, and as serotypically distinct from EHDV-1 and E=
HDV-2.

d to
  calculate a mean annual seroconversion rate. These rates were used to eva=
luate
  the annual and geographical distributions of these viruses within Florida=
. For
  SLE, the rates in counties that reported human SLE cases during a widespr=
ead
  epidemic in 1990 were compared with adjusted mean annual seroconversion r=
ates
  calculated by excluding the epidemic year seroconversion data. In general=
,
  actual rates were higher than adjusted rates in counties where human SLE =
cases
  were reported in 1990. Similar calculations were made for EEE virus that =
was
  unusually abundant in northern Florida during the spring and summer of 19=
91. In
  general, EEE virus was distributed in the panhandle and northern regions =
and
  SLE virus in the central and southern regions of the state. However, this
  distribution was not exclusive, and during years of high transmission, ei=
ther
  virus can extend beyond its normal range. The annual distribution of SLE =

AB: A regional surveillance system for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) vi=
rus
  was established in central New York, USA, in 1984 after the 2nd human EEE
  fatality occurred in 1983. Extensive mosquito surveillance activities wer=
e
  coordinated with the rapid laboratory processing of mosquito specimens fo=
r EEE
  virus. Active surveillance for EEE infections in humans and equines also =
was
  initiated. Results of long-term surveillance detected the presence of mul=
tiple
  Culiseta breeding swamps. A 6-year interepizootic period (1984-89) was fo=
llowed
  by 2 years of equine EEE. In 1990, there were 7 equine cases and a record
  number of EEE virus isolations from mosquitoes (C. melanura, C. morsitans=
,
  Aedes canadensis, A. vexans, Coquillettidia perturbans, Anopheles
  quadrimaculatus) (n =3D 86), wild birds (e.g. Melospiza melodia, Geothlyp=
is
  trichas, Dumetella carolinensis, Vireo olivaceus) (n =3D 27) and sentinel
  pheasants (n =3D 7). In 1991, seven equine cases also occurred, although =
there
  were fewer isolations from mosquitoes (n =3D 40). The sequence to the app=
earance
  of EEE virus at swamp and upland sites and at individual swamp complexes,=
 and
  the spatial and temporal distribution of equine cases, provide evidence f=
or
  multiple foci of EEE virus in central New York. The role of infected Culi=
seta
  melanura in the transfer of EEE virus between swamp and upland areas and =
among
  swamp complexes is advanced.

AB: This paper presents evidence supporting the view that in the past natur=
al
  fungal poisons (mycotoxins) in mouldy grain strongly influenced variation=
s in
  fertility and mortality rates. The poisons that influenced fertility may =
have
  reduced conceptions and increased spontaneous abortions. Those that influ=
enced
  mortality may have damaged the immune system. In particular, tuberculosis=
, the
  most common cause of death, may have been a sentinel disease for immune s=
ystem
  damage by mycotoxins. It is unlikely that any one formula (specifying the
  amounts of each predictor variable) will be found that can predict fertil=
ity
  and mortality over wide areas or long time periods. However, by using jus=
t 3
  kinds of variables - climatic, dietetic and economic - it may be possible=
 to
  predict more than half of the variation in fertility and tuberculosis mor=
tality
  up to 1900 in Europe and America. The evidence presented supports the vie=
w that
  the 2 principal factors influencing natural population increase in Connec=
ticut
  during 1660-1900 were increased consumption of potatoes and improvement i=

  mildew (Erysiphe graminis) and leaf spot (Septoria secalis [Rhynchosporiu=

AB: Three cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) occurred among residents of B=
adu
  Island in the Torres Strait (the area of ocean lying off the coast of
  Queensland, Australia) in early 1995. Although this was the first recogni=
zed
  outbreak of locally acquired JE in Australia, there were subsequent indic=
ations
  that JE was widespread at that time throughout the outer Torres Strait is=
lands.
  Strategies to minimise the risk of future cases of JE in the Torres Strai=
t were
  implemented. As a number of these strategies would take time to implement=
,
  vaccination of the population of the outer islands of the Torres Strait b=
efore
  the 1996 wet season was recommended. Vaccine was ordered, and mobile team=
s,
  each vaccinating 7 communities in the area, administered the vaccine. Sev=
eral
  clinics were established to vaccinate people who had temporarily moved aw=
ay and
  those moving to the outer islands. JE vaccine was administered to 3440 pe=
ople.
  The vaccination achieved high levels of uptake, with 93% of those who com=
menced
  the series receiving 2 or 3 doses. Ongoing surveillance using sentinel pi=
gs on
  the islands is in place to detect further incursions of the JE virus into=
 the
  Torres Strait.

AB: Pinto bean [Phaseolus vulgaris] plants were used to study the movement =
of
  chlorsulfuron aerosols and to assess the relationship among plant respons=
e,
  spray droplet spread diameter and concn of the herbicide solution. The dr=
oplets
  produced by nebulizing an aqueous solution of chlorsulfuron simulated the
  reported diameter size range of aerosols found in spray drift clouds; the
  nebulized spray was enriched in aerosols under 8 =B5m in diameter. The
  characteristic symptom used in the plant bioassays to detect chlorsulfuro=
n
  deposition was the appearance of discrete chlorotic spots on primary or
  trifoliate bean leaves. Trifoliate leaves of 3-week-old bean plants were =
more
  sensitive to chlorsulfuron aerosols than 2-week-old primary or trifoliate
  leaves. Chlorotic spots could be induced by exposure to chlorsulfuron
  -containing aerosols sprayed from a 50 p.p.b. solution. Effective movemen=
t of
  drifting aerosols likely to produce significant injury to bean plants was=
 10 m,
  but drift could be detected up to 500 m from the point of spray release. =
The
  experiments showed that sentinel plants can be used to monitor herbicide =
drift
  and deposition while providing information about potential biological eff=
ects
  on nontarget crops.

AB: A gregarious strain of M. raptorellus colonized from house fly (Musca
  domestica) puparia collected in eastern Nebraska, USA, was mass reared an=
d
  released. The study was undertaken to determine dispersal rates, persiste=
nce of
  released parasites, and optimal intervals for releasing this promising
  biological control agent for filth flies. A single release of 200 000
  parasitized house fly pupae resulted in 96% parasitism of sentinel house =
fly
  pupae 2 weeks after release. Parasite activity declined to background lev=
els
  over the subsequent 3 weeks. When 2 releases of 100 000 parasitized hosts=
 each
  were made 6 weeks apart, parasitism averaged 70% and 55%, respectively, 2=
 weeks
  after releases. When 3 releases of 67 000 parasitized hosts were made at =
4-week
  intervals, peak parasitism averaged 44%, 58% and 80%, respectively, follo=
wing
  the 3 releases. Parasite emergence from naturally occurring stable fly
  (Stomoxys calcitrans) and house fly puparia averaged 15.5% and 37.2%,
  respectively, collected during the 3-week period after each release, and =
little
  recycling was evident. Muscidifurax raptorellus is gregarious and aggress=
ive
  and can be reared at considerably less cost than solitary pteromalid spec=
ies.
  However, more study is needed to determine its potential as a biological
  control agent of filth flies.

AB: Because of the wide use of pesticides for domestic and industrial purpo=

  the evaluation of their immunotoxic effects is of major concern for publi=
c
  health. Despite the large amount of experimental data describing pesticid=
e
  -induced immunosuppression, evidence that pesticides may severely impair =
human
  functions in humans is lacking or scarce. Contact hypersensitivity is a w=
ell
  -identified immunotoxic effect of pesticides but remains a rare complaint=
 in
  pesticide-exposed workers. By contrast, immunologically mediated systemic
  reactions have been described only as debatable case reports. The associa=
tion
  between autoimmune diseases and pesticide exposure has more recently been
  suggested. Despite the lack of convincing human data, a potential risk fo=
r the
  immune system should not be excluded, especially during chronic exposure =
to
  pesticide or in otherwise (immuno)compromised patients (malnutrition, chi=
ldren,
  old patients). Epidemiological studies including markers of exposure and =
the
  assessment of immune competence in exposed individuals, or registries of
  sentinel diseases related to immunosuppression (e.g., non-Hodgkin's lymph=
oma,
  opportunistic infections) or autoimmunity (e.g., lupus erythematosus,
  rheumatoid arthritis), are warranted.

data)
  and 2 arboviruses (determined from seroconversions in sentinel cattle) we=
re
  studied in eastern New South Wales, Australia, during 1993-94. C. brevita=
rsis
  was recorded progressively from endemic areas on the north coast, to Nowr=
a on
  the south coast, and westward to Scone, in the Hunter Valley. C. brevitar=
sis
  also survived through the winter at Paterson, in the Hunter Valley. Its
  apparently focal reappearance in this marginal area had no obvious effect=
 on
  the broad pattern of its progression or the dispersal of Akabane and blue=
tongue
  viruses. These viruses were first recorded from foci near Coffs Harbour, =
on the
  mid-north coast. Their first occurrences at different locations were asso=
ciated
  with those of C. brevitarsis, but not with each other. The viruses were o=
nly
  found within the recorded limits of the vector's distribution. Delays bet=
ween
  the initial occurrence of C. brevitarsis and first evidence of transmissi=
on of
  the viruses at locations ranged from 2 to 7 months. The delays decreased =
away
  from the points of focus and were negatively associated with the time of
  initial occurrence of the vector. Seroconversions to the viruses were rel=
ated
  to the presence of C. brevitarsis. However, the densities of C. brevitars=
is had
  no apparent effect on the initial numbers of cattle seroconverting to eit=
her
  virus. The results support the conclusion that the progressions of C.
  brevitarsis and Akabane and bluetongue viruses were the result of gradual
  movements by the vector.

ic E.
  coli, or previously-known agents in new food associations such as Clostri=

  industry and government (as exists in Sweden) required to substantially r=
educe

ng the
  possible environmental consequences of hazardous waste pollution, such as

  evaluation of the usefulness of monitoring single strand breaks in coelom=
ocytes
  for assessing genotoxicity of pollutants in a coke oven area is presented=
.
  Earthworms were exposed to samples of soils obtained from the polluted ar=

  a coke oven. All samples gave a significantly higher comet tail moment th=
an
  those obtained from worms kept in laboratory conditions (standard black e=
arth =3D
  internal controls) and worms kept in soils from control areas (=3D extern=

  controls). The results showed that the comet assay applied to earthworms =
was
  very valuable for the monitoring and detection of genotoxic compounds in
  terrestrial ecosystems.

AB: M-T7, the most abundantly secreted protein of myxoma-infected cells was
  shown to be dispensable for virus replication in cultured cells but is a
  critical virulence factor for virus pathogenesis in European rabbits. Bot=
h
  copies of the M-T7 gene in myxoma virus were disrupted by deletion of 372=
 bp of
  M-T7 coding sequences, replacement with a selectable marker, p7.5Ecogpt, =
and
  selection of a recombinant virus (vMyxlac-T7gpt) resistant to mycophenoli=
c
  acid. vMyxlac-T7gpt expressed no M-T7 protein and infected cell supernata=
nts
  had no interferon-gamma binding activities. Immunohistochemical staining =
with
  anti-beta-galactosidase and anti-CD43 antibodies showed that in vMyxlac-T=
7gpt
  -infected rabbits the loss of M-T7 caused a marked reduction in clinical =
signs
  and viral dissemination to secondary sites as well as markedly affecting =
host
  leukocyte activity. Primary lesions in wild-type virus infections were
  generally underlayed by large masses of inflammatory cells that did not
  effectively migrate into the dermal sites of viral replication, whereas i=
n
  vMyxlac-T7gpt infections this apparent block to leukocyte influx was remo=
ved. A
  second major phenotypic distinction for the M-T7 deleted virus was the
  extensive activation of lymphocytes in secondary immune organs, particula=
rly
  the spleen and lymph nodes, by day 4 of the infection. Infection by wild-=
type
  myxoma virus, results in relatively little, if any, cellular activation o=
f
  germinal centers of spleen and lymph node by day 4. It is concluded that =
M-T7
  functions early in infection to retard inflammatory cell migration into
  infected tissues and to disrupt the communication between sentinel immune=
 cells
  at the site of primary virus infection in the subdermis and lymphocytes i=
n the
  secondary lymphoid organs, preventing an effective cellular immune respon=
se. It
  is suggested that M-T7 protein modifies leukocyte movement close to virus
  lesions, effectively severing the link between antigen presenting cells o=
f the
  infected tissue and the effector lymphocytes of the peripheral immune org=
ans.

  sentinels to detect atmospheric deposition of trace residues. Seedlings w=
ere
  exposed at various locations throughout south central Washington and exch=
anged
  on a weekly basis with a new set of plants. Plants were returned to a lat=
h
  house and observed over 3 weeks for development of symptoms indicative of
  probably exposure to 4 classes of herbicides (sulfonylureas, phenoxyaceta=
tes,
  aminophosphonic acids and bipyridiliniums). The most frequently observed
  symptoms on sentinel plants were chlorotic spots on the upper leaf surfac=
es;
  such symptoms were created under controlled conditions by exposing plants=
 to
  aerosols of the sulfonylurea (SU) herbicide chlorsulfuron. For 3 years, t=
he
  greatest incidence of probable SU symptoms was detected during April; how=
ever,
  occurrence of symptoms was not correlated with periods of maximum use of =
SU
  herbicides on wheat in the region. The results suggested a general atmosp=
heric
  loading of herbicides with occasional deposition, rather than point sourc=
e
  drift. Further tests are needed to quantitate the exposures of sentinel p=
lants
  and determine if chlorotic spots are associated with adverse physiologica=

ance,
  the California Department of Health Services developed a model for survei=

case
  reporting and link case reports to preventive interventions. Elements fro=
m
  surveillance of communicable diseases and sentinel health events were use=
d to
  integrate a model into the preexisting system in one agricultural county.
  During 1988-91, 45 Fresno County health care providers reported 230 suspe=
cted
  cases, of which 217 from 80 work sites met reporting guidelines. Risk fac=
tors
  were profiled from interviews of 81 prioritized case patients and 36 empl=
oyers.
  15 work sites were visited and 117 recommendations were made, of which 6%=
 were
  identified in enforcement inspections. Pest management experts consulted =
with
  growers on reducing future pesticide use. Risk factors for pesticide illn=
ess
  were prevalent. Agricultural inspectors did not detect routine and seriou=
s
  hazards. Integrated pest management should be expanded and linked to
  occupational health. Agricultural enforcement personnel should be oriente=
d and
  trained in occupational safety and health.

AB: A commercial competitive ELISA was evaluated with serial serum samples
  collected from 10 sentinel herds of cattle in Queensland, Australia durin=
g
  1994. Diagnosis of infection during the observation period was based on a=
 serum
  neutralization (SN) test titre of at least 1.8 to any one of 8 bluetongue=
 virus
  serotypes known to exist in Australia. Using the inhibition value of 40%
  recommended by the manufacturer to classify cattle as exposed to bluetong=
ue
  virus, the ELISA was highly sensitive (100%; 95% confidence interval, 77.=
9
  -100%) and moderately specific (86.4%; 95% CI, 77.0-93.0%), relative to t=
he SN
  test. An inhibition value of 70% maximized both sensitivity (100%; lower =
95%
  CI, 77.9%) and specificity (93.2%; 95% CI, 85.2-98.0%) of the ELISA. The =
chance
  (post-test probability) of an animal from which a serum sample had an
  inhibition value of 70% or more in the ELISA developing an SN titre of at=
 least
  1.8 was 93.6% (95% CI, 86.4-97.9%). Investigations of the temporal develo=
pment
  of ELISA and SN reactions, showed that the ELISA detected exposure to
  bluetongue virus significantly earlier than the SN test. The bluetongue E=
LISA
  is a useful test in surveillance programmes. False positive assay results=
 make
  it inappropriate for monitoring and diagnosis, unless it is used in conju=
nction
  with the SN test.

AB: Muscidifurax zaraptor was released at 3 rates in 9 beef cattle feedlots=
 in
  eastern Nebraska, USA, to measure dosage response. Dosage response was me=
asured
  by the percentage parasitism of sentinel Musca domestica pupae. Releases =
were
  made from a single location near the centre of the pen at 3 feedlots, fro=
m 2
  locations within the pen at 3 feedlots and from 4 corners of the pen at 3
  feedlots. One-time releases initiated field propagation of Muscidifurax
  zaraptor using freeze-killed house fly pupae as hosts. 3 treatment rates,
  averaging 4480, 20 300 and 37 100 parasitoids, were released weekly over =
a 15
  -week period with each of the 3 release methods receiving a low, medium, =
or
  high treatment rate. All 9 release sites produced significantly higher le=
vels
  of parasitoid emergence and sentinel host mortality than sentinel hosts a=
t 2
  control facilities. The 3 sites receiving the high treatment rate average=
d 38%
  host mortality, compared with 26% for the medium treatment rate and 17% f=
or the
  low treatment rate. The 2 control sites averaged 2% host mortality. No
  significant differences could be detected in the number of release statio=
ns
  except at the 4-station method using the low treatment rate. High tempera=
tures
  during at least 2 of the weekly periods were detrimental to the released

s
  from eastern Nebraska, USA, was evaluated in the field for its potential =
as a
  biological control agent for Musca domestica and Stomoxys calcitrans.
  Muscidifurax sp. was released at 3 beef cattle feedlot pens, 3 times at 3=
-week
  intervals at 50 000, 100 000 or 200 000 parasitized hosts per treatment. =
Mean
  host mortality in sentinel house fly pupae reached 94% 2 weeks after the =
1st
  release, but parasitism decreased to 72% after 3 weeks. Similar trends we=
re
  observed with the 2nd and 3rd releases. Also, large numbers of parasite p=
rogeny
  were recovered from sentinel cohorts, suggesting that many of the release=
d
  parasites found the sentinel pupae. Parasitism by Muscidifurax sp. was
  substantially lower, 27.4 and 12.2%, respectively, in naturally occurring=
 house
  fly and stable fly pupae than that observed in sentinel hosts. Little
  correlation was evident between mean host mortality and a given parasite
  release rate. This Muscidifurax sp. has a high reproductive capacity, is =
easily
  reared, and appears to be one of the more effective species commercially
  available for fly control on midwestern beef and dairy cattle confinement=

AB: In a study to determine whether recurrence of clinical signs of chlamyd=
iosis
  in asymptomatic but recently infected cats is vaccine related, 4 SPF, C.
  psittaci antibody-negative cats (< 1 year old) and 4 serologically positi=
ve
  cats (2-6 years old) were inoculated s.c. with 10X the dose of modified l=
ive C.
  psittaci vaccine. The 2 groups were housed separately with seronegative,
  unvaccinated sentinel cats. All cats remained bright and appetent, and no
  significant ocular changes were seen during 11 days after inoculation. C.
  psittaci was not isolated from conjunctival swabs taken during the 11-day
  follow-up, and none of the sentinel cats seroconverted. Transient submand=
ibular
  lymph node swelling occurred in both groups; the enlargement was slightly
  greater in the seronegative group. Thus no increase in vaccination reacti=
ons or
  provocation of the disease associated with previous exposure was demonstr=
ated.
  In a second study to assess the ability of the vaccine to cause clinical
  disease when administered locally into the eye, 3 cats all developed clin=
ical
  disease typical of infection with wild strains of Chlamydia after small d=
oses
  of vaccine were inoculated directly on to the conjunctival surface of the=
 eye.
  Positive conjunctival swabs were obtained 7-9 days after inoculation. Non=
e of
  these cats showed significant pyrexia and all developed moderate submandi=
bular
  lymph node swellings; one became mildly depressed. The results indicate t=
he
  need for careful vaccine reconstitution and administration.

AB: 156 primiparous, breast-feeding women (25-35 years old), who were born =
and
  had grown up in West Germany were studied in Lower Saxony, Germany, betwe=
en the
  summer of 1992 and the summer of 1993. They were enrolled into a cross
  -sectional study by a network of 51 paediatric practices when bringing th=
eir
  infants for a U3 screening examination (4-6 weeks after delivery). Lifest=
yle
  and exposure factors were obtained by questionnaire. All human milk sampl=
es
  were analysed for HCH, hexachlorbenzene, DDT, dieldrin, polychlorinated
  biphenyls (PCB) and heptachlor; 50% of the samples were also analysed for
  dioxin. Compared with the Lower Saxony human milk surveillance programme,
  participants in this study had their milk analysed sooner after delivery =
and
  were more likely to have grown up in rural areas, less likely to have bee=
n
  exposed to hazardous substances, less likely to have a diet of health foo=
d and
  slightly less likely to be a smoker at the time of the study. Human milk
  contamination was comparable in both studies, and in all but 2 cases was =
well
  below the acceptable concentrations established by the Deutsche
  Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Fellowship). Human milk contamina=
tion
  was positively correlated with maternal age (PCB; P =3D 0.006), average d=
ietary
  fat intake per week (dioxin; P =3D 0.01) and proximity of residence to ha=
zardous
  sites (dioxin; P<0.05). There were negative correlations between residue
  concentrations and relative body weight at the time of the study (PCB;
  P<0.0001) and difference in body weight (weight - weight before pregnancy=
; PCB;
  P =3D 0.0002), respectively. Sentinel practice networks are a feasible an=

AB: Pyrethroid-impregnated bednets are being used nationwide in The Gambia.=
 The
  future success of this malaria control programme depends partly on the ve=
ctors
  remaining susceptible to the insecticides used for treating the nets. The
  present study was carried out on the south bank of the river Gambia, duri=
ng the
  first large scale trial of nets in this country. Thus this area represent=
s a
  sentinel site for detecting insecticide resistance in local vectors. This=
 study
  gives an example of how a system of early detection for resistance proble=
ms can
  be set up in a relatively complex situation where multiple vectors and no=
n
  -vectors are present. Samples of the Anopheles gambiae complex were caugh=
t
  indoors using light traps in 12 villages used in the bednet study. In all
  villages A. gambiae s.s. was the predominant member of the complex as
  determined using the rDNA-PCR diagnostic assay (other species included A.
  arabiensis and A. melas). Limited bioassays with DDT and permethrin, and
  biochemical assays for a range of insecticide resistance mechanisms sugge=
st
  that the A. gambiae complex remains completely susceptible to all major c=
lasses
  of commonly used insecticides including pyrethroids. Biochemical assays s=
uggest
  that a low frequency of DDT resistance may occur in A. melas. This is bas=
ed on
  elevated glutathione S-transferase levels coupled with increased levels o=
f DDT
  metabolism and does not involve cross-resistance to pyrethroids. Therefor=
e a
  decline in the efficacy of treated nets against malaria vectors in the st=
udy
  area in the immediate future is not envisaged, although monitoring should=
 be
  continued whilst wide-scale use of impregnated bednets is operational.

  indicators to evaluate the impact of disease control at the community or =
health
  facility level. The KMP is a longitudinal community-based study in rural
  southern Tanzania which investigates risk factors for malarial morbidity =
and
  developing household-based malaria control strategies. Biweekly morbidity=
 and
  bimonthly serological, parasitological and drug consumption surveys are c=
arried
  out in all study households. Mosquito (Anopheles gambiae s.l. and A. fune=
stus)
  densities are measured biweekly in 50 sentinel houses by timed light trap=
s.
  Determinants of transmission and indicators of exposure were not strongly
  aggregated within households. Subjective morbidity (recalled fever), obje=
ctive
  morbidity (elevated body temperature and high parasitaemia) and chloroqui=
ne
  consumption were strongly aggregated within a few households. Nested anal=
ysis
  of anti-NANP40 antibody suggests that only _30% of the titre variance can=
 be
  explained by household clustering and that the largest proportion of anti=
body
  titre variability must be explained by non-measured behavioural determina=

  on barley cv. Iona, oats cv. Sentinel, and Medicago sativa cv. Apica and =

  soil applications of Selcote Ultra and on a comparison of the effects of =
sodium
  selenate (laboratory and commercial grade). Soil at both locations was sa=
ndy
  loam in texture and the soil pH ranged from 5.8 to 6.0. Application of 5 =
g
  Se/ha as Selcote Ultra was adequate to raise the Se level in the first 2 =
cuts
  of forage tissue above the minimum required level of 100 =B5g/kg. For cer=
eals, 10
  g Se was necessary to achieve the same level. The residual effect of 10 g=
 Se
  from Selcote Ultra added in the first year maintained plant Se at >100 =
=B5g/kg in
  the second year in the first cut of M. sativa at one location and L.
  multiflorum at both locations. A comparison of selenate-Se (laboratory vs=
.
  commercial grade) showed that both sources at similar levels of Se applic=
ation
  were equally effective in enriching barley grain with Se with no signific=
ant
  differences. Addition of 10 g Se was necessary to ensure adequate Se (>10=
0
  =B5g/kg) concentration in the ensuing grain. Increasing rates of Se incre=
ased the
  Se levels in grain. Se concentrations were much higher in the barley boot=
 stage
  vegetative tissue than in the grain. It was concluded that only 5 g Se/ha=
, as
  Selcote Ultra, is needed to maintain adequate Se in forages. The laborato=
ry and
  commercially available selenate-Se sources were equally effective in rais=
ing Se
  in barley.

AB: The applicability of a circulating Schistosoma antigen detection assay =
for
  determining rates of infection and efficacy of chemotherapy was evaluated=
 in
  Mali. Urine egg counts were compared to circulating anodic antigen ELISA =
(CAA
  -ELISA) titres in serum, before and 6 weeks after treatment with a single=
 dose
  of praziquantel (40 mg/kg), in 2 villages in Dogon County, an area endemi=
c for
  S. haematobium. In Kassa, a village with a moderate prevalence of infecti=
on,
  the serological prevalence (48%) was significantly higher than the
  parasitological prevalence (31%). In Boro, a village with high parasitolo=
gical
  prevalence (76%), no difference was observed between the results of both
  methods (prevalence by CAA-ELISA was 75%). Cure rates estimated by CAA-EL=
ISA
  were lower than those determined parasitologically, suggesting that cure =
rates
  are overestimated by egg counting. The sensitivity of the CAA-ELISA was 7=
8%. In
  both villages, before treatment, a positive correlation was found between=
 the
  number of eggs in urine and serum CAA titres. It is concluded that, altho=
ugh
  further simplification and improvement of the sensitivity of the assay is
  needed, in its present ELISA format the antigen detection assay is useful=
 for
  monitoring sentinel populations. Furthermore, the serum CAA assay perform=
ed
  adequately in a public health laboratory within an endemic country.

AB: A competitive ELISA (C-ELISA) using a group specific monoclonal antibod=
y
  (MAb) against the bluetongue viruses (BTV) was established to detect anti=
bodies
  against BTV. Sera from sentinel cattle in West Java were tested. The resu=
lts of
  the C-ELISA were compared with the the agar gel immunodiffusion test. Inc=
reased
  specificity was observed using the MAb in the BTV C-ELISA. Not all sera t=
hat
  reacted in the AGID test reacted in the C-ELISA, and this was interpreted=
 as
  the elimination of cross-reactions to other orbiviruses, including epizoo=
tic
  haemorrhagic disease of deer viruses, that are a problem in rhe AGID test=
.
  Increased sensitivity with this test was also observed as seroconversions=
 to
  BTV were detected earlier by C-ELISA than with AGID. It was concluded tha=
t the
  C-ELISA not only has increased sensitivity and specificity, but also cost=
s less
  and can be used for sera from all species and should replace the AGID tes=
t for
  bluetongue serology.

AB: 33 two-month-old pigs, without clinical signs of pneumonia, were moved =
into
  an all-in-all-out (AIAO) facility at approximately 17-20 kg body wt. They
  remained in that facility until they reached 101-120 kg and were killed. =
33
  pigs were at the same time moved into a continuous-flow (CF) room. Nine o=
f
  these 33 pigs were from the same cohort as the AIAO pigs. The other 24 pi=
gs
  were older (3-5 months of age), and were from the same farm but came from=
 the
  CF finishing unit. These older CF pigs were presumed to be naturally infe=
cted
  with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and Pasteurella multocida. PM examination o=
f
  lungs at slaughter, bacterial isolations, serological tests, and fluoresc=
ent
  antibody tests indicated that the younger pigs in the CF room had been in=
fected
  with M. hyopneumoniae and P. multocida. Antimicrobials were not added to
  rations during this study. Pigs were examined weekly for coughing and cli=
nical
  signs. Six replicates of both AIAO and CF groups were completed during a =
2-year
  period. At slaughter, pig lungs were examined for lesions. Additionally, =
10
  lungs from pigs (designated as sentinel pigs) per treatment group were te=
sted
  by indirect-immunofluorescent assay for M. hyopneumoniae, and cultured fo=
r P.
  multocida. Lung lesions were less prevalent and severe in AIAO pigs (mean
  severity score 3%) than in CF pigs (mean severity score 15%). Five CF pig=
s
  died, while no AIAO pigs died. AIAO pigs were not coughing at any of the
  examinations, whereas CF pigs were coughing at all examinations. 43% of C=
F pigs
  displayed clinical signs of other diseases, compared with 7% of AIAO pigs=
. Of
  the sentinel pigs, one AIAO pig was positive for M. hyopneumoniae, wherea=
s 8 CF
  pigs were positive for M. hyopneumoniae and P. multocida.

AB: The suitability of serological surveys of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus=
) in
  determining the spread of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) was tested=
 in a
  south German area with a low risk of TBEV infection to man. Serum samples=
 from
  192 hunted roe deer were screened by haemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) a=
nd
  ELISA. Positive samples were tested in a neutralization test (NT). 50 (26=
%)
  serum samples were positive by ELISA and 43 (86%) of these were confirmed=
 by
  HAI or NT. 47 (24.5%) samples were positive by HAI, 44 (93.6%) of which w=
ere
  also positive in NT or ELISA. An insignificant increase of antibody preva=
lence
  with age (P =3D 0.17 for HAI antibodies) suggests that most infections oc=
cur at
  an early age in scattered natural foci. The antibody prevalence in female=
s was
  lower than in males (OR =3D 0.63; P =3D 0.02 for HAI antibodies). For exa=
mining the
  distribution of seropositive roe deer the sample size was increased to 23=
5
  sera. No antibodies were detected in 56 (23.8%) serum samples collected i=
n the
  eastern third of the country. The areas of high antibody prevalence in ro=
e deer
  match those in which man has been infected. It was concluded that serosur=
veys
  of roe deer are useful in marking out areas in which man faces the risk o=
f
  infection, provided that an adequate number of serum samples, preferably =
from
  males, is available.

AB: An immunohistochemical assay for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PC=
NA)
  which identifies cells in all active phases of the cell cycle was used. T=
his
  method which was mainly used for mammalian tissues, was adapted to 3 smal=
l fish
  species, medaka (Oryzias latipes), guppy (Poecilia reticulata), and weste=
rn
  mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), that are used in carcinogenesis bioassay=
s and
  environmental sentinel studies. PCNA was identified in routinely processe=
d,
  paraffin embedded specimens of these fishes. Optimum staining conditions =
were
  dependant on fixative, primary antibody, antigen retrieval processing and
  protein blocking reagent. The best results were achieved using 10% neutra=
l
  buffered formalin as fixative, clone PC10 as the primary antibody and a
  combination of powdered milk and bovine serum albumin as a protein block.=
 With
  the exception of medaka specimens, antigen retrieval was not required for
  specimens preserved in 10% neutral buffered formalin, but was required fo=
r the
  other fixatives tested. In whole fish specimens, PCNA marked cells in nor=
mally
  proliferating tissues such as testis, ovary, primary filament epithelium =
of the
  gill, haematopoietic tissues, thymus, retina and alimentary tract. It was
  concluded that this study demonstrated the successful application of mamm=
alian
  -based PCNA technology to these aquatic species and that further applicat=
ions
  of the assay will aid in understanding the role of cell proliferation in
  normal, diseased and toxicant-affected tissues of fish.

AB: To study the epidemiology of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infectio=
ns
  during the year (August 1990 to September 1991), the incidences of primar=
y
  infections and reinfections were monitored by titrating antibodies to bov=
ine
  RSV (BRSV) in 884 cattle in 6 dairy herds in the Netherlands at one-month
  intervals. A total of 155 cattle, mostly under 2 years of age, had a prim=
ary
  antibody response. Antibody increases were found in 259 cattle of all age=
s. The
  highest incidences of BRSV infections were found in 1 period either in au=
tumn
  or winter. In other seasons, primary infections were rare, whereas reinfe=
ctions
  were not uncommon. In 5 out of 6 herds, 2 seronegative sentinel calves we=
re
  introduced at the end of the winter and none developed specific antibodie=
s
  before the next winter. It is concluded that, in spite of regular reinfec=
tions,
  BRSV circulated during spring and summer at a very low level or not at al=
l. It
  was concluded that persistent BRSV infection in a number of cows might be=
 a
  means for the virus to survive during the summer, but reactivation of BRS=
V cold
  not be confirmed in experiments. A reservoir of infectious virus might be
  maintained by steady rate of infection of seropositive cows throughout th=
e year
  at a low level.

for
  plasma progesterone analysis and monthly rectal examinations were carried=
 out
  to monitor ovarian and uterine states. Body condition was scored every mo=
nth.
  There was a high monthly rate of acyclicity (51.1-67.4%). Animals in anoe=
strus
  had very poor body condition scores of 1.88=B10.04 compared with scores o=
f cyclic
  and pregnant animals (2.17=B10.13 and 2.75=B10.06 respectively). Despite =
the
  overall poor body condition, animals became pregnant at a mean body score=
 of
  2.6=B10.2 (n =3D 13). Calving occurred throughout the year with a tendenc=
y to peak
  in Oct. during 1989, but this was not repeated the following year. The me=
an
  calving percentage was 43.3%. The high rate of poor body condition and ov=
arian
  inactivity are attributed to undernutrition and phosphorus deficiency.

more
  elevated northwestern portion of the valley. Mean annual C. tarsalis abun=
dance
  was correlated inversely with elevation and distance from the Salton Sea.
  Abundance was greatest at managed marsh habitats. Although spatially corr=
elated
  with vector abundance among sites, virus transmission rates to sentinel
  chickens were asynchronous temporally with vector abundance. Seroconversi=
on
  rates were related to flock location but not flock size (10 vs. 20 chicke=

  virus transmission occurred and was not correlated with temperature, humi=
dity,
  or rainfall. Parity rates were highest during late summer when virus acti=

  peaked and were lowest during December when females may enter a short-ter=
m
  reproductive diapause. Although most likely underestimated, the proportio=
n of
  older multiparous females were collected at a consistent, but low level
  throughout the year. Changes in the parity rate seemed to be influenced
  primarily by the proportions of 1-parous females. Survivorship estimated =
from
  the parity rate (adjusted to account for autogeny) was highest in winter;
  however, the proportion of females surviving to potentially transmit eith=
er WEE
  or SLE virus was highest in summer and early autumn. Wing length decrease=
d in
  summer as an inverse correlate of temperature and increased as a function=
 of
  female age, implying that larger females lived longest. However, autogeno=
us
  females were larger than anautogenous females at emergence and only parou=
s
  autogenous females wee collected host seeking, thereby confounding the
  relationship between size and age. The proportion of females testing posi=
tive
  for fructose was greatest during winter and lowest during summer, perhaps
  affecting survivorship and blood-feeding avidity. The vector competence
  (infection, dissemination and transmission rates, and ID50) of females
  collected host seeking or emerging from field-collected pupae for WEE or =
SLE
  viruses remained similar over time, even though the wing length of female=
s used
  in these experiments differed among samples. It was concluded that in nat=
ure
  virus transmission progressed efficiently during midsummer because elevat=
ed
  temperatures shortened the extrinsic incubation period without markedly
  decreasing survivorship resulting in an increased proportion of females
  surviving extrinsic incubation to become infective.

  both the survival of multivoltine mosquitoes, and the size of the infecti=

  reservoir in natural populations of malaria vectors. During long-term
  surveillance of a population of A. gambiae s.l. in a Tanzanian village
  (Namawala, Kilombero District) by daily light trapping, a temporary dry s=
pell
  resulted in the cessation of recruitment for a period of 33 days, and a d=
ecline
  in numbers of A. arabiensis caught from >2000 to <10 in a sentinel house.=
 Traps
  placed elsewhere in the village indicated similar proportionate declines,
  although numbers caught varied according to location. A survival rate of =
83%
  per day was estimated from the rate of population decline. Survival was
  unrelated to the size of the mosquitoes. The infectious reservoir (the ch=
ance
  of a mosquito acquiring a Plasmodium falciparum infection) was estimated =
to be
  2% per feed. The exploitation of fortuitous events which temporarily elim=
inate
  a single stage in the life cycle has general applicability in the study o=

 The

  were obtained. Litter was seeded directly from infected chicks with
  unsporulated oocysts of Eimeria acervulina. Whilst sporulation proceeded
  rapidly, oocysts simultaneously began to deteriorate after only 24 h. Aft=
er 5
  days, most oocysts were disintegrating. Viable oocysts were, however, det=
ected
  (using sentinel birds) up to day 23, although subsequently the viability =
of the
  oocyst population began to wane. Few viable oocysts were detectable after=
 38
  days, despite some intact sporulated oocysts being evident up to 54 days.=
 The
  physical condition of oocysts is therefore not a reliable indication of t=
heir
  viability. The surface temperature of the litter was 25-28=B0C throughout=
 ant the
  moisture content varied from 31.0 to 62.1%; these conditions were not lim=

 was:
  12.5 and 10.86% in control as against 87.5 and 68.58% in T. brassicae plo=
ts in
  the respective years. O. nubilalis damage was calculated on crop ear samp=
les.
  The rate (%) of sentinel egg mass predation by wild predators showed no
  significant difference between control and release plots for both years. =
The
  low level of O. nubilalis damage to crop ears evinced the good search cap=
acity,
  parasitization and control effectiveness of T. brassicae.

AB: Between 1990 and 1992, 47 sentinel herds of 10-20 cattle each were
  established throughout Queensland, Australia to monitor bluetongue virus
  infection. 16 herds at 12 locations seroconverted to bluetongue viruses d=
uring
  the study. Herd incidence rates ranged from 0.0 to 3.45 seroconversions p=
er
  cattle-year at risk. The mean incidence rate was 0.29 seroconversions per
  cattle-year at risk (95% confidence interval 0.23-0.36), and the median
  incidence rate was 0.32 seroconversions per cattle-year at risk (95% CI 0=
.0
  -0.54). Only seroconversions to bluetongue virus serotypes 1 and/or 21 we=
re
  detected in the study; no evidence was found of infection with other sero=
types
  previously isolated in Australia (3, 9, 15, 16, 20, 23). Seroconversion t=
o
  serotype 1 occurred more frequently than seroconversion to serotype 21.
  Seroconversion generally occurred between April and July, being most comm=
on in
  May, but varied considerably within each of the 3 years of the study. Thi=
s
  study confirmed the presence of only serotypes 1 and 21 in Queensland and
  demonstrated the sporadic and restricted nature of bluetongue virus infec=
tion
  in the Queensland cattle herd.

ainst
  Getah virus (GETV) ranged from 15.5 to 26.3% in sera collected from pigs =
in
  South Korea in 1988-1993. The infection was more prevalent in southern re=

  of the peninsula. When a survey was conducted by age groups from August t=
o
  October in 1993, serum neutralizing antibodies against GETV were detected=
 in
  9.2 to 32.6% of sera from feeder pigs and in 21.1 to 72.9% of sera from s=
ows.
  Among 20 GETV sero-negative sentinel sows, seroconversion was first detec=
ted in
  July and continued to September. It is suggested that the infection might=
 be
  closely related to the appearance of mosquitos during that season.

PY: 1995
LA: English
AB: 464 cattle in 44 sentinel herds were studied between January 1990 and
  December 1992 using survival analysis. The association between risk of
  seroconversion to bluetongue viruses and 3 climatic variables: mean daily
  maximum temperature, mean daily minimum temperature, and mean daily rainf=
all,
  was assessed. Using stepwise regression techniques, the statistical model
  included: maximum temperature 1 and 2 months previously, minimum temperat=
ure 2
  and 3 months previously, and rainfall 1 and 3 months previously. The mode=
l also
  included an interaction term between maximum and minimum temperature 2 mo=
nths
  previously. All variable coefficients in the model except for maximum
  temperature 2 months previously were significantly different from zero. T=
he
  model predicted that nearly 100% of cases of seroconversion to bluetongue
  viruses at a typical location in south-east Queensland could be attribute=
d to
  climatic events occurring in autumn and early winter. It is suggested tha=
t
  there is a causal association between infection of cattle with bluetongue
  viruses and temperature and rainfall and that the lag period identified i=
s
  related to the effect of temperature and rainfall on Culicoides populatio=

AB: Lagenidium giganteum, a facultative parasite of mosquito larvae, has
  recently been registered by the US Environmental Protection Agency for
  operational mosquito control. The 1st pilot scale production of the mycel=
ium
  formulation is reported. Scale-up from 10 to 650 litres was accomplished =
by a
  proportionate increase of medium components and volume of water. Foaming =
of the
  culture medium had not been encountered previously, but was a serious pro=
blem
  in pilot scale production due to the very rapid growth of a large volume =
of L.
  giganteum. Addition of an antifoaming agent did not adversely affect grow=
th,
  but reduced the ability of the fungus to sporulate. Despite what was
  effectively a 100-fold reduction in the desired application rate due to r=
educed
  sporulation, L. giganteum infected sentinel mosquito larvae (Culex pipien=
s) and
  reduced field populations (of C. tarsalis and Anopheles freeborni) in
  California, USA, for >2 months following application.

AB: Pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) and chickens were compared as sentinels=

  monitoring the transmission of arboviruses of public health significance =
in
  Florida, USA, during 1991-93. Results suggest that pheasants are better
  sentinels for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus. They detected viru=
s
  transmission 3-6 weeks earlier in epizootic years, 2-4 times more frequen=
tly
  during the season, and twice as many birds within a flock seroconverted d=
uring
  a given week. Pheasants detected virus transmission at 2 sites during 2
  interepizootic years when chickens failed. Although pheasants detected St=
.
  Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus activity somewhat later than did chickens,=
 they
  had greater seroconversion rates than did chickens. Although both bird sp=
ecies
  can be used to monitor EEE and SLE viruses, pheasants are more sensitive =
than
  chickens as sentinels for EEE virus and as sensitive as chickens as senti=
nels
  for SLE virus.

AB: Adult hens, similar to those used for arbovirus surveillance, were
  experimentally infected with western equine encephalitis (WEE) and St. Lo=
uis
  encephalitis (SLE) viruses to describe the viraemia response, to compare
  serological testing methods, and to evaluate a new method of collecting w=
hole
  blood onto filter paper strips from lancet pricks of chicken comb. Young =
(19
  weeks), but not old (38 weeks), hens developed a low-titre, transient vir=
aemia
  for a 1-day period. IgG was detected by days 10 and 14 after infection wi=
th WEE
  and SLE viruses, respectively, by indirect fluorescent antibody tests,
  haemagglutination inhibition tests and plaque reduction neutralization te=
sts on
  sera and in direct enzyme immunoassays (EIA) on both sera and eluates fro=

IgG,
  respectively, but IgM could not be detected reliably in eluates from drie=
d
  blood. Sera and dried blood samples collected from naturally infected sen=
tinel
  chickens gave comparable results when tested by an EIA for IgG.

AB: Dispersal of C. bezziana was studied in Papua New Guinea by releasing r=
adio
  -isotope labelled, laboratory-reared flies and collecting their labelled =
egg
  masses from sentinel cattle. A log-linear model was developed to describe
  recapture rate. Distance was found to dominate the model and was represen=
ted by
  a bilinear ('broken-stick') term as log-distance. Further terms in the mo=
del
  such as attractiveness of the site (estimated from the number of non-labe=
lled
  egg masses), the season of the year and a time trend were statistically
  significant but of minor importance. From the model, the median distance
  females dispersed before depositing an egg mass was 10.8 km. The maximum
  distance from the release site that egg masses were recovered was 100 km.=
 The
  dispersal ability of C. bezziana is discussed in terms of its impact on t=
he
  prospects of eradicating this species using the sterile insect release me=
thod
  (SIRM) if an outbreak occurred in Australia.

AB: Two mosquito-borne flaviviruses, Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) and K=
unjin
  (KUN), are the aetiological agents of Australian encephalitis. MVE causes=
 a
  severe and potentially fatal form of the disease, while KUN is responsibl=
e for
  only a few relatively mild cases. Therefore, it is important that serolog=
ical
  tests used in flavivirus surveillance differentiate between infections wi=
th
  these 2 viruses. However, this has been hampered in the past by the close
  antigenic relationships between flaviviruses in traditional serological a=
ssays.
  An epitope blocking ELISA using MVE-specific and KUN-specific monoclonal
  antibodies (mAb) reacting to the non-structural protein NS1 of these viru=
ses
  and a flavivirus group-specific mAb reacting to the envelope (E) protein =
was
  assessed for testing sentinel animals for seroconversion to specific flav=
ivirus
  infections. Using these assays, the authors were able to detect serum
  antibodies to a variety of flaviviruses in laboratory infected rabbits an=
d
  naturally infected chickens, and in the case of primary infections,
  differentiate those caused by KUN or MVE. These assays are now used routi=
nely
  in the laboratory for testing chicken sera from sentinel flocks in the
  Kimberley and Pilbara regions of north Western Australia.

1%).
  During the course of the experiment, 10 sentinel calves died from sub-acu=

  fasciolosis. Previous and concurrent snail population studies showed that
  Lymnaea natalensis, the snail intermediate host for F. gigantica, begins
  emerging in early March and reaches maturity by late April. On both occas=

AB: In a 285-sow herd where an outbreak of the porcine reproduction and

 (IIF)
  and virus isolation in 1991-91, the possible persistence of infection in =
the
  absence of clinical signs was investigated by introducing sentinel SPF pi=
glets
  to the herd 4 months after the outbreak. Clinical signs were evident in a=
ll of
  the sentinels and prolonged fever (_40=B0C) was recorded one day after ex=
posure.
  Antibody titres to PRRS virus could be detected by IIF after 7 days, and
  reached 1:1024 by day 21. 3 of the sentinels developed significant virus
  neutralizing antibody titres (>1:8 to _1:128) by day 35. In all cases the=
 virus
  could be isolated from the serum between days 7 and 42. Lesions of inters=
titial
  pneumonia were demonstrated in a few animals. In experimental inoculation
  studies, the viral strain isolated from the sentinel pigs produced severe
  reproductive disorders in 2 sows inoculated at 95 days of gestation. This=
 study
  confirms that subclinical PRRS virus infection persists for a significant
  period in different age groups and locations and may be transmitted to
  replacement animals or via stock sold to healthy farms.

AB: Releases of M. zaraptor and P. vindemmiae were made at 4 beef cattle fe=
eding
  lots in eastern Nebraska, USA. The ability of the parasites to parasitize=
 house
  fly (Musca domestica) and stable fly (Stomoxys calcitrans) pupae under am=
bient
  environmental conditions was measured. The 2 species were released 7 time=
s at 2
  -week intervals from a central location within each of the 4 feedlots. Bo=
th
  species were recovered significantly more often from sentinel pupae place=
d
  around the perimeter of each feedlot than from sentinel pupae at untreate=
d
  feedlots. Mean mortality of sentinel pupae for the 4 release feedlots ran=
ged
  from 28 to 42% compared with 4.8% for 2 untreated feedlots. Parasites rec=
overed
  from sentinel pupae comprised 87% Muscidifurax zaraptor and 12% P. vindem=
miae.
  Correlations between the percentage mortality of sentinel pupae and the n=
umber
  of parasites released were poor. However, when the interaction of weekly =
mean
  air temperature was considered, a significant correlation between reducti=
on of
  sentinel pupae and the number of parasites released was evident. Differen=
ces in
  parasitism between release and control sites were not as apparent when pa=
rasite
  emergence from naturally occurring house fly and stable fly puparia was
  determined. The indigenous M. zaraptor was clearly superior to the introd=
uced
  P. vindemmiae and readily parasitized house fly pupae around the perimete=
r of
  the release feedlots. The results also suggested that periods of mean wee=
kly
  temperature exceeding 27=B0C appeared to adversely affect both parasite s=
pecies.

AB: Melarsomine dihydrochloride (RM 340), a drug being developed as an
  adulticide for treatment of Dirofilaria immitis infection in dogs, was sa=
fe and
  highly effective as a clinical prophylactic agent against naturally acqui=
red
  infections using Strategic and Tactical Treatment Programs. The Strategic
  Program involved treatment every 4 months (3 series of treatments per yea=
r),
  disregarding the mosquito season (MS), to clear the existing infection at=
 each
  treatment. The Tactical Program consisted of 2 series of treatments per y=
ear, 4
  months apart, with the first one given about the middle of the MS (August=
) and
  the second one given after the end of the MS (December). Melarsomine was
  administered as 2 im injections (lumbar muscles) of 2.2 mg/kg given 3 h a=
part.
  A total of 90 heartworm-naive beagles and a number of microfilaraemic 'se=
ed'
  dogs were used. Three similar experiments (30 beagles per experiment) wer=
e
  conducted at selected areas (Georgia, Florida, Louisiana) known to be enz=
ootic
  for heartworm. At each site, 30 beagles were allocated to 6 groups of 5 d=
ogs
  each, and 4 of these groups were placed outdoors in April of 1988. Two gr=
oups
  (control and treated) were exposed for 12 months, and the treated group w=
as
  given melarsomine at 4, 8, and 12 months after exposure was started (Stra=
tegic
  Program). Another group was exposed for 8 months and treated with melarso=
mine
  at 4 and 8 months (Tactical Program). One group of tracer (sentinel) beag=
les
  was exposed from April to August 1988, one group from August to December =
1988,
  and another from December 1988 to April 1989. April-August and August-Dec=
ember
  tracers served as controls for the tactically treated dogs. After exposur=
e, all
  dogs were held indoors for 5 months before necropsy. Blood was collected =
at 4-5
  month intervals and examined for microfilariae (MF) and adult heartworm a=
ntigen
  (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ELISA). Treatment by the Strategic Pr=
ogram
  was 99% effective, with only one of the total of 15 treated dogs harbouri=
ng any
  worms (a single female) at necropsy. 13 of the 14 control dogs (93%) expo=
sed
  for 12 months became infected, with average worm recoveries of 6.8, 5.4, =
and
  25.2 (range 1-45) for the Georgia, Florida, and Louisiana sites, respecti=
vely.
  All of the 13 heartworm-infected control dogs were antigen-positive, and =
12 of
  these were also MF-positive, while none of the strategically treated dogs=
 was
  either antigen- or ll820hh MF-positive at necropsy. Tactical treatment of=
 the
  total of 14 dogs twice per year was 100% effective. 86% (combined average=
) of
  the April-August tracers and 73% of the August-December tracers had heart=
worms.
  None of the 14 tactically treated dogs was positive for antigen or MF at
  necropsy, while 17 of the 29 controls were antigen-positive, and 4 of the=
se
  were also MF-positive.

AB: The classical method of estimating the density of Plasmodium falciparum=

with a
  method in which the proportion of microscope fields in a thick film that
  include at least one asexual form is evaluated. Mean densities of 144 and=
 1920
  trophozoites/=B5l blood gave 9.5% and 99.5% positive fields, respectively=
, and
  <5% of slides with 100% positive fields were of blood with <2000
  trophozoites/=B5l. The proportion with high parasitaemia (PHP) in a popul=
ation,
  defined as the proportion of individuals with 100% positive fields, is pr=
oposed
  as a simple and reliable indicator of relative changes in malaria morbidi=
ty due
  to seasonal fluctuations or control activities. However, the use of this =
index
  is limited to areas with intermediate malaria stability. Data from a
  longitudinal survey in Burundi, presented to illustrate the use of PHP, s=
how
  that PHP undergoes important fluctuations related to transmission. In con=
trast
  to the parasite index, the amplitude of fluctuations in PHP decreases wit=
h age
  as a result of acquired protective immunity. Although 2 health centres, o=
ne in
  a vector control area and one in an area with no control, reported simila=
r
  proportions of cases of clinical malaria among their patients, PHP was ab=
out 3
  times lower in patients from the vector control areas. The estimation of =
the
  efficacy of a malaria control programme from simple clinical information
  appears unreliable. Sentinel health centres, each equipped with a microsc=
ope to
  estimate PHP, may often be better indicators of changes in morbidity.

AB: In vivo testing of Plasmodium falciparum sensitivity to chloroquine was
  carried out in 4 rural sites of differing socio-geographical environment =
in
  Cote d'Ivoire. Of a total of 1282 patients of all ages with fever or prev=
ious
  history of fever, 649 were slide positive, with 435 patients with a pure =
P.
  falciparum infection; 191 fulfilled all the criteria for inclusion in thi=
s
  study, and 113 completed it. Treatment failure rates ranged from 9.7%
  (Djebonoua) to 38.1% (Tieviessou), and were most often associated with hi=
gher
  degrees of resistance (RII =3D 54.2%; RIII =3D 37.5%). Blood chloroquine =
levels
  measured by ELISA test suggest that many people take chloroquine routinel=
y;
  furthermore 37.5% of resistance cases occurred in subjects who had high b=
lood
  chloroquine concentrations on day 0. Twenty-three out of 24 cases of resi=
stance
  were found in children under 7 years of age. Nearly all children with
  persisting parasitaemia were afebrile on day 7, even those (7/8) with RII=
I
  resistance. Children aged <7 years represent the best sentinel group for
  monitoring P. falciparum sensitivity to chloroquine in Cote d'Ivoire.

e the
  oral toxicity and carcinogenicity potential of olestra, a fat substitute
  consisting of a mixture of the hexa-, hepta- and octaesters of sucrose fo=
rmed
  with long-chain fatty acids. In a dose-response study, olestra was fed at=
 0,
  2.5, 5 or 10% (w/w) of the diet. In a companion study conducted to confir=
m
  equivocal effects, olestra was fed at 0 or 10% (w/w) of the diet. Olestra
  -containing diets were supplemented with fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and=
 K to
  maintain the nutritional status of the olestra-fed mice at a level simila=
r to
  that of the control mice. 100 mice/sex were placed in each group. 50
  mice/sex/group were predesignated to the carcinogenicity portion of the s=
tudy
  and all survivors were killed at 24 months. 15 mice/sex/group were
  predesignated to the toxicity portion of the study and were killed at 12
  months. 35 mice/sex/group were included as sentinel animals to be used fo=
r
  monitoring nutritional status. Ophthalmoscopic examinations were conducte=
d
  before the test and at 12 and 24 months. Body weights and food consumptio=
n were
  estimated weekly. Gross observations, clinical chemistry and haematology =
data
  were obtained on mice killed at 12 and 24 months. Complete gross postmort=
em
  examinations, including organ weight and organ-to-body and organ-to-brain
  weight ratios were performed on all mice. Histopathology was conducted on=
 a
  full complement of tissues from all mice allocated to the carcinogenicity
  portions of the studies. There were no olestra-related effects on any of =
the
  endpoints measured, including survival, time-to-tumour or tumour incidenc=
e,
  ophthalmology, clinical chemistry, haematology, organ weights or tissue
  morphology. The results indicate that olestra is not toxic or carcinogeni=

d in
  the Nqutu district of KwaZulu, South Africa, by means of a representative
  community-based sample and concurrent samples from primary health care cl=
inics,
  preschools and primary schools. The extent of acute nutritional stress in=
 the
  district was evaluated as an indication of the appropriateness of food re=
lief
  efforts in the region. The absence of wasting and the high prevalence of
  stunting (37.5%) suggested that the main problem was chronic socioeconomi=
c
  underdevelopment, rather than a severe or immediate lack of food. The fac=
t that
  <20% of households were in any way reliant on domestic production for the=
ir
  maize requirements explains why a drought that occurred did not have a gr=
eater
  impact on the nutritional state of this vulnerable group. The usefulness =
of
  clinics, preschools and schools as sites for the collection of anthropome=
tric
  data and the development of nutritional programmes was also evaluated.

AB: Captive-reared mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were used as sentinels to =
study
  the epizootiology of avian botulism at the Sacramento National Wildlife R=
efuge,
  Willows, California, (USA) from 1986 to 1989. Sentinel mallards were wing
  -clipped, and 40 to 50 birds were confined in 1.6-ha enclosures in 11 sel=
ected
  wetlands (pools). Enclosures were searched intensively 3 to 4 times weekl=
y from
  July through October. Sick and dead wild sentinel birds were collected, k=
illed,
  and tested for type C botulism toxin. Botulism epizootics occurred in sen=
tinel
  mallards in 1986, and 1989, but only a few isolated cases of botulism wer=
e
  detected in 1988. In most epizootics, botulism also was detected simultan=
eously
  in wild birds using the same pool outside the enclosure. Outbreaks in sen=
tinels
  were started and perpetuated in the absence of vertebrate carcasses. A se=
x
  -specific trend in the probability of intoxication was detected, with mal=
es
  contracting botulism at a higher rate than females. Daily mortality rates=
 of
  sentinels during botulism epizootics ranged from 0.0006 to 0.0600, with a=
 mean
  of 0.0190. These rates would result in the daily loss of 0.6 to 60 birds =
per
  1000 at risk. The use of sentinel birds provided an effective means of
  gathering site-specific epidemiological data.

  populations of Eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) virus. The Maryland
  strain was isolated from Culiseta melanura and a sentinel bobwhite quail =
on the
  Delmerva peninsula. New York isolates were from songbirds and C. melanura
  collected near Syracuse. RNA fingerprinting revealed that most population=
s
  within infected hosts (unpassaged isolates) contained a consensus genotyp=
e
  along with minority genotypes differing in 1-3 T1)>-resistant oligonucleo=
tides.
  Mutation frequencies were similar to those reported for other RNA viruses=
,
  suggesting that the slow rate of EEE virus evolution is not limited by fi=
delity
  of genome replication. Within a given year, genetic diversity was general=
ly
  greater among geographically distant isolates than among those from the s=
ame
  transmission focus, suggesting that dispersal among EEE viruses in North
  America is not complete annually. Two of 3 bird isolates from Maryland an=
d New
  York contained relatively distantly related genotypes, differing in 15-19
  oligonucleotides. A 1985 mosquito isolate from Maryland contained stable,=
 small
  plaque variants which comprised the majority of that population. These sm=
all
  plaque variants differed by up to 8 T1-resistant oligonucleotides when co=
mpared
  with their large plaque counterparts. Temperature sensitive virus was not
  detected in 6 unpassaged mosquito isolates from Maryland and New York.

  follow-up period and equal to 1.9%. Five patient characteristics were fou=
nd to
  be independent and important predictors of treatment failure in a Cox
  proportional hazards model: a young age (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] for =
an
  increase of 10 years of age =3D 0.75 [95% CI =3D 0.62,0.91]); a history o=
f a least
  3 documented mefloquine treatments in the past year (AHR =3D 1.89 [95% CI=
 =3D
  1.10,3.24]); a parasitaemia count > 100 000/=B5l (AHR =3D 1.80 [95% CI =
=3D
  1.16,2.80]); and a history of diarrhoea in the first 2 days after treatme=
nt
  (AHR =3D 1.51 [95% CI =3D 0.99,2.31]). A haemoglobin level _ 10 g/dl on t=
he day of
  consultation was also a predictor of treatment failure, but only among pa=
tients
  who had been treated for malaria in the past 120 days (AHR =3D 4.38 [95% =
CI =3D
  1.55,12.1]). These latter patients may have become anaemic while they wer=
e
  unsuccessfully treated with mefloquine for an infection by a multiple dru=
g
  -resistant strain in the past 120 days. It appears that the anaemic patie=
nts
  may have been included in the study at the time of recrudescence from thi=
s
  original infection, and they were at higher risk of treatment failure sin=
ce the
  strain infecting them was mefloquine-resistant. Children living in malari=

  areas, being at higher risk of treatment failure, may represent a suitabl=
e
  sentinel population for the monitoring of in vivo drug resistance.

AB: Field studies in maize and pepper [Capsicum annuum] were carried out ne=
ar
  Bologna, northern Italy, to evaluate the foraging behaviour of Trichogram=
ma
  maidis, an egg parasitoid of the pyralid Ostrinia nubilalis. T. maidis (B=
ologna
  strain) was reared on eggs of the pyralid Ephestia kuehniella and release=
d at
  about the time of deposition of the 1st- and 2nd-generation egg masses of=
 O.
  nubilalis. Four releases in June and 4 in July were made in plots of both=
 crops
  at the rate of 6.4 adults/m2 over an area of 800 m2. Parasitization in th=
e
  plots was monitored using sentinel egg masses of O. nubilalis. A comparis=
on of
  total parasitization rates by T. maidis in maize and pepper showed that t=
here
  were no significant differences between the 2 crops in the 1st generation=
 of O.
  nubilalis (21.95% in maize versus 24.82% in pepper), but a significantly =
higher
  rate in pepper in the 2nd generation (10.71% versus 20.95%.). The absence=
 of
  parasitization in sentinel egg masses of O. nubilalis deployed in a contr=
ol
  plot 100 m from the release point showed that indigenous species of
  Trichogramma had no influence on the results. Given that the canopy of pe=
pper
  remains practically unchanged from spring to summer, it is suggested that=
 the
  most plausible explanation for the results is that the host-searching abi=
lity
  of T. maidis decreases as the leaf area index of maize increases. In both
  crops, there was an inverse relationship between distance from release po=
int
  and percentage parasitism of sentinel egg masses.

LA: English
AB: Sentinel Community Surveillance using epidemiological methods has sever=
al
  advantages for planners in fields other than health. By separating and
  analysing the components of risk, it provides the detail necessary to mak=
e
  informal judgements concerning potential impact, and provides the possibi=
lity
  of returning to the same individuals to measure whether planning decision=
s had
  intended results. This repeatability factor, together with the larger num=
ber of
  respondents it provides per unit of expenditure, makes it more cost-effec=
tive
  than most other survey methods. Because it is community-based, the method=
ology
  provides a voice for communities in planning judgements while also having
  sufficient scientific rigour that its conclusions can interact with exist=
ing
  formal measurement systems. It is particularly suited to decentralized pl=
anning
  structures and is capable of assisting district and local leadership in m=
aking
  more scientific decisions. The method is applied to drought and structura=
l
  adjustment in Zimbabwe and education in Monrovia, Liberia.

AB: Western equine encephalitis (WEE) virus activity was studied in Argenti=
na
  during 1983-86 by equine case notification and the use of sentinel animal=
s
  (horses, chickens and geese). Of the 13 foci of disease notified in Cordo=
ba and
  Santa Fe provinces, 5 of 16 presumed equine cases were shown to be positi=
ve by
  haemagglutination inhibition. 28 notified human cases were found to be
  negative. Anti-WEE virus antibody prevalence was lower in sentinel horses=
 in
  Cordoba province (4%) than Santa Fe province (13%). Antibodies disappeare=
d over
  a 12-month period in 40% of Santa Fe horses. 2 seroconversions were detec=
ted in
  Cordoba (December 1983-April 1986) and 9 in Santa Fe province (February 1=
984
  -July 1986). One of the horses from Cordoba also seroconverted with the
  enzootic WEE AG 80-646 virus. Due to recognized cross-reactivity between =
the 2
  virus strains, seroconversion was attributed to WEE epizootic virus. No v=
iral
  activity was detected in sentinel birds.

AB: An investigation of the extent of St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus
  activity in the avian population of Pine Bluff, Arkansas, USA, was conduc=
ted
  from 30 August 1991 to 5 September 1991, following a SLE epidemic that re=
sulted
  in 25 human cases. A total of 363 birds of 33 species were captured with =
ground
  -level mist nets at 4 sites along the northern edge of the city. No virus=
es
  were isolated from the serum of these birds, but 91 birds (25%) of 11 spe=
cies
  had detectable neutralizing antibody against the TBH-28 strain of SLE vir=
us in
  the constant-virus, serum-dilution, plaque-reduction neutralization test =
in
  Vero cell culture. No antibody to eastern equine encephalitis virus was
  detected. The prevalence of antibody to SLE virus varied among the sites =
from
  11 to 44%, but the prevalence at each site was influenced by the avian sp=
ecies
  composition. The 2 most abundant species captured in the city, the Americ=
an
  robin (Turdus migratorius) (43%) and house sparrow [Passer domesticus] (4=
2%),
  also had the highest prevalence of antibody. Nine other bird species were
  serologically positive but at significantly lower rates than for the abun=
dant
  species. The antibody prevalence was higher in immature birds (27%) than =
in
  adult birds (15%), but the antibody titres were higher in adult birds tha=
n in
  immature ones. The overall SLE antibody prevalence and the prevalence for=
 house
  sparrows were significantly higher than the average prevalence for avian =
hosts
  studied during previous SLE epidemics. Therefore, house sparrows would be=
 a
  good choice for a local sentinel species.

AB: A longitudinal epidemiological study of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL)
  transmission was conducted between July 1989 and June 1991 in a 1200-km2 =
sector
  of the northeastern Sinai Desert monitored by the Multinational Force and
  Observers (MFO), an international peace keeping mission between Egypt and
  Israel. The occurrence of human cases, sandfly density, rodent collection=
 and
  isolations of Leishmania confirmed only 1 of 4 surveyed locations as a
  significant focus of CL transmission. Phlebotomus papatasi, the only
  anthropophilic sandfly species encountered at this focus, comprised >96% =
of the
  sandfly population and attained human landing densities exceeding 100
  sandflies/person/h during 1990. Seasonal activity of this species ranged =
from
  April to November, with highest densities occurring during the period May
  -September. A peak promastigote infection rate of 2.4% (13 of 534) was ob=
served
  in P. papatasi during July 1990. 12 of the 60 (20%) persons at risk durin=
g the
  6 months of intense sandfly activity at this site developed lesions consi=
stent
  with CL; Leishmania major was isolated from 9 (75%) of these cases. L. ma=
jor
  infection was acquired by 2 of 22 (9%) sentinel hamsters used during the =
same
  period. >97% of the 897 wild rodents trapped at this site were desert ger=
bil
  species. L. major was the only Leishmania isolated from human, sandfly, w=
ild
  rodent (Gerbillus pyramidum), and sentinel hamster infections that origin=
ated
  at site Check point 1-Delta, the focus of CL transmission within jurisdic=
tion
  of the MFO. The altered ecology of this area, created by construction of =
a dam,
  may contribute significantly to the transmission dynamics of CL at this f=
ocus.

AB: To determine the effectiveness of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virgini=

  as sentinel animals in serological surveillance programmes for B. burgdor=
feri,
  ELISA and Western immunoblotting analyses were performed on 467 deer seru=
m
  samples. The seropositivity rate in the ELISA was 5% for the 150 samples
  collected at the 3 sites in which the tick Ixodes scapularis was absent. =
The 3
  sites with established I. scapularis populations had a seropositivity rat=
e of
  80% for 317 samples. Results were similar for 2 closely situated sites, o=
ne
  with an established I. scapularis population and one without; these sites=
 were
  only 15 km apart. Rates of seropositivity were significantly higher in ye=
arling
  and adult deer than in fawns. The mean numbers of bands seen on Western
  immunoblots were 3.0 for samples negative in the ELISA and 13.8 for sampl=
es
  positive in the ELISA; all of these samples were collected from sites in =
which
  I. scapularis was established. At sites in which I. scapularis was absent=
, the
  mean numbers of bands seen were 1.6 for samples negative in the ELISA and=
 8.2
  for samples positive in the ELISA. There were 14 different B. burgdorferi
  antigens that reacted with >50% of the ELISA-positive samples from areas =
with
  I. scapularis. A 19.5-kDa antigen reacted with 94% of the ELISA-positive
  samples. Reactivity against OspA and OspB was weak and infrequent (2%).
  Serological analysis of white-tailed deer sera appears to be an accurate =
and
  sensitive surveillance method for determining whether B. burgdorferi is p=

AB: This paper examines some theoretical and practical aspects of deliverin=
g
  human and animal health care to rural societies. Economic theory of the p=
rivate
  versus the public good argues against the integration of human and animal
  health interventions. Judging by the scarcity of documented examples of
  beneficial integration of human and veterinary health care interventions,
  economic theory may indeed bear out what is found in practice. Explanatio=
ns for
  this apparent lack of integration of human and animal health care systems=
 may
  stem from the Western oriented, anthropocentric way development specialis=
ts
  approach the problem. Examples are described where appropriate and financ=
ially
  viable animal health delivery systems are designed on sound veterinary
  epidemiology and ethnoveterinary principles. These examples may serve as =
a
  basis for designing integrated human and veterinary health care intervent=
ions.
  Available tools, such as geographic information systems, sentinel cases, =
ethno
  -veterinary research and pictogram/computer systems, which may be used to
  design more cost effective interventions, are discussed.

f
  arbovirus activity in these different zones, sentinel chicken flocks were=
 bled
  4 times a year and their antibody conversion rates determined by the
  haemagglutination-inhibition test. Although mosquito abundance at sites c=
lose
  to the reservoir were 1.5-6.1 times higher than at the more distant sites=
,
  arbovirus conversion rates, particularly to the alphaviruses Ross River a=
nd
  Sindbis, varied according to zone and year, suggesting that risk of infec=
tion
  was no greater around the dam than elsewhere. Other arboviruses thought t=
o have
  been present were Getah, Murray Valley encephalitis, Kunjin, Kokobera, Al=

  viruses were isolated from 236 feral ducks, 89 other wild birds, 735 dome=
stic
  ducks from a single farm, and from 193 Pekin ducks used as sentinels for
  populations of wild aquatic (mainly sea) birds. The efficiency of virus
  isolation was 9.9% overall - 8.7% in wild ducks, 0.9% in other wild birds=
, and
  38% in Pekin ducks. The use of sentinel ducks in wild pelagic bird coloni=
es
  improved virus detection rates 5-fold, suggesting an advantage in ecologi=
cal
  studies. Among the 40 different combinations of haemagglutinin and
  neuraminidase subtypes H6N1 (23.6%) was the most common for all species
  followed by H4N6 (11%). Among individual species the frequency profiles
  included H2N3 (20.8%) and H4N6 (20.3%) in wild ducks; H7N7 (22.3%), H4N6
  (24.4%) and H2N3 (10.4%) in sentinel Pekin ducks; and H6N1 (34.8%) and H6=
N6
  (15.1%) in domestic ducks on the single farm. Using sentinel birds for
  serological assays it was possible to trace an 'influenza season' in fera=
l swan
  populations, beginning in August and continuing through the winter months=
.
  Comparison of subtype distribution of influenzaviruses for Europe and Nor=
th
  America showed significant differences. This indicates 2 geographically
  distinct gene pools of influenzaviruses in birds.

AB: A regional prospective study of the epidemiology of bluetongue virus (B=
TV)
  serotypes covering 11 countries in Central America and the Caribbean took=
 place
  between 1987 and 1992. Active surveillance revealed BTV infection to be e=
ndemic
  in the absence of confirmed indigenous cases of bluetongue. During the st=
udy,
  >300 BTV isolations were obtained from cattle and sheep. Results of the e=
arlier
  years of the study were summarized, and surveillance activities from Nove=
mber
  1990 to February 1992 were evaluated. 45 BTV isolations were made during =
this
  time, 44 from sentinel cattle and 1 from a ram with clinical signs compat=
ible
  with contagious ecthyma. Virus isolation from potential vectors also was
  attempted, yielding a further 9 BTV isolates from parous Culicoides insig=
nis
  and C. pusillus, 2 from blood-engorged C. filarifer, and 1 epizootic
  haemorrhagic disease virus type-2 isolate from parous C. pusillus. BTV-1 =
was
  the predominant serotype in Central America in 1991, after an apparent ab=
sence
  of 1 year in the sentinel animals. Other serotypes in Central America at =
that
  time included BTV-3 and -6. In Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, BT=
V-4
  became the predominant serotype, without detection of BTV-8 and BTV-17, w=
hich
  were common in recent years of the study. The serotypes found in the Cari=
bbean
  Basin continued to have marked differences from those in North America. T=
he
  importance of viewing bluetongue as an infection, the distribution of whi=
ch is
  determined principally by ecological factors, is emphasized.

AB: Clinical bluetongue (BLU) disease has not yet been diagnosed in Indones=

  ruminants, although sheep imported from Australia have suffered severe
  mortalities with clinical signs and pathology consistent with BLU.
  Seroepidemiological studies have shown that BLU virus infections are wide=
spread
  throughout the islands of Indonesia, affecting buffaloes, cattle, sheep, =
and
  goats. Livestock at higher altitudes have a lower prevalence of infection=
s than
  those in low altitude areas. Hence, the absence of clinical diseases is i=
n
  spite of the presence of large populations of naive animals. Studies with
  sentinel groups of animals are showing that there is a seasonal pattern o=
f
  infections with BLU group viruses, with a pattern emerging of viral activ=
ity at
  the end of the wet season. Confirmed isolations of BLU viruses in Indones=
ia
  allow more precise seroepidemiological studies to be conducted, in which =
the
  geographical distribution and species susceptibility for the isolated ser=
otypes
  are determined.

AB: A serological study of BLU virus activity in southern Turkey was made
  between 1986 and 1989. Serum samples from more than 3000 cattle and sheep
  collected from 21 provinces, mainly in southern Turkey, were examined. An=
alysis
  of data for cattle suggests that BLU viruses have either been absent or h=
ave
  only occurred at very low levels since 1982. Although the prevalence of
  seropositive sheep declined with animals born from 1985 onwards, a signif=
icant
  proportion of these animals still seroconverted. Sentinel herds of cattle=
 and
  sheep confirmed the absence of bluetongue in these regions. Vector studie=
s
  carried out between September 1988 and 1989 recorded widespread prevalenc=
e of
  Culicoides imicola, a major virus vector, across southern Turkey. This ve=
ctor
  was active throughout the region in Spring, Summer and Autumn but was abs=
ent
  from all areas between December and February. It is concluded that BLU vi=
ruses
  are not endemic in southern Turkey, but that virus incursions do occur at
  intervals, possibly from areas to the southeast of the country. The prese=
nce of
  large numbers of young serologically naive animals, however, suggests tha=
t
  Turkey is now exceptionally vulnerable to future incursions of BLU viruse=

AB: Influence of attractant, season, habitat, temperature and physiological
  state of Cochliomyia hominivorax on daily activity and oviposition were
  examined during a 122-day study in a tropical dry forest in Costa Rica. F=
lies
  were marked and released. Numbers of flies visiting baits increased durin=
g the
  wet season and decreased during the dry season; 3 times more flies were
  observed at baits during the wet season than were observed during the dry
  season. An average of 33 females and 3 males was observed per day during =
the
  study. More flies (3.6 times) were attracted to rotting liver than to sen=
tinel
  sheep; many flies originally marked at liver failed to return and few of =
them
  oviposited on sentinel sheep. Females marked at sheep remained in the stu=
dy
  area longer. More females marked at sheep sites were recaptured (51.4-54.=
1%)
  than those marked at liver sites (32.3-44.7%). More than 6 times as many =
flies
  were observed at forest than at pasture sites. The physiological state of=
 the
  female influenced daily activity. High temperatures during midday (>31=B0=
C)
  depressed activity and decreased the number of foraging hours available f=
or
  flies during the dry season. Decreasing host resources and number of hour=
s
  available for foraging may be factors that limit screwworm populations in=
 the
  dry season.

  endemic areas in Italy are the Ligurian coast, the province of Friuli Ven=
ezia
  Giulia, and the region surrounding the town of Bologna. Serosurveys of th=
e
  general population and of sentinel animals were useless in determining th=
e
  diffusion of Lyme borreliosis, whereas evaluation of people at risk of ti=
ck
  bites and patients with suggestive signs of symptoms was more effective. =
Among
  the clinical manifestations of Lyme borreliosis, cutaneous involvement is=
 4
  times more frequent than neuroborreliosis and arthritis is less frequent =
in

  and specific for bancroftian filariasis in Egypt. This assay was used in =
a

  endemicity. Antigen testing was performed with finger-prick blood collect=
ed
  during the day from 743 schoolchildren (ages 11-16 years). Students come =
from 5
  villages in Qalubia Governorate, 35 km north-east of Cairo, Egypt. The
  prevalence of filarial antigenaemia in the school was 17.2%. Antigenaemia=
 rates
  in children from the 5 villages were 29, 20, 18, 17 and 10% (non-uniformi=

  significant by chi2 analysis). The data agreed with the Ministry of Healt=
h
  rankings of relative endemicity for the villages based on night blood sur=
veys.
  The village with the highest antigen prevalence in children was surveyed =
one
  year before this study. Prevalence rates of antigenaemia and microfilarae=
mia at
  that time for a different sample of children aged 11-16 years were 33% an=

l
  disease due to infection with an H1N1 virus (A/swine/Eng/195852/92).
  Antigenically, the haemagglutinin (HA) of the H1N7 virus was related most
  closely to the HA of A/USSR/90/77, whilst the neuraminidase (NA) appeared=
 to be
  related most closely to the NA of A/equine/Prague/1/56 (H7N7). Pigs infec=
ted
  experimentally with A/swine/Eng/191973/92 developed mild clinical signs,
  excreted virus into the nasal passages for up to 9 days after infection,
  appeared normal at PM, transmitted the virus to sentinel pigs, but 7 out =
of 8
  pigs failed to seroconvert. It is suggested that the H1N7 virus has a low
  pathogenicity for pigs, resulting in limited virus multiplication which i=

AB: Bluetongue virus (BTV) RNA was detected by the polymerase chain reactio=
n
  (PCR) in the blood of 24 naturally infected cattle for as long as 160 day=
s
  after the estimated date of infection. Blood samples from these animals a=
nd
  from 10 experimentally BTV-infected sheep, which also exhibited a prolong=
ed
  haematological BTV RNA presence, were concurrently evaluated for viral
  infectivity. Infectivity analyses were conducted using the sentinel sheep
  inoculation and embryonated chicken egg inoculation procedures. Blood spe=
cimens
  from the experimental sheep taken 50, 56, 71 and 89 days after BTV inocul=
ation
  were uniformly negative for viral infectivity despite their uniformly pos=
itive
  status with PCR evaluation. Three collections of blood from the naturally
  infected cattle at least 100, 135, and 160 days after infection also reve=
aled
  no recoverable viral infectivity but an initially high and progressively
  decreasing prevalence of BTV with the PCR technique. These retrospective
  epidemiological and prospective experimental approaches were concordant i=
n that
  both studies demonstrated consistent discrepancies between the viral
  infectivity and the PCR diagnostic data. The significance of these
  discrepancies is discussed with respect to Koch's postulates and with res=
pect
  to the possibility that the biological vector of BTV (Culicoides variipen=
nis)
  may recover BTV infectivity from PCR-positive but virus isolation-negativ=

AB: A 60 Gy gamma treatment administered to females of G. austeni on day 2 =
or 9
  following emergence, and likewise, a 50 Gy gamma treatment given to pupae=
 on
  day 33 following larviposition, induced complete sterility in the female =
flies
  without altering their mating behaviour. Treated females remained recepti=
ve to
  mating with untreated males up to 15 days following emergence (mating res=
ponse
  of 84%). The timing of treatment (on day 33 post larviposition, on day 2 =
and 9
  following emergence) influenced significantly the dynamics of follicle
  development. Females, irrespective of their age when treatment was receiv=
ed,
  showed a normal development pattern of the follicles in position A1 and C=
1,
  i.e. normal vitellogenesis, maturation and ovulation. Female treated as p=
upae,
  however, revealed no visible signs of a development of follicles in posit=
ion B1
  and D1. From day 15 on, females displayed inactive ovaries characterized =
by
  atrophied oocytes and nurse cells. Treating females on day 2 or 9 of thei=
r
  adult life resulted in various degrees of development of the B1 and D1
  follicles. During laboratory cage tests, untreated males exposed to equal
  numbers of virgin untreated and treated females, showed no significant
  preference to mating with either type of female. A high degree of multipl=
e
  mating was observed when untreated and treated females were offered sever=
al
  mating opportunities. On day 9 following emergence, 24.0% of untreated an=
d
  23.8% of females treated with 60 Gy (on day 2), accepted a male during a =
4th
  mating occasion. The receptivity to remating decreased with a higher radi=
ation
  dose (120 Gy) and when treatment was given later in the female life (day =
5).
  The results of the laboratory experiments are discussed in view of deploy=
ing
  gamma sterilized female G. austeni for entomological monitoring in those =
areas
  where low fly densities exist and especially, to expose potential relic f=
ly
  pockets after control operations have been completed.

  Territory of Australia. Sequence analyses of the amplified BTV genes
  differentiated endemic Australian and exotic viruses. Two potential exoti=
c BTV
  were detected as a result of PCR analyses of blood from sentinel animals =
and of
  the insect vector, Culicoides wadai. The detection of BTV in C. wadai was=
 the
  first direct demonstration of the presence of BTV in this potential vecto=
r.
  Sequence data were used to differentiate between BTV 20 isolated in 1975 =
and 2
  isolates of the same serotype, isolated in 1992, and indicated that the l=
atter
  were probably a recent incursion into Australia from Indonesia; they had
  greater VP3 sequence homology to the BTV 9 (Java) than to Australian isol=
ates.
  PCR, by using rapid sequencing techniques, significantly reduced the time=
 taken
  for diagnosis from a clinical isolate.

AB: An outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) occurred during April 1991 =
in a
  trypanosomiasis sentinel cattle herd by the Rifa River to the east of Lak=
e
  Kariba, Zimbabwe. Despite the cattle having been vaccinated biannually fo=
r the
  previous 5 years the disease was severe. The viruses isolated from the af=
fected
  animals were typed as FMD virus type SAT 1. Free-living African buffalo w=
hich
  had been using the same watering place as the affected cattle were sample=
d and
  FMD type SAT 1 virus was isolated. Partial nucleotide sequencing of the g=
ene
  coding for the capsid protein 1D (VP1) of one of the viruses isolated fro=
m
  cattle and 2 of the viruses isolated from buffalo detected a close relati=
onship
  between the 3 viruses. Since no other cattle were present in the area and=
 no
  outbreaks of SAT 1 had occurred in Zimbabwe since 1989, it was concluded =
that
  the disease had been transmitted from buffalo to cattle.

  tsutsugamushi were discovered by exposing Microtus montebelli as sentinel
  animals on the ground at Hitsujiyama Park, Chichibu City, Saitama Prefect=
ure,
  Japan, in November 1985. From wild rodents (Apodemus speciosus) captured =
around
  the foci, engorged larvae of L. pallidum were collected and successfully =
reared
  by feeding on fresh eggs of Collembola. Four laboratory colonies of L. pa=
llidum
  positive for the Karp strain of R. tsutsugamushi were established, and ve=
rtical
  transmission from the parental generation (P) to F3 in these family lines=
 was
  examined by isolating rickettsiae from individual mites through passage i=
nto
  mice. From F1 to F3 in 4 family lines, a total of 115 unfed larvae, 53 ad=
ult
  females and 51 adult males were examined for rickettsiae. Only 6 males we=
re
  negative and all others were positive for R. tsutsugamushi. The rate of
  transovarial transmission from P to F1, F1 to F2, and F2 to F3 generation=
s were
  100%, and filial infection rates of their offspring were nearly 100%.
  Spermatophores from infected males were examined for rickettsiae and all =
of 78
  spermatophores were negative for R. tsutsugamushi. Furthermore, each of 7=
 R.
  tsutsugamushi-positive males was mated with each of 7 rickettsiae-negativ=

  females, and a total of 227 unfed larvae were obtained from these females=
. R.
  tsutsugamushi was not isolated or detected from any of these larvae. It w=
as
  concluded that R. tsutsugamushi-positive males did not play any significa=

  role in the vertical transmission of R. tsutsugamushi; the rickettsia was
  transmitted to the next generation only through the eggs of R. tsutsugamu=

  monitored for antibodies to vesicular stomatitis New Jersey serotype (VSN=
J)
  virus from 17 April to 27 August 1990. Seroconversions to VSNJ virus were
  detected in 24% of pigs throughout the island. Differences in the inciden=
ce of
  seroconversion were detected between pigs sampled in the Pleistocene and
  Holocene formations of the island suggesting that the presence of virus i=
s
  forest type dependent. Based on the consistency in onset and spatial
  distribution of seroconversions with data from 1981 to 1985, it was concl=
uded
  that this is a very stable host-parasite system. Sequential virus isolati=
on
  attempts from nasal swabs, tonsil swabs, and blood were made on a subsamp=
le of
  54 sentinel pigs from 9 May to 4 July 1990. The VSNJ virus was isolated f=
rom 5
  pigs from 16 May to 20 June. Vesicular lesions were detected on 2 of thes=
e
  animals. Although infections in these feral pigs were short-lived (< 7 da=
ys)
  and were followed by a strong neutralizing antibody response, VSNJ virus =
was
  detected in a single group of pigs for a period exceeding 1 month. It is
  concluded that feral pigs could provide a source of virus to feeding arth=
ropods
  for extended periods of time. The failure to detect a viraemia in these
  animals, however, indicates that a source other than blood may be require=
d for
  transmission to occur.

AB: Bagous affinis has potential as a biological control agent for undergro=

and
  establish was investigated at 2 sites in northern California; a pond in
  Calaveras County and the Chowchilla River in Madera County. In cage studi=
es
  conducted at the pond, B. affinis survived 2 winters (1991-92 and 1992-93=
).
  After releases at the pond, B. affinis successfully reproduced and surviv=
ed
  during summer 1992. Weevil larvae damaged both sentinel and native tubers=
 at
  the site. In the spring, following the release of B. affinis at the pond,=
 a
  light trap and baited shelter traps were used to detect weevils that had
  overwintered naturally at the site. No weevils were recovered. At the
  Chowchilla River site, B. affinis failed to establish, possibly due to a =
lack
  of tubers in the section of the river where the releases were made.

n
  batch, which was thawed and frozen on about 6 occasions over 4 years, pro=
duced
  gradually decreasing antibody titres as detected in ELISA. Regardless of
  whether the initial titres were high or low, all reactants from the first
  vaccinated group remained ELISA seropositive for at least 5 years. The fi=
fth
  -year ELISA titres were still >1:1000 in 70% and 1:100-1:1000 in 30% of t=
ested
  sheep. Local reactions to vaccination were minimal in the sheep. General
  reactions were not observed. A second administration of the vaccine to 3 =
sheep
  did not elicit more serious vaccination reactions. 43 sentinel sheep rema=
ined
  ELISA seronegative throughout the observation period.

AB: A digoxigenin-labelled cloned infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV)=
 DNA
  fragment was evaluated as a non-radioactive alternative probe in the diag=
nosis
  of infectious laryngotracheitis. The dot-blot hybridization protocol was
  optimized and was capable of detecting 40 pg of purified ILTV DNA and as =
few as
  50 ILTV-infected chicken embryo liver cells. The diagnostic use of this
  approach was evaluated through 4 ILTV inoculation trials using a mild fie=
ld
  isolate, a virulent challenge strain, a tissue-culture-origin vaccine, an=
d an
  egg-origin vaccine. Birds were examined for clinical signs of ILT, and
  conjunctival and pharyngeal swabs from inoculated and sentinel birds were
  tested for ILTV by the digoxigenin-labelled probe and by virus isolation.=
 In
  general, higher numbers of ILTV positive samples were detected by both as=
says
  from conjunctival swabs. For the non-vaccine strains, detection by dot-bl=
ot
  -hybridization was equivalent to that for virus isolation. However, for t=
he 2
  vaccine strains, there was some lack of correlation between the dot-blot
  results and the virus-isolation results. The kappa values between virus
  -isolation results and dot-blot results for the tissue-culture-origin vac=
cine,
  egg-origin vaccine, Ont 1596 field isolate, and virulent strain were 0.00=
,
  0.16, 0.39 and 0.24, respectively, for pharyngeal samples and 0.19, 0.29,=

rom
  10.9% (range 0-27.5%) in 1987 to 2.5% (range 0-14.2%) in 1988. Correlatio=
n
  analyses between the number of female copepods and fungal infection rates=
 in
  sentinel mosquitoes were significant (P>0.01) for Acanthocyclops robustus=
 but
  insignificant for 8 other species. Infections obtained in sentinel larvae
  placed in the ponds for 3-h intervals indicated that C. punctatus infecte=
d
  larvae around sundown. Infection rates for field-collected larvae increas=
ed
  with the stage of larval development. However, experiments with sentinel =
larvae
  showed that early instars were more susceptible to infection than later
  instars, suggesting that the higher infection rates in late instars resul=
ted
  from individual larvae being infected by 2 or more zygotes during larval
  development. Standard multiple regression analyses, used to determine the
  relationship between seasonal infection rates and water chemistry, weathe=
r
  variables, and the abundance of early and late instar larvae, showed that=
 the
  abundance of late instars was the only independent variable common to lin=
ear
  models. The models only accounted for 20 and 9% of the variation in larva=
l
  infection rates for 1987 and 1988, respectively. These results indicate t=
hat of
  the parameters examined, the seasonal abundance of the copepod A. robustu=
s was
  the most important factor (or variable) correlated with the prevalence of
  mosquito infection.

  mosquito larvae. Mosquito infection occurred primarily around dusk, the s=

  the surface of the pond. However, exposure of A. robustus, E. serrulatus,
  Macrocyclops albidus, Mesocyclops edax, Microcyclops varicans and Paracyc=
lops
  poppei to fungal meiospores in the laboratory showed that only A. robustu=

  Mesocyclops edax were competent intermediate hosts for C. punctatus. Labo=
ratory
  studies of the diel periodicity of gametangial dehiscence in A. robustus =
and M.
  edax infected with C. punctatus revealed that gamete release and zygote
  formation also occurred around dusk. The combined results of the laborato=
ry and
  field studies on copepod abundance, susceptibility to infection, and
  periodicity of gametangial dehiscence suggested that A. robustus was the
  principal intermediate host for C. punctatus during the epizootic, though=
 it is
  probable that M. edax also contributed importantly to the overall rate of
  larval infection.

AB: Patterns of hyperparasitism of cocoons of Cotesia melanoscela [C.
  melanoscelus], a parasitoid of Lymantria dispar, in southern Ontario were
  studied by periodic sampling of naturally occurring cocoons found under b=
urlap
  bands and by deploying laboratory-produced sentinel cocoons on bark discs=
. At
  least 6 species of hyperparasitoids were recovered. The most common speci=
es of
  hyperparasitoids showed definite associations with sampling method and wi=
th red
  or white oak trees [Quercus rubra and Q. alba]. Hyperparasitism of C.
  melanoscelus began in early June and persisted throughout the summer. The=
 peak
  activity of hyperparasitoids was recorded in late June and early July and=
 was
  coincident with the maximum number of available natural C. melanoscelus c=
ocoons
  in diapause. The probability of C. melanoscelus survival during any singl=
e
  sampling interval declined steadily over the sampling period (14 June-3 A=
ugust
  1989). During this sampling period, 95.9% of the available C. melanoscelu=
s
  cocoons were killed by hyperparasitoids. This estimate of hyperparasitism=
 is a
  minimum rate for Ontario; cocoons not attacked by the end of the sampling
  period were in diapause and thus were vulnerable to hyperparasitism for u=
p to
  10 months after sampling ended.

AB: The effect of the fungus Entomophaga maimaiga on populations of Lymantr=
ia
  dispar was investigated by assessing the prevalence of disease in larvae
  collected from forest plots in Connecticut in 1990 and in laboratory-rear=
ed,
  sentinel larvae exposed in wire cages in the same plots. Large amounts of
  rainfall in May appeared to be critical for development of the fungus. Un=
der
  favourable conditions, infection rates averaged 5% or less in May, but re=
ached
  40% or more in June. Infective conidia were produced in May, while restin=
g
  spores became increasingly common within dead cadavers in June. E. maimai=
ga was
  slightly more prevalent in forest-collected larvae from irrigated portion=
s of
  the sites, and was significantly more prevalent in caged larvae in the
  irrigated areas. Infection rates also varied between plots, and were corr=
elated
  with density of L. dispar and tree composition. Using a day-degree model,
  estimates of daily recruitment and death of fungus-infected larvae were
  obtained. Recruitment in May was not related to precipitation, possibly b=
ecause
  of abundant rainfall, but in June recruitment was correlated with the spo=
radic
  rainfall that occurred then. Data on recruitment and death were used to
  construct survival curves for larvae. Only a few to over half the larvae
  survived the fungus epizootic in different plots.

AB: The Carbo-Flo water effluent treatment process uses a simple flocculati=
on
  and filtration system which requires no specialized personnel for its eff=

  use. Treatment is carried out using pre-weighed/pre-packed materials desi=
gned
  to treat 1000 litres of diluted spray liquor. The flocculation and settle=
ment
  process takes a min. of 1 h, and filtration through 1 coarse gravel and 2=
 fine
  carbon filters takes approx. 2 h. Water containing atrazine, alachlor and
  permethrin were processed through the specially designed Sentinel system.
  Trials using both single products and a 3-way mix were performed. Analysi=
s of
  the treated water at different points in the system was carried out using=
 GC.
  All treatments resulted in >99.9% of the pesticides being removed from th=
e end
  water. Water thus treated can be recycled for subsequent use as rinse wat=
er or
  may be discharged into a soakaway. All solid waste from the process can b=
e
  incinerated. The carbon filters can be regenerated. Some possible user pr=
oblems
  with the flocculation process were encountered and investigated. Adequate
  dilution of the pesticide waste liquor was found to be essential for the
  process to be completely efficient.

  sentinel cattle. Group specific agar gel immunodiffusion tests were carri=
ed out
  for the detection of antibodies to bluetongue (serotype 20), epizootic
  haemorrhagic disease (serotype 2) and Palyam (D'Aguilar) viruses. Serum
  neutralization tests were carried out for the detection of antibodies to
  Akabane and Douglas viruses. During April 1990, light traps were set up o=
n each
  of the properties where the cattle were to be tested and run for 3 nights=
 on 2
  different occasions. 25 suspect arbovirus cases were reported (in 10 catt=

  serology. A total of 2027 serum samples was tested; all were negative for
  antibodies against the 5 arboviruses tested. The total number of insects
  collected and identified to family level was 15 019. No Culicoides specim=

  were recorded. Large numbers of Psychodidae and a very small number of
  mosquitoes were collected. It was concluded that New Zealand was free of =
both

  the mosquito larvae were morphologically indistinguishable from L. gigant=

  -PDCH did not cause mortality at any of the dosages tested. CIB 79-MED an=
d CIB
  79-TDT showed lower pathogenicity than the North American isolates at the=

AB: Culicoides variipennis, the only proven vector of bluetongue virus (BLU=
) in
  the western hemisphere, was evaluated as a vector of bluetongue virus ser=
otype
  2 (BLU 2). This serotype was isolated from sentinel cattle in south Flori=
da at
  a site devoid of C. variipennis. C. variipennis readily fed on a mixture =
of
  defibrinated blood and BLU 2 through chicken skin membrane. An infection =
rate
  of 46.2% was obtained. A growth curve of virus titres recovered from oral=
ly
  infected flies showed a linear relationship between the virus titres and =
the
  period of extrinsic incubation. C. variipennis also became infected when
  inoculated intrathoracically with BLU 2. Peak titres were higher and more
  rapidly attained in inoculated flies when compared with orally infected f=
lies.
  Infected C. variipennis also transmitted BLU 2 to sheep via bite. These r=
esults
  demonstrate that C. variipennis is a potential biological vector of BLU 2=
 in
  the laboratory. The implication of this for epidemiology is that BLU 2 sh=
ould
  have become more widespread in ruminants in the USA. The fact that this h=
as not
  occurred during the past 10 years is discussed.

AB: African swine fever appeared for the first time in Belgium on March 8th
  1985. In the course of 3 months 12 outbreaks were recorded. The disease
  occurred in one of the most dense pig populations in the world. Neverthel=
ess
  its spread was confined to a small region. Thorough epidemiological inqui=
ries
  revealed the source of infection. The virus was believed to have been
  introduced into the country by feeding a boar with a meat product brought=
 home
  from abroad by a tourist. Further spread of the disease was caused by dir=
ect
  contact, i.e. the transport of infected piglets or indirect personal cont=
act.
  All pigs (a total of 35 000) on farms with outbreaks and on 48 high risk =
farms
  were destroyed. After disinfection and before repopulating, "sentinel" pi=
glets
  were placed on the farms. Some 500 pig-farms were kept under close survei=
llance
  as a result of the epidemiological research. Restrictions were also place=
d on
  moving of pigs in the surrounding area. The measures were gradually allev=
iated
  or abolished after a massive serological screening of all 3813 farms in t=
he
  infected area. All measures, except the export of fresh pig-meat produced
  during a certain period in the infected area, were abolished on September=
 23rd
  1985.

sease
  was carried out during a Japanese encephalitis (JE) epidemic in the North
  Central province of Sri Lanka (in November-December 1987) and a subsequen=
t non
  -epidemic year (1988). The epidemic involved 361 cases of human encephali=
tis
  virologically confirmed by IgM ELISA, and was preceded 2-3 weeks earlier =
by
  sentinel pig seroconversion. Virus isolation and viral antigen detection
  (ELISA) in field-caught mosquitoes incriminated Culex tritaeniorhynchus a=
nd C.
  gelidus as the major vectors of virus transmission during the porcine
  amplification and human 'spill-over' phases of the epidemic. Virus was al=
so
  demonstrated in C. fuscocephala, C. whitmorei and Mansonia uniformis duri=
ng the
  epidemic. The major difference between the epidemic (1987) and non-epidem=
ic
  (1988) years was a lower vector biomass and lower rates of virus carriage=
 in
  the mosquito population.

AB: In a series of studies conducted over a 4-year period in Nebraska, USA,=
 the
  effectiveness of releases of pteromalid wasps for the control of Musca

ed
  using sentinel house fly pupae (artificially reared and placed in the
  environment) and naturally occurring house fly and stable fly pupae. The =
2
  methods were compared using percentage parasitoid emergence and species
  composition. At confinements where no parasitoid releases occurred, paras=
itoid
  emergence was significantly higher from naturally occurring hosts. Muscid=
ifurax
  zaraptor comprised 97 and 76% of the parasitoids recovered from sentinel =
and
  naturally occurring hosts, respectively. Spalangia spp. made up 16% of th=
e
  parasitoids from naturally occurring hosts. Few Spalangia spp. were recov=
ered
  from sentinel hosts. Similar results were obtained from locations where M=
.
  zaraptor was released, except that M. zaraptor comprised a greater propor=
tion
  of the parasitoids recovered by both methods. At locations where S. camer=
oni
  was released, 76% of the parasitoids recovered from sentinel hosts were M=
.
  zaraptor, and 21% were S. cameroni, compared with 62% M. zaraptor and 34%=
 S.
  cameroni from naturally occurring hosts. At locations where Pachycrepoide=
us
  vindemmiae was released, this species was recovered significantly more of=
ten
  from sentinel hosts. Naturally occurring pupal methods appears to be more
  reliable and sensitive to the entire parasitoid species complex. However,
  because of the difficulty in obtaining adequate samples, it is recommende=
d that
  both methods be employed.

  infectious bursal disease (IBD) in broiler chickens from a commercial pou=

  company. Bursa of fabricii (BF) from 2 vaccinated and 3 nonvaccinated bro=
iler
  flocks were evaluated histologically, and antibody profiles of these broi=
ler
  and matched parent breeder flocks were established. Lesions of IBD, inclu=
ding
  lymphoid necrosis, stromal oedema, and infiltrates of heterophils and
  macrophages, were first detected in BF at 24 days of age in both vaccinat=
ed and
  nonvaccinated chickens. At 41 days, all BF had lesions characteristic of =
IBD,
  including severe lymphoid depletion, proliferation of epithelial cells, a=
nd
  mild fibroplasia. Although mean maternal antibody levels (measured by enz=
yme
  -linked immunosorbent assay) in broilers were apparently protective until=
 day
  12, IBD antibodies decreased to nonprotective levels (below 1000) by day =
16 or
  20. Titres began to increase by day 28 or 32 because of field exposure.
  Sentinel birds, placed with broiler flocks, also developed IBD antibody t=
itres.
  Broiler breeders had low and nonuniform antibody titres. Prevalence of fi=
eld
  IBD exposure was high, and existing vaccination programmes were not effec=

AB: A study was conducted during an inundative release programme at a comme=

raptor
  and Urolepis rufipes were released weekly for 7 weeks. Dispersal behaviou=
r was
  monitored by parasitism rates of lab-reared housefly (Musca domestica) pu=
pae
  exposed in sentinel bags placed in a variety of locations. Muscidifurax r=
aptor,
  which was released inside the barn, parasitized housefly pupae both insid=
e and
  outside, and it achieved highest rates of parasitism in indoor straw calf
  -bedding and in outdoor manure and silage. U. rufipes, which was released
  outside the barn, did not attack pupae inside tha barn, and its highest r=
ates
  of parasitism occurred in outdoor silage and manure. Interspecific compet=
ition
  did not appear to explain these distribution patterns. Warm weather coinc=
ided
  with a peak in parasitism rate at samples located on walls, suggesting a =
higher
  flight activity. Cool weather interrupted parasitism at the sites on wall=
s but
  not in the various fly-breeding substrates. M. raptor appear to be more
  effective than U. rufipes in parasitizing pupae located at sites where na=
tural
  fly-breeding occurred. High rates of parasitism by M. raptor near open do=
orways
  and at outdoor sites 30 m away suggests that they were dispersing through=
out
  the barn and its immediate surroundings.

AB: Data on arboviruses in Manitoba, Canada, are compiled for a 17-year per=
iod,
  1975-91. Western equine encephalitis virus is endemic in Manitoba, yet
  epidemics/epizootics develop infrequently, with 4 epidemics recorded duri=
ng the
  study period: 1975, 1977, 1981 and 1983. A multi-disciplinary surveillanc=
e was
  started in 1975 and remained active for 10 years, during which mosquito
  populations, especially those of Culex tarsalis, mosquito arboviral infec=
tion
  rates and seroconversion in sentinel chicken flocks were monitored in a n=
umber
  of locations throughout Manitoba. In addition, serosurveys were done on
  potential reservoir hosts, and serologically confirmed equine and human c=
ases
  were recorded. After 1986, the surveillance was limited to the City of Wi=
nnipeg
  data on mosquito populations and seroconversion in chicken flocks. Crude
  criteria were developed to forecast epidemics and were successful in pred=
icting
  the 1977, 1981 and 1983 outbreaks. Experience has shown that multiple
  parameters are needed for monitoring arboviral outbreaks, and that the mo=
nth of
  July is critical in predicting epidemics. It is proposed that a multi
  -disciplinary surveillance be re-instituted, and that 1-2 locations be
  monitored for mosquito populations and infection rates, as well as for
  seroconversion in chickens. If funds are limited, the surveillance could =
be
  restricted to a 4-6 week period, including the month of July.

AB: Two commercial Aujeszky's disease vaccines, a modified killed vaccine a=
nd a
  sub-unit vaccine, both carrying a deletion of glycoprotein-I, were evalua=
ted in
  pigs. Each vaccine was administered to 2 groups of 4 pigs, twice at 4-wee=
k
  intervals, with 2 pigs held as unvaccinated controls. All pigs were chall=
enged
  with a New Zealand field isolate of Aujeszky's disease virus 3 weeks afte=
r the
  second vaccination. The sub-unit vaccine was able to protect pigs against
  clinical Aujeszky's disease much better than the pigs vaccinated with the
  modified killed vaccine when challenged with a virulent virus. However, t=
he
  amount and the duration of virulent virus excretion following challenge w=
as
  greater with the sub-unit vaccine than the modified killed vaccine. Pigs
  vaccinated with the sub-unit vaccine were shown to be latently infected
  following challenge. Latent infection was demonstrated by excretion of
  Aujeszky's disease virus from the nasal cavity after dexamethasone treatm=
ent
  and seroconversion of a sentinel in-contact pigs to Aujeszky's disease vi=

AB: Chuzan disease, which is characterized by a hydranencephaly-cerebellar
  hypoplasia (HCH) syndrome in calves, occurred in the Kyushu district of J=
apan
  during the period November 1985 to April 1986. The aetiological agent of =
Chuzan
  virus was isolated from blood of sentinel cattle and Culicoides oxystoma =
in the
  period September to October 1985, and classified as a new member of the P=
alyam
  subgroup of the genus Orbivirus. The main clinical abnormalities of the d=
isease
  are impaired mobility and nervous signs. Almost all the affected calves c=
ould
  not suck by themselves and some showed central nervous symptoms. Gross le=
sions
  of the affected calves were confined to the brain. The HCH syndrome was
  observed at a high rate. On the basis of virological and sero-epidemiolog=
ical
  investigations and experimental infections with pregnant cows, it was con=
firmed
  that Chuzan virus was the cause of CHC syndrome of calves. The sero
  -epidemiological survey indicated that antibody to Chuzan virus was prese=
nt at
  a high rate in the Kyushu district, while it was at a low rate in the Chu=
goku
  and Shikoku districts. The antibody was not found in the east and northea=
stern
  region of Japan. The sero-epidemiological investigations strongly suggest=
ed
  that Chuzan virus came to the main islands of Japan from the southeast As=
ian
  countries through Okinawa. To control this disease in Japan, an inactivat=
ed
  vaccine is planned for practical use in the field in the near future.

  including virus isolation, was continued at the same site. 40 viral isola=
tes
  were recovered from blood samples collected from sentinel cattle in 1990 =
and 7
  that were identified as bluetongue virus by the immuno-dot blotting test =
were
  subsequently identified as serotypes 1, 9, 12, 21 (2 isolates) and 23. Th=
e
  dates of collection of the specimens yielding isolates showed that there =
was a
  tendency for different serotypes to be circulating in the environment at
  different times. The isolates were all from different cattle. It is sugge=
sted
  that further intensive studies of sentinel cattle could help in the
  understanding of the epidemiology of the disease in the region.

AB: The ability of PRRS virus to induce a persistent infection in nursery p=
igs
  was demonstrated, and the establishment of contact infection was compared=
 in
  groups of sentinel pigs placed into contact with infected pigs at differe=
nt
  intervals. Sixteen 3-week-old pigs from a farm free of PRRS were divided =
into 4
  equal groups. Four pigs were moved into an isolation room and inoculated
  intranasally with PRRS virus (principal group). Thereafter, 3 sentinel gr=
oups
  of 4 pigs each were placed into the room in contact with principal pigs, =
so
  that the 3 sentinel groups were placed in contact on days 3, 10, and 24 p=
ost
  -inoculation (PI), respectively. Clinical signs were not observed in any =
of the
  pigs. Viraemia was evident in principal pigs from 3-35 days PI. In the se=
ntinel
  groups, the duration of viraemia varied among groups: pigs placed in cont=
act
  later in the course of the experiment had a shorter viraemic period. Vira=
emia
  was not detected in 2 of 4 pigs of sentinel group 3. Duration of virus sh=
edding
  through nasal secretion and faeces was similar to the duration of viraemi=
a for
  pigs in each group, but virus recovery from nasal and faecal samples was
  inconsistent compared with virus recovered from the blood. PRRS virus ant=
ibody
  was detected by indirect-fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay in every pig so=
on
  after the onset of viraemia, and the viraemia was maintained at high anti=
body
  levels. The variables in the carrier status are discussed and different
  management practices that may reduce the opportunity for pig-to-pig
  transmission of PRRS virus on endemically infected farms are suggested.

AB: The incidences of primary bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV)
  infection and reinfection were monitored, monthly by ELISA, in 884 dairy
  cattle, over 2 months of age, in 6 herds in the Netherlands, from August =
1990
  to September 1991. 155 cattle, most under 2 years of age, had a primary
  antibody response. Rising antibody titres were found in 259 cattle of all=
 ages.
  The highest incidences of BRSV infections were found during one period in
  either autumn or winter. Primary infections were rare in other seasons, w=
hereas
  reinfections were not uncommon. In 5 of 6 herds, 2 seronegative sentinel =
calves
  were introduced at the end of winter and none developed specific antibodi=
es
  before the next winter. This strongly suggests that, in spite of regular
  reinfections, BRSV circulates during spring and summer at very low levels=
 or
  not at all. Persistent BRSV infection in a number of cows might be a mean=
s for
  the virus to survive during the summer, but a steady rate of reinfection =
of
  seropositive cows throughout the year at a low level might also maintain =
a
  reservoir of infectious virus. The frequency and timings of primary infec=
tions
  and reinfections of BRSV in these herds may be useful in the study of hum=
an RSV.

  months. Sporadic infestations occurred in winter and spring, while peaks =
were
  reached in summer and autumn. Development of O. ovis larvae deposited in =
autumn
  was retarded for up to 5.5 months. Pupae of O. ovis formed on 27 April-9
  August, with the exception of a single pupa formed on 29 June, failed to
  produce flies. Pupal periods ranged from 30 days in January to 80 days in=
 June.
  Strategic anthelmintic treatments (with ivermectin) in May, August and No=

SO: Parasitology. 1991, 103: 3, 429-438; 17 ref.
PY: 1991
LA: English
AB: BALB/c mice were characterized as more resistant to infection with H.
  polygyrus than C57BL/6 mice based on lower establishment and survival dur=
ing a
  primary infection and stronger protection induced by an immunizing regime=
. It
  was hypothesized, therefore, that C57BL/6 mice would be more heavily infe=
cted
  than BALB/c mice when they lived together as a single population in a lar=
ge
  indoor arena where transmission occurred through contact between the mice=
 and
  damp peat trays where parasite eggs developed into larvae. 50 female mice
  (including 5 infected mice) of each strain were placed in a 3.2 X 0.8 m a=
rena.
  Net egg production and numbers of larvae acquired by sentinel mice of eac=
h
  strain were monitored every 2 weeks. The experiment was replicated twice.=
 The
  results did not support the hypothesis. No difference was detected betwee=
n
  strains of mice in the number of larvae acquired by sentinel mice during =
24 h
  exposure periods, or in the numbers of worms present after 12 or 23 weeks=
. Net
  egg production was also comparable between strains. A hypothesis that the
  unexpected similarity of infection in the 2 strains was related to differ=
ences
  in rates of contact with the peat trays was not supported by preliminary =
data
  on mouse behaviour that revealed equal frequency of contact with peat tra=
ys
  between strains. A 2nd hypothesis that continuous exposure to larvae led =
to
  similar infection levels in the 2 strains (in contrast to the controlled
  characterization experiments) was also unsupported. Mice were infected we=
ekly
  with 10, 50 or 100 larvae for 5 or 10 weeks. Net egg production and numbe=
rs of
  worms were consistently higher in C57BL/6 than BALB/c mice. It is not cle=
ar why
  infection in the 2 strains was virtually identical in the large arenas bu=
t
  clearly distinct in all controlled infection experiments.

AB: The results of a field trial of the sterile insect release method for t=
he
  control of C. bezziana are described. The trial was conducted in the Safi=
a
  Valley, Papua New Guinea, during August-September 1989 (although original=
ly
  planned for 6 months, the trial had to be abandoned 5 weeks after the fir=
st
  release due to civil unrest in the valley). Aerial releases involved twic=
e
  -weekly releases of fluorescently-marked sterilized flies. Swormlure-bait=
ed
  traps and sentinel cattle served to monitor fly numbers. A total of 9 rel=
eases
  was possible before the trial ended. During this period, 1.07 million ste=
rile
  male flies were released over the valley at an average of 309 males/km2/w=
eek.
  On average, 13 native female C. bezziana were trapped each week during th=
e 6
  weeks that trapping was possible. During this time only one native male f=
ly was
  trapped. Only one trapping period was possible after the start of release=
s.
  During this week, 49 female and 14 male flies from the first 2 releases a=
nd 5
  females and one male from the 3rd release were recaptured. Before the rel=
eases
  started, 163 egg masses were collected, of which one was sterile. From th=
e day
  of the first release (7th August) until the trial ended, 144 egg masses w=
ere
  recorded in 3 trapping periods. No sterile egg masses were found in the f=
irst
  10 days after releases commenced. After this, it was not possible to moni=
tor
  sentinel cattle until 8-11 days after releases ceased. During this period=
, 87
  egg masses were collected, of which 25 were sterile. Despite the problems
  encountered during the trial, the author concludes that the data show tha=
t
  sterile insect release has the potential to be effective in controlling C=
.
  bezziana populations.

  as attractants to study movements of Cochliomyia hominivorax in a Costa R=

  sexes than did wounds, but proportionately fewer gravid and parous female=
s.
  Only 24.6% of females marked at liver sites were recaptured; seldom (3.1%=
) did
  they visit sheep wounds. Females originally marked at sheep wounds remain=
ed at
  the study site longer, visited both sheep and liver sites, and >50% were
  recaptured. Some females were observed fror 16 days and one laid 4 clutch=
es of
  eggs. Only 8% of the marked males were recaptured and none was recaptured=
 <2
  days later. Only a small proportion of the adult screwworms at a locality
  visited wounds on sentinel sheep; the majority of the adults were transie=

AB: Egg masses from wild populations of Cochliomyia hominivorax were obtain=
ed by
  collecting females from rotted liver (in Costa Rica), holding them for 3 =
days
  until egg maturation and then placing them on heated ground beef for
  oviposition. Nearly 50% of the females oviposited. Fertility of egg masse=
s was
  66 and 95% at the 2 collection sites. Decreased fertility was associated =
with
  collections of virgin females. Average weight =B1 SD of the egg masses wa=
s
  13.7=B11.40 mg; the number of eggs per mass averaged 343. This method of
  obtaining egg masses from wild screwworm females is a cost-effective, sen=
sitive
  alternative to the use of sentinel animals in the field. The use of rotte=
d
  liver costs less, takes less time, and takes less equipment than the
  traditional sentinel animal technique.

AB: During 1978-85, a total of 96 167 ixodid ticks was collected (mostly fr=
om
  Kindia and Telimele prefectures) in Guinea and examined for arboviruses. =
94
  Arbovirus isolates were made, viz.: 4 of Bhanja virus; 9 of Crimean-Congo
  haemorrhagic fever virus; 20 of Dugbe virus; 24 of Jos virus; 10 of Abadi=
na
  virus; 7 of bluetongue virus; 1 of Bunyamwera virus; 1 of chikungunya vir=
us
  (the first report of this virus in ticks - found in Amblyomma variegatum)=
; 1 of
  Kindia virus; and 2 of Forecariah virus (these last 2 were new to science=
). The
  remaining 15 isolates could not be identified. A. variegatum proved to be=
 the
  largest single source of the virus isolates (74/94), followed by Boophilu=
s spp.
  (16/94), Rhipicephalus spp. (6/94) and Haemaphysalis spp. (1/94). A. vari=
egatum
  was shown to be the vector of Abadina virus after field work and laborato=
ry
  studies, and the seasonal dynamics of the circulation of this virus and i=
ts
  pathogenicity in livestock are described. Examination of some 7000 sera f=
rom
  sentinel calves showed that circulation was most active for Abadina,
  bluetongue, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever and Dugbe viruses (24-35% of=
 sera
  positive). No more than 0.9% of sera were positive for Bhanja, Forecariah=
, Jos
  and Rift Valley fever viruses. During the period of the study, tickborne
  arboviruses played a negligible role in human infection in Guinea. Maps g=

AB: A monoclonal antibody solution hybridization (MASH) assay was developed=
 to
  detect faecal excretion of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). The assay used a
  biotinylated cDNA probe to detect viral RNA target sequences by hybridiza=
tion
  in solution, capture of hybrids on the solid phase with antibiotin antibo=
dy,
  and immunoassay with an enzyme-labelled monoclonal antibody specific for =
DNA
  -RNA hybrids. The MASH assay was used to monitor the time course of
  enterotropic MHV excretion after oronasal inoculation. Infectivity of the
  inoculated mice was simultaneously monitored with sentinel animals. The M=
ASH
  assay detected MHV excretion in all inoculated mice, with the highest mea=
n
  excretion levels occurring from day 3 to day 9 after inoculation. Mean
  excretion then decreased gradually to below detection limits by day 21.
  Sentinels became infected on exposure to inoculated mice up to but not af=
ter
  day 21. Infected sentinel mice showed a time course of virus excretion si=
milar
  to that of inoculated mice. These results indicate that the MASH assay is
  useful for rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of MHV in clinical
  specimens from laboratory mice.

AB: An overview of the circulation of St. Louis encephalitis (SLE), eastern
  equine encephalitis (EEE), western equine encephalitis (WEE), Mucambo (MU=
C) and
  Pixuna (PIX) viruses in Brazilian Amazonia during 1959-87 is presented. I=
nsects
  were caught on human bait and in CDC light traps, and blood samples taken=
 from
  forest animals in areas characterized by road-building and development
  projects. EEE and WEE viruses were detected by serological techniques
  (haemagglutination inhibition, complement fixation and neutralization), w=
hile
  SLE and MUC were detected by either serology or by virus isolation (using
  neonate Swiss white mice). The results are tabulated, with information on
  vertebrate or insect host, location and date of isolation. PIX virus was
  isolated from mosquitoes (Trichoprosopon digitatum and Anopheles nimbus) =
on the
  Brasilia-Belem road and from the viscera of Proechimys guyannensis caught=
 near
  Belem; the single human infection (acquired in 1961) is thought to have b=
een
  contracted in the laboratory. Antibodies to SLE virus were detected in 86
  species of birds, giving a total prevalence of 3.4% for the 11 643 birds
  tested; SLE virus was isolated 35 times from mosquitoes (mostly from Cule=
x
  coronator and C. declarator - these 2 species accounted for 5 and 12 of t=
he
  isolations, respectively), once from an armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) =
and
  from the turtles Chelonoidis carbonaria and C. denticulata. MUC virus was
  isolated from forest animals (mostly rodents) a total of 43 times, and fr=
om
  mosquitoes (and, in 1 case, Simulium sp.) 26 times. EEE virus was isolate=
d from
  forest birds 7 times and from mosquitoes 40 times; Culex pedroi and Culex=
 sp.
  accounted for 21 and 12 of these isolates, respectively. WEE virus was de=
tected
  in the sera of 6 species of forest birds and isolated from 3 mosquitoes a=
nd a
  sentinel mouse. These data are discussed in relation to previously publis=
hed
  data on the circulation of arboviruses in the human population in Amazoni=
a, and
  the symptoms caused by these arboviruses in Brazilian patients are compar=
ed to
  those caused by the same viruses in other parts of the Americas, especial=

AB: Over the past decade, a vaccinia-rabies glycoprotein (V-RG) recombinant
  vaccine virus was developed for the potential control of wildlife rabies =
by
  oral immunization in baits. Before widespread field applications in diffe=
rent
  ecological settings, extensive laboratory safety testing was necessary in=
 a
  number of target and non-target species to quantify real or perceived ris=
ks and
  to monitor potential adverse health effects. To mitigate concerns over
  inadvertent human exposure to a vaccine targeted for environmental releas=
e and
  intended for wildlife consumption, it was necessary to study the safety o=
f the
  vaccine in primates following oral consumption and indirectly through
  transdermal administration. No significant differences were observed in t=
he
  comparative pathogenicity of vaccina and vaccinia-recombinant viruses by
  intradermal scarification of squirrel monkeys. In addition, 8 of 11 chimp=
anzees
  given the V-RG vaccine (109 plaque forming units/ml) by mouth developed r=
abies
  virus-neutralizing antibodies. Sentinel chimpanzee controls and human ani=
mal
  handlers did not show evidence of virus exposure. No adverse effects were=
 noted
  in any experimental animals as a result of V-RG vaccine administration.

AB: A blocking (B) dot ELISA, using a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against a g=
roup
  specific antigen of bluetongue virus (BTV) is described for the detection=
 of
  antibodies to BTV in cattle sera. Dots of BTV antigens were absorbed to
  nitrocellulose (NC) strips and/or NC mounted in the windows of dipsticks.=
 After
  blocking the remaining sites of the NC paper with milk powder solution an=
d
  immersion in the test sample, the NC strips and dipsticks were exposed to=
 mAb.
  Bound mAb was detected with peroxidase conjugated anti-mouse IgG (H and L=
). In
  the absence of anti-BTV antibody in the test sample, BTV antigen sites we=
re
  reactive with mAb as indicated by a brown coloured dot in the presence of=
 the
  enzyme substrate, hydrogen peroxide and diaminobenzidine. In the presence=
 of
  sufficient anti-BTV antibodies no colour reaction was observed. The perfo=
rmance
  of these assays in detecting anti-BTV antibody in field blood eluate samp=
les,
  prepared from whole blood dried on filter paper, from 395 bluetongue-free
  cattle in Canada and 635 sentinel cattle in Florida, USA, was evaluated a=
nd
  compared with the standard competitive (C) ELISA. The specificity of the
  dipstick B-dot ELISA was identical to that of the C-ELISA in testing of B=
T-free
  Canadian cattle but not in the testing of samples from the sentinel cattl=
e in
  Florida, resulting in values of 100% diagnostic and 88.9% relative specif=
icity
  respectively. Based on the C-ELISA, the specificity of the NC strip B-dot=
 ELISA
  was low and in the same order as that of the dipstick assay. The sensitiv=
ity of
  dipstick and NC strip assays in testing of 265 samples relative to C-ELIS=
A
  results were 83.2% and 91.3%, respectively. It is concluded that the B-do=
t
  ELISA which is rapid, simple and inexpensive may be an alternative field =
test
  for screening and monitoring cattle, and possibly other ruminants, expose=
d to
  BTV for control and surveillance programs.

 peas
  followed by rapid freezing and freeze-drying increased the proportion of =
starch
  resistant to alpha-amylase (EC 3.2.1.1) without previous treatment with
  dimethyl sulphoxide. There were only minor effects of cooking on the
  digestibilities of non-starch polysaccharides and their constituent sugar=
s.
  With the higher dietary pea concentration there were considerable increas=
es in
  the flow of organic matter to, and fermentation in, the large bowel. Thos=
e
  increases were associated with significant increases in colonic tissue an=
d
  contents weights, and in colonic transit time. Both cooking and dietary p=
ea
  inclusion rate altered the pattern of volatile fatty acids in caecal cont=
ents
  and in portal blood.

AB: The history of mosquito control in Cape May county, New Jersey, from 19=
15
  -1987 is briefly discussed. In the early years of this period control was
  largely by environmental measures (ditching, the use of sluice gates, blo=
cking
  marshes from tides) and by oiling, and concentrated largely on salt marsh
  mosquito species. Since WW2, chemical control has become the mainstay of
  mosquito control operations, although DDT was last used in 1960 and incre=
asing
  environmental awareness has led to strict policing of insecticide usage.
  Currently a mixture of water management techniques and larviciding are us=
ed,
  and experiments on viral sampling (including the use of sentinel flocks, =
CDC
  and New Jersey light traps and pigeon traps) and pesticide usage are perf=
ormed.

AB: In the autumn of 1982, the state of Utah (USA) received record levels o=
f
  precipitation, which led to concern about increased breeding of Culex tar=
salis
  and the possibility of an outbreak of western equine encephalitis (WEE). =
For
  this reason a WEE surveillance scheme using flocks of sentinel chickens w=
as set
  up. Record or higher-than-average levels of rainfall continued from 1983
  through 1986, and seroconversions in the sentinel chickens in these years=
 are
  briefly discussed. In 1987 precipitation was below average, although 5 ch=
ickens
  seroconverted to WEE virus. In 1988, there had been no seroconversions in
  chickens by 22 August. During these 6 years of surveillance, over 16 000 =
sera
  were tested; only 18 seroconversions were detected in chickens, 13 for WE=
E
  virus and 5 for St. Louis encephalitis virus (the first records of this v=
irus
  in Utah) and no human or equine cases occurred.

AB: Data describing mosquito and arbovirus activity in southern California =
in
  1987 are summarized. Culex tarsalis was the most abundant and widespread
  species of mosquito in irrigated agricultural valleys and was focally abu=
ndant
  in residual riparian and marsh habitats in the Los Angeles basin. Floodwa=
ter
  Aedes and Psorophora spp. were not abundant and were restricted to land t=
hat
  had been flood irrigated for agriculture. C. quinquefasciatus and, to a l=
esser
  extent C. peus [?C. stigmatosoma], replaced C. tarsalis in dairy or resid=
ential
  settings where larval habitats were restricted to polluted or peridomesti=
c
  sites. C. erythrothorax was only abundant at marshes supporting dense sta=
nds of
  cattails (Typha spp.). Mosquito activity was bimodal, with peaks in sprin=
g and
  late summer/early autumn. Western equine encephalitis (WEE) virus was act=
ive
  along the Colorado River and in the Coachella Valley with 62 isolations m=
ade
  between 14 January and 19 August, and 37 of 182 sentinel chickens (20%)
  converting serologically. With the exception of one isolation from C.
  quinquefasciatus, all isolations of WEE virus were made from C. tarsalis.=
 St.
  Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus was isolated from Mecca in the Coachella V=
alley,
  Seeley in Imperial Valley and the Sepulveda Basin in Los Angeles County. =
The
  isolation of SLE virus from C. tarsalis in February and the seroconversio=
n of
  sentinel chickens in December suggest that SLE virus may remain active in=
 its
  primary C. tarsalis-bird cycle throughout the winter. It is concluded tha=
t C.
  tarsalis is the primary vector of WEE virus and perhaps of SLE virus in
  southern California.

d the
  sensitivity of 3 avian sentinel systems used in 1987 are compared. The 3
  systems were: sentinel chickens, sentinel pigeons and feral birds. Flocks=
 of 25
  white leghorn chickens and 30 pigeons were housed in chicken wire cages, =
while
  feral birds were collected in Australian crow traps with the size of the
  aperture reduced to exclude large birds. No feral birds produced antibodi=
es to
  SLE virus in Los Angeles county at the sites where the 3 different system=
s were
  located. It was unclear whether this was due to the lower level of virus
  activity or due to the low numbers of feral birds bled. In contrast, posi=
tive
  serologies for SLE virus were found in both pigeons and feral birds in Or=
ange
  county. The detection of antibodies to SLE virus in feral birds and pigeo=
ns may
  indicate that these 2 systems are more sensitive than sentinel chickens, =
in
  which no antibodies were detected. It is suggested that feral birds may b=
e a
  superior tool for SLE virus detection than sentinel chickens, although th=
e data
  reported here are preliminary and further research needs to be done to as=

  the sensitivity and cost effectiveness of sentinel feral birds.

  + piperonyl butoxide] applied aerially (malathion (91%) at 3oz/acre, Scou=
rge at
  0.6 oz plus 2.4 oz soybean oil (3 oz/acre) or at 0.6 oz plus 4.4 oz soybe=
an oil
  (5 oz/acre)) against adults of A. sollicitans was compared to their relat=
ive
  toxicity as determined by topical application of the insecticides to a
  laboratory strain of A. sollicitans (originally isolated from West Creek,=
 Ocean
  County, New Jersey, in 1984) in 1985 and 1986. The efficacies of the fiel=
d
  applications were determined by the use of sentinel cages and in situ
  collection of female mosquitoes at the spray sites. Results of the in sit=
u
  sampling showed that malathion was more effective than Scourge (40-92% vs=
. 0
  -55%, respectively, depending on date and location). It is concluded that
  although Scourge has a lower LD99 than malathion in laboratory bioassays
  against A. sollicitans (3.4 ng/female and 12.6 ng/female respectively), i=
t is
  less efficient when used as a ULV spray in the field because a droplet of
  malathion contains more active ingredient than a droplet of Scourge of th=
e same
  diameter (a 100=B5m of malathion contains _ 587 ng a.i. while one of Scou=
rge
  contains 19 ng of a.i.); as droplets of 5-25 =B5m are thought to be optim=
al in
  terms of bouyancy and their ability to impact on flying mosquitoes, a mos=
quito
  is more likely to acquire a lethal dose encountering an aerial ULV spray =
of
  malathion than one of Scourge. The knockdown effect of Scourge may also p=
lay a
  role, as quick knockdown would essentially remove mosquitoes from further
  contact with a ULV spray. Indirect evidence is cited to support this theo=
ry:
  knockdown often results in leg fracture, and upon entering areas sprayed =
a day
  or 2 previously, the authors observed numerous females of A. sollicitans =
with
  leg fracture flying and host-seeking.

  White Cedar swamp, a mature White Pine stand and a mixed hardwood forest)=
 in
  Cape May County, New Jersey, where eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) viru=

  bled once weekly from June through October for evidence of seroconversion=
 to
  EEE or Highlands J (HJ) virus. Of 3081 C. melanura collected, 1368 were t=
aken
  in the hardwood forest, 1243 in the cedar swamp and 470 in the pine stand=
. Most
  host seeking took place in the canopy in all 3 habitats, and seroconversi=
ons to
  both EEE and HJ virus were found predominantly in canopy stationed birds.=
 This
  canopy feeding behaviour may explain the poor performance of ground stati=

any

ootic
  Rift Valley fever in Zambia, with more than 80% positive. A sentinel herd
  exposed from 1982 to 1986 showed that some Rift Valley fever occurred eac=
h
  year. This was usually at a low level, with 3-8% of the susceptible cattl=
e
  seroconverting. In 1985-86 more than 20% of the animals seroconverted, an=
d this
  greater activity was associated with vegetational changes (which could be
  detected by remote-sensing satellite imagery) which have also been associ=
ated
  with greater virus activity in Kenya.

  River Mosquito Control District. Two types of surveillance data were coll=
ected.
  First, factors predicting the probability of annual SLE transmission were
  tracked year round. These included: annual and daily rainfall patterns
  throughout the county, vector (Culex nigripalpus) and amplification host
  population dynamics, wild bird immunity to SLE, and viral isolation from =
vector
  mosquitoes. Second, factors that proved virus transmission was occurring =
were
  monitored. These included: viral isolation from avian amplification hosts=
, the
  detection of recently acquired antibody from sentinel chickens and wild b=
irds,
  and the incidence of suspected, presumptive and confirmed human SLE cases=

AB: The Indian River Mosquito Control District (IRMCD) has cooperated in a =
St.
  Louis encephalitis (SLE) sentinel chicken surveillance programme since 19=
78.
  Absent or minimal levels of SLE activity were recorded from 1978 to 1988.=
 In
  1989 an unusually large number of seroconversions were confirmed. The 198=
9
  seroconversions, while below levels that trigger various alerts, resulted=
 in a
  major review of IRMCD policy and strategy related to sentinel chicken
  seroconversions. These 1989 seroconversions proved to serve as an early w=
arning
  for 1990, when the most recent Florida SLE epidemic erupted with its epic=
enter
  in Indian River County. While providing invaluable information for epidem=
ic
  response, vector [Culex nigripalpus] control and comparative long-term da=
ta for
  future predictions, several obstacles were encountered in managing the ch=
icken
  flocks during the epidemic. These difficulties included: SLE infections o=
f
  chickens prior to placement in the field, high chicken mortality rates,
  maintaining sufficient chickens in the field to give meaningful data, and
  proper and timely interpretation of seroconversion results.

AB: Studies to determine the persistence of released, sterile females of
  Cochliomyia hominivorax were conducted in Belize, in 1987-1988. A total o=
f 9
  releases were made, each consisting of 4000 females marked with a fluores=
cent
  dust. Previous similar studies with baited fly traps indicated that flies=
 died
  or dispersed from the release site within 3-4 days. For this study, flies=
 were
  recaptured at sentinel animals (sheep). Recaptured rates varied greatly b=
etween
  releases, a result that was not correlated with any weather parameter. Th=
e
  pattern of recapture indicated a sharp drop in the released population af=
ter 9
  -10 days, with a few flies persisting in the release area for up to 3 wee=
ks.
  The results suggest that survival of released sterile flies is comparable=
 with
  estimated survival rate and life span of wild, native flies.

iasis
  were conducted periodically on resident herds in the Biological Control o=

ard
  detection methods. Over a specified period, sentinel herds were also exam=
ined
  in selected locations within the project area. Fly trapping and dissectio=
n were
  similarly used for trypanosome screening of wild and released flies. In b=
oth
  resident and sentinel herds, infections were detected consistently, showi=
ng the
  persistence of the disease throughout the period of survey. Fly trapping =
and
  dissection revealed that the target species, Glossina palpalis palpalis, =
was
  effectively eliminated from the control zone, or may be persisting only a=
t an
  undetectable level. However, G. tachinoides was present in most of these =
areas
  and may therefore have been responsible for the persistence of infection
  (Trypanosoma congolense, T. vivax or T. brucei). Infection among resident=
 herds
  could have also been due to their migratory activities, taking them to ar=
eas
  outside the control project.

AB: St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus has become established in the Los An=
geles
  Basin of California, USA, where it most likely is maintained by horizonta=
l
  transmission among Culex tarsalis and passerine birds in park-riparian ha=
bitat.
  Viral transmission also was detected at low levels in residential habitat=
 by
  the infrequent seroconversion of sentinel chickens. SLE virus activity wa=
s
  documented in all months except March and April. C. tarsalis was incrimin=
ated
  as the primary vector, based on elevated field infection rates (0.17 infe=
cted
  females per 1000 tested), population abundance concomitant in time and sp=
ace
  with increased SLE virus activity, vector competence, and vectorial capac=
ity.
  C. stigmatosoma also may be important in the horizontal maintenance of SL=
E
  virus because this species was an efficient laboratory vector, fed freque=
ntly
  on passeriform birds, and had field infection rates (0.15 females per 100=
0)
  comparable with C. tarsalis. However, difficulty in trapping adult female=
s
  precluded the assessment of C. stigmatosoma because abundance may have be=
en
  underestimated and comparatively few females were tested for virus. Altho=
ugh C.
  quinquefasciatus was the most abundant species in residential habitats (>=
85% of
  total catch at CO2 traps) where it occasionally fed on humans (0.6% of to=
tal
  tested), this species was considered to be of secondary importance becaus=
e
  field infection rates were low (0.03 females per 1000) and few females be=
came
  infected and transmitted SLE virus in laboratory vector competence experi=
ments.
  Although C. erythrothorax fed on humans in marsh habitat (5% of total tes=
ted),
  this species infrequently fed on birds (12%) and was refractory to SLE vi=
rus
  infection in vector competence experiments; therefore, it was not conside=
red a
  vector of SLE virus. Future SLE virus surveillance and mosquito control
  programmes should be directed toward C. tarsalis populations.

AB: A biomonitoring protocol, using blood cholinesterase (ChE) activity in

is
  described. The experimental design included analysis of blood ChE activit=

e
  reproductive cycle. The same animals were used throughout the period of
  observation and were not exposed to VhE-inhibiting organophosphate or car=

  compounds. A framework for an effective biomonitoring protocol within a
  monitoring area includes establishing individual baseline blood ChE activ=
ity
  for a sentinel group of 6 animals on the bases of blood samples collected=
 over
  a 6-month period, monthly collection of blood samples for ChE activity
  determination during monitoring, and selection of adult animals as sentin=
els.
  Exposure to ChE-inhibiting compounds would be suspected when all blood Ch=
E
  activity of all animals within the sentinel group are decreased >20% from=
 their
  own baseline value. ChE activity in sheep was found to be the least varia=
ble
  compared with data from other species. It was concluded this protocol pro=
vides
  an effective and efficient means for detecting abnormal depressions in bl=
ood
  ChE activity in livestock and can serve as a valuable indicator of the ex=
tent

  Guerrero, there is a need for detailed but inexpensive information for th=
e
  planning of health services. A cyclical process of measurement is propose=
d
  using sentinel sites, characterized as places of concentration of measure=
ment
  resources, which are not special intervention areas or health facilities.=
 The
  sites in Guerrero were selected to be representative of the health condit=
ions
  in rural and urban areas of the state. During the first two years, study =
cycles
  were carried out regarding acute respiratory infections and diarrhoea in
  infants, the risk factors associated with these afflictions and the atten=
tion
  paid to them within the community. Later cycles focussed on the importanc=
e of
  scorpion stings and Chagas' disease, the impact of measles vaccination an=
d the
  prevalence of tuberculosis. Three types of community-based data are consi=
dered
  in each cycle (impact, coverage and costs) to optimize their use in plann=
ing
  which, in summary formats, facilitate rapid analysis and presentation.

AB: The fact that A. aegypti breeding sites in Martinique are overwhelmingl=
y man
  -made, while previous attempts at species eradication by insecticides had
  failed, provoked the authorities to switch to a strategy of control by
  community participation. This called for intensive, ongoing health educat=
ion
  based on the findings of long-term entomological surveillance. A modified
  Breteau Index has been adopted which not only requires enumeration of pos=
itive
  breeding sites per 100 houses but also takes into account the nature of t=
hose
  sites. Thus, the most numerous sites were found to be pots of flowers, in=
doors,
  but potentially most productive for A. aegypti were water barrels and dis=
carded
  tyres outdoors. Together with ongoing surveillance of dengue virus transm=
ission
  by means of a serological sentinel system, these and other findings shoul=
d, it
  is hoped, provide an effective economical and long-lasting foundation for=
 A.
  aegypti control, without under-estimating the difficulties of intensive,
  permanent health education campaigns.

  clarify the epizootiology of orbivirus infections in resident livestock a=

  wild California mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus californicus). Adult Heref=

  cattle serologically positive to bluetongue virus (BTV) were housed in cl=

  proximity to seronegative goats, sheep, dairy bull calves and deer. All a=
nimals
  were monitored serologically and virologically for BTV and epizootic
  haemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) over a 6-month period (April-October 19=
81).
  Culicoides variipennis, the vector of these viruses, was trapped througho=
ut
  this period. Free-ranging deer were also surveyed for BTV and EHDV. All
  previously seronegative animals seroconverted to BTV. BTV serotype 11 was
  isolated from captive deer, BTV-10 from free-ranging deer, BTV-17 and 11 =
from
  livestock and BTV-17, 11 and 13 from C. variipennis. It appears that BTV
  transmission in deer at the Tejon Ranch occurred most often at lower elev=
ations
  and was dependent on microhabitats favouring Culicoides.=20

 The

  longevity and fecundity was not affected by aerial release. Based on moni=
toring
  with deposit cards at 10 m above ground, the helicopter had an effective =
swath
  width of 10 m. Aerial release provided an uneven distribution of deposit =
on 1.0
  -ha plots, with significantly less host eggs reaching the outer edges of =
each
  plot than in the centre. Parasitism of sentinel egg masses within the plo=
ts
  corresponded to the distribution of deposit. Over 50% of the released mat=
erial
  was deposited on the ground. Drift outside the plots was generally less t=
han 25
  m, never exceeding 100 m. The extent of drift was dependent on the applic=
ation
  technique and wind direction. Deposit cards provided an extensive rather =
than

AB: The ability of Trichogramma minutum to suppress outbreak populations of=
 the
  tortricid Choristoneura fumiferana was studied in Ontario during 1982-86.=
 The
  timing of parasitoid releases was linked to emergence and oviposition by =
the
  pest. These phenological relationships were predicted from a regression b=
ased
  on larval development at least 2 weeks before expected emergence, allowin=
g
  sufficient time to regulate parasitoid emergence during mass rearing. Eme=
rgence
  of caged adults of C. fumiferana was used to monitor moth eclosion in the
  field. Pheromone traps provided daily information on the activity of male=
s and
  helped to synchronize parasitoid releases with oviposition. Information o=
n
  parasitoid activity was obtained from sentinel (laboratory-reared) and
  naturally occurring tortricid egg masses. A curvilinear relationship betw=
een
  the rate of parasitoid release and parasitism of sentinel egg masses was
  developed. Two parasitoid releases, 1 week apart, early in the pest ovipo=
sition
  period, increased parasitism of host eggs by 14-83%, reducing larval
  populations by 42-82%. Single releases were less effective, increasing
  parasitism by 0.3-52%. Two parasitoid releases, combined with a spring
  application of Bacillus thuringiensis to larval populations, resulted in =
83%
  egg parasitism and 93% reduction of larval populations. Release rates gre=
ater
  than 12-16 X106 female parasitoids/ha were not viable on the basis of imp=
act
  and costs.

AB: The seasonal incidence of bluetongue virus (BTV) in Central Sudan is re=
lated
  primarily to fluctuations in the prevalance of the vector, Culicoides imi=
cola.
  Population densities of this midge begin to rise with the onset of
  precipitation and peak during October, before falling sharply at the end =
of the
  rainy season in November. These are also the months of BTV transmission.
  Populations of C. schultzei, the commonest midge in Central Sudan, are al=
so
  related to the rainy season but this species does not seem to be involved=
 with
  BTV transmission. BTV serotype 2 was isolated from C. imicola, confirming=
 the
  status of this midge as a known vector but a second isolate of the same
  serotype was made from a mixed pool of Culicoides not including C. imicol=
a.
  This suggests that BTV transmission in the Sudan may involve more than on=
e
  species of Culicoides. Epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) seroty=
pe 4
  and a palyam virus were isolated from C. schultzei which indicates that t=
his
  species may be involved in the transmission of BT-related viruses. Seven
  further virus isolates from sentinel calves at Shambat (Khartoum) confirm=
ed the
  presence of BTV serotypes 1, 4 and 16, and an untyped EHDV (designated 31=
8) in
  the Sudan. All of the viruses isolated and identified during the course o=
f this
  work are recorded from the Sudan for the first time.

AB: In a study of 118 SPF male Wistar rats (Cr1:(WI)BR), the animals were
  inoculated intranasally with approximately 103 median mouse lethal infect=
ive
  doses of sialodacryoadenitis (SDA) virus. Animals were subsequently selec=
ted
  (45) at random, removed to a separate isolation room, and reinfected with=
 SDA
  virus at 3, 6, 9, 12 or 15 months. Pre- and postinoculation serum samples=
 were
  collected from all animals during the course of the study and evaluated f=
or
  antibody titres to SDA virus. All experimental, control and sentinel anim=
als
  were killed and examined for lesions consistent with SDA. Salivary gland
  lesions were minimal to absent in rats reinfected with SDA virus for up t=
o 12
  to 15 months after the intitial exposure and minimal to moderate in the
  respiratory tract at 12 or 15 months. SDA-associated lesions were extensi=
ve in
  age-matched control animals examined at each time period of reinfection w=
ith
  SDA virus. It is concluded that exposure to SDA virus did protect against=
 the
  development of typical salivary gland lesions for up to 15 months. Recove=
red
  animals were evaluated for their ability to transmit the virus following
  reinfection. Rats reinfected at 6 to 9 months were infectious to their na=
ive
  cage mates. It is also concluded that reinfection with homologous rat
  coronavirus can occur as early as 6 months after the initial infection, a=
nd
  such rats can transmit the infection to contact controls.

AB: Experiments were conducted to determine (a) whether BALB/c mice housed =
on
  soiled bedding can be used as sentinels for the detection of Sendai virus=
 and
  MHV from infected mice housed in microisolators, and (b) whether the
  microisolator caging system protects mice against Sendai virus and MHV
  infections. Sentinel mice were housed in microisolator cages, exposed
  continuously to soiled bedding and bled at 21 and 42 days for serology. A=
ll
  sentinel mice were seropositive for MHV by 42 days; however, sentinel mic=
e
  exposed to soiled bedding were seronegative for Sendai virus at 21 and 42=
 days.
  It is suggested that sentinels housed on soiled bedding may not detect al=
l
  infectious murine viruses. It is concluded that the microisolator caging =
system
  provided an effective barrier against MHV infection at the cage level and
  suggests that the microisolators should protect mice against other infect=
ious
  agents.

AB: Twenty isolates of Jamestown Canyon (JC) virus were obtained from adult
  females of 5 Aedes species (A. provocans, A. intrudens, A. canadensis, A.
  aurifer and A. abserratus/punctor) collected at the Houghton Lake Wildlif=
e
  Research Area, Missaukee County, in north-central Michigan, between 1985 =
and
  1989. Fourteen were from A. provocans, and 6 were from 4 other snowmelt A=
edes
  species. One isolate of trivittatus virus (from A. excrucians) and one Ca=
che
  Valley-like virus (from A. fitchii) were also obtained. Seasonal successi=
on
  patterns for numerous mosquito species (e.g. the Aedes species mentioned =
above,
  A. vexans, A. cinereus, Anopheles punctipennis, Coquillettidia perturbans=
 and
  Culex pipiens/restuans) were recorded over 4 years. The temporal associat=
ion of
  adult mosquito emergence, virus isolations, and infection and seroconvers=
ion of
  sentinel deer (Odocoileus virginianus) suggest that Aedes provocans is a
  primary enzootic vector of JC virus in that focus. A. provocans provides =
an
  overwintering reservoir for JC virus at the study site. A large dry ice-b=
aited
  "tent-trap" was the most productive method for collecting numerous aedine=
 and
  other mosquito species (15 species collected, as compared to 14 with CDC =
light

  exotic wild and domestic sheep. P. multocida was isolated from nasal swab=
s
  collected from 4 of 6 carrier sheep, but not from bighorn sheep prior to
  exposure. Pre-exposure vaccination and alpha-interferon treatments were n=
ot
  successful at preventing pneumonia. Pneumonia was diagnosed in all bighor=
n
  sheep within 30 days of exposure to carrier sheep. Carrier sheep did not =
have
  signs of pneumonia during the study period. All bighorn sheep eventually =
died
  from bronchopneumonia, despite antimicrobial treatment. P. multocida was
  isolated from lung tissue in 4 of 5 bighorn sheep at PM. Viral agents wer=
e not
  determined to have a role in the development of pneumonia in the bighorn =
sheep.
  Results of the study verified that exposure to exotic wild and domestic s=
heep
  could compromise the health of bighorn sheep, and that bighorn sheep are
  particularly susceptible to P. multocida pneumonia. It was thought that t=
he
  development of chronic sinusitis in the cornual sinuses may be responsibl=
e for
  the recurrence of pneumonia following antimicrobial treatment.

kabane
  isolate came from Culicoides imicola. This is the first isolation of an A=
kabane
  virus from Culicoides in Arabia. Vector competence studies with the Oman

  of sentinel chickens during late summer in both years and SLE virus was n=
ot
  isolated from mosquitoes. Initial results indicated that WEE and perhaps =
SLE

  common in November-May and Culex spp. in June-October. The occurrence of =
Culex
  spp. was bimodal. In 1987, St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus was isolate=

  C. tarsalis and anti-SLE antibodies were detected in sentinel chickens in=
 the
  Sepulveda basin. In July 1986 a single human case of SLE occurred in Norw=
alk,
  on the San Gabriel River: CDC light trapping of the river yielded enough =
C.
  tarsalis to form 47 pools, of which 17 were positive for SLE virus infect=

  In 1987, however, the river remained dry, and CDC and New Jersey light tr=

AB: Bivens Arm virus (BAV) is a newly discovered rhabdovirus infecting catt=
le
  and water buffalo in Florida. The virus is classified as a member of
  Tibrogargan group, members of which have hitherto been found only in
  Australasia. They are considered to be transmitted by Culicoides species.
  Bivens Arm virus was first isolated from Culicoides insignis which sugges=
ts
  that BAV is also transmitted by this genus. A serological survey of two s=
mall
  groups of cattle raised in St. Croix and Puerto Rico, in the Caribbean,
  established that antibody to BAV, or a closely related virus, exists on b=
oth
  islands. A retrospective analysis of seroconversions to BAV in sentinel c=
alves
  in Florida, relative to populations of potential Culicoides vectors, fail=
ed to
  demonstrate any statistically significant correlation.

AB: The persistence of arboviruses was studied in 1983-88 in mixed agricult=
ure,
  marsh, riparian and foothill habitats in Kern County, California. Western
  equine encephalomyelitis (WEE) virus was isolated frequently during 1983 =
from
  Culex tarsalis and Aedes melanimon and was detected by the seroconversion=
 of
  sentinel chickens. WEE virus then disappeared, even though vector compete=
nce
  studies during 1984-86 showed that C. tarsalis was able to transmit WEE v=
irus.
  St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus was detected sporadically in 3 of the =
6
  years of the study by isolation from C. tarsalis and/or by sentinel chick=
en
  seroconversion. When mosquito pools were screened for virus in suckling m=
ice,
  Turlock (TUR) and Hart Park (HP) viruses were isolated from C. tarsalis d=
uring
  each summer. Vertical transmission of HP was indicated by the isolation o=
f
  virus from a pool of male C. tarsalis. California encephalitis (CE) virus=
 was
  isolated repeatedly from host-seeking A. melanimon females, males, and ad=
ults
  reared from field-collected immatures, verifying vertical transmission in
  nature. Horizontal transmission of CE virus among both jackrabbits (Lepus
  californicus) and desert cottontails (Sylvilagus auduboni) appeared to am=
plify
  A. melanimon infection rates during the summer of 1985, but elevated herd
  immunity depressed infection rates during 1986. Thus, CE, HP and TUR viru=
ses
  persisted in Kern County, while WEE virus appeared to become extinct and
  required reintroduction. The sporadic occurrence of SLE virus activity re=
mains
  unexplained, but its persistence may require both vertical transmission a=
nd
  reintroduction.

  only 1 probable human infection was detected in that state, in a febrile,
  comatose child in Plymouth County, who showed rising EEE antibody levels
  commencing 16 August. In New York, EEE isolations were made from Culiseta
  morsitans, C. melanura or Aedes canadensis from 23 July onwards; sera fro=
m
  birds and horses also indicated EEE virus activity in the state, and vect=
or
  control followed. In New Jersey, EEE virus isolations from A. sollicitans=
 since
  July in all monitoring sites have indicated epidemic risk but there have =
been
  only presumptive equine and no human cases. Equine cases occurred in Geor=
gia as
  early as April, and later from Maryland and North and South Carolina. In =
South
  Carolina 1 fatal human EEE case showed onset on 1 June, and a presumptive=
 case
  in North Carolina on 1 August.

  epidemiology of bluetongue and related orbiviruses in Oman, from March 19=
87
  -February 1988. The results indicate that bluetongue virus (BTV) is wides=
pread
  and is enzootic in Northern Oman. At least 3 BTV serotypes (3, 4 and 22) =
were
  present at the time of the study. Antibodies to epizootic haemorrhagic di=
sease
  of deer virus (EHDV) type 2 and EHDV-318 were also detected but were less
  prevalent. Entomological investigations identified the presence of 16 spe=
cies
  of Culicoides (out of 9128 individuals collected); light traps were opera=
ted 2
  nights each week from March 1987 to June 1988. The peak seasonal incidenc=
e of
  the BTV vector C. imicola and the EHDV vectors C. schultzei (group) midge=
s at
  Rumais in Northern Oman correlated closely with the spring rains in that =
area.
  However, both species of midge were also present in lower numbers through=
out
  the year. These 4 species (i.e. C. imicola, and C. oxystoma, C. kingi and=
 C.
  neoschultzei in the C. schultzei group) comprised 90.8% of the total catc=
h.
  Four species of Omani midge, C. arabiensis, C. ibriensis, C. neoschultzei=
 and

  that transmission occurred in late spring. Fluke burdens ranged from one =
to 302
  in ewes and from one to 345 in lambs. Infections with 200 or more flukes =
were
  always fatal. A unique feature of this study was the annual cyclical
  fluctuation of the fluke burdens. Burdens reached maximum levels during t=
he
  winter and then declined to low numbers by late spring and summer. This
  suggested self-regulation which may be dependent on breed resistance or m=
ay be
  related to forage factors, including lack of forage (nutritional stress).=
 Snail
  populations were cyclical and correlated with fluke transmission as obser=
ved in
  the sentinel sheep. The weather was observed to affect the snail populati=

  which in turn limited fluke transmission.

AB: The feasibility of the sterile insect method (SIRM) was tested against
  natural populations of C. bezziana in the Mussa Valley, Papua New Guinea.
  Sterile mating frequencies were determined from egg masses laid by native
  females on wounded sentinel cattle. The aerial release of sterilized pupa=
ria
  resulted in low frequencies of sterile matings and few trap recaptures of
  released material. The release of chilled adult flies resulted in higher
  frequencies of sterile matings and many trap recaptures. The mean density=
 of
  males released was 230 males per km2 per week over a target area of 361 k=
m2
  (48% of the valley). Sterile masses were first detected 2 weeks after the
  release of chilled flies commenced, reaching a weekly peak of 33% after 5=
 weeks
  of releases, with 15% of egg masses found to be sterile during the final =
month.
  The levels of sterile matings achieved in this trial were similar to comp=
arable
  SIRM studies made in the USA, Mexico and Guatemala to control Cochliomyia
  hominivorax.=20

of the
  predominant predator, Geocoris punctipes, amid cover crops, on or near
  cantaloupe plants, and on or near sentinel egg masses of Spodoptera frugi=
perda
  pinned to cantaloupe leaves. No significant difference was found for
  proportions of egg masses occupied or damaged by predators. For all indic=
es of
  predator abundance and efficiency, absolute responses were highest for th=
e
  plots of subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum 'Mt. Barker'). Numbe=
rs of
  G. punctipes per sentinel egg mass were signifciantly greater for the
  subterranean clover regime than for rye, crimson clover, and a polycultur=
e of 6
  cover crops, but were not significantly greater than for 'Vantage' vetch =
or the
  weedy fallow control plots. Rye showed particularly low densities of G.
  punctipes. Cover crops had no apparent effect on densities of aphids or
  aleyrodids on cantaloupe leaves.

  [Aujeszky] virus (RD-PRV) and 2 sentinel control animals. In groups A and=

  respectively. In groups C and D, the inoculated animals received 106 and =
103
  PFU, respectively, of RD-PRV intranasally. The RD-PRV was not isolated fr=
om
  tonsillar scrapings from any of the 16 inoculated pigs 3 days postinocula=
tion
  (PI), nor from any of the sentinel animals 7 and 14 days PI. Sera were
  evaluated 14, 21 and 56 days PI, using 4 PRV serodiagnostic procedures: a
  microtitration serum neutralization (SN) at 1:4, latex agglutination at 1=
:4 and
  confirmed at 1:40, conventional PRV ELISA at 1:20, and a commercial gX-sp=
ecific
  ELISA at 1:2. All inoculated pigs in groups A and B developed positive la=
tex
  and/or SN and or conventional ELISA responses by 14 days PI. The number o=
f
  latex- and SN-positive pigs decreased by 21 and 56 days PI. In both group=
s,
  although there were individual exceptions, ELISA reactivity developed som=
ewhat
  later and persisted longer in the majority of inoculated animals. Two of =
the 4
  inoculated pigs in group in C had similar profiles; the other 2 were only
  minimally reactive. All group D animals and all sentinel control pigs fro=
m all
  4 groups remained seronegative to the entire battery of tests. Most
  significantly, all 24 pigs remained seronegative throughout the 56-day
  experiment when using gX-specific ELISA. This study confirmed the theoret=
ical
  prediction that exposure of pigs to the thymidine kinase -positive RD-PRV=

AB: Sentinel lambs were used to identify young E. granulosus infections in
  sheep, to provide an early indication of the progress of the South Powys
  Hydatidosis Control Scheme. Four sentinel lambs were purchased on each of=
 60
  farms, from inside and outside the control area; they were examined when
  approximately 6, 10 and 15 months of age. Gross examination, thin slicing=
 of
  organs and histological examination of the lesions in the viscera detecte=
d no
  E. granulosus hydatid cysts in lambs born within the control area, wherea=
s 25%
  of the 15-month-old lambs from outside the area harboured E. granulosus c=
ysts
  (less than 1 to 2 mm in diameter). Lambs from E. granulosus infected farm=
s had
  significantly higher anti-E. granulosus ELISA antibody titres than lambs =
from
  uninfected farms. It was concluded that within one year of beginning to t=
reat
  dogs with praziquantel every 6 weeks, the transmission of E. granulosus t=
o
  sheep had ceased. In contrast, this treatment did not prevent infections =
with
  Taenia hydatigena or T. ovis; an examination of the 240 lambs detected T.
  hydatigena in 33.3%, T. ovis in 4.2% Dictyocaulus filaria in 12.1% and
  Muellerius capillaris in 49.2%.

AB: Sentinel Swiss (CD-1) mice, housed without filter bonnets, were seroneg=

  for mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) for 8 consecutive months in an experiment=
al
  colony of CD-1 mice. MHV titres had been detected sporadically in sentine=

  housed in this colony during a 2-year period. In an effort to determine w=
hether
  MHV was still present in the colony, 2 methods of exposing sentinel mice =
to an
  animal room environment were compared under routine husbandry practices. =
Eight
  cages (12 mice per cage; 2 cages per rack) of experimental virus antibody=
-free
  sentinel mice, housed without filter bonnets, were placed on the bottom s=
helf
  of 4 of 12 racks in the room. Twice each week, 4 cages of sentinel mice
  received a composite sample of dirty bedding (bedding use previously by m=
ice in
  the room). The remaining 4 cages of experimental sentinels received fresh=
 non
  -used bedding. Sentinel mice were bled at monthly intervals for MHV serol=
ogy.
  After 4 months, mice from 2 cages which received dirty bedding seroconver=
ted to
  MHV and mice from one cage were positive for Myobia musculi mites. Three =
weeks
  later, all 4 cages of mice which received dirty bedding were positive for=
 MHV
  and 3 were positive for mites. In contrast, only 2 of 4 cages of mice whi=
ch
  received fresh bedding were positive for MHV and all were negative for mi=
tes.
  These findings indicate the importance of exposing sentinel mice to dirty
  bedding and that MHV and mites may go undetected for several months in a =
mouse
  colony when the incidence levels are low where standard sanitation proced=

h
  Statistics. Data analysis was conducted by computer using the SAS statist=
ical
  package. Of the 1428 case files indicating pesticide as the primary subst=
ance
  of exposure to Minnesota residents, a mean age of 5 years (range, 1 month=
 to 85
  years) was identified; 50% of all cases were below age 3 years. Males acc=
ounted
  for 1.3 times as many cases as females. Insecticide was identified in the
  largest percentage of case files (74%), followed by herbicide (12%),
  rodenticide (11%) and fungicide (non-medicinal) (3%). Ingestion was the m=
ost
  common route of exposure; 85% of all cases originated from a residence. W=
hile
  insecticides are still the most common types of pesticide call, herbicide=
 has
  surpassed insecticide in production and sales in the US. In this study,
  herbicide type exposure calls presented a much different picture than oth=
er
  pesticide types. The usefulness of poison control centers for examination=
 of
  pesticide poisoning is explored. Since reporting occurs coincidental with=
 the
  exposure and its associated symptoms, each pesticide poisoning report cou=
ld
  potentially serve as a true sentinel health event.

  Both vaccines induced low VN titres (geometric mean titre [GMT] less than=

  At 21 weeks of age the titres produced by the two vaccines were not diffe=

  but at 50 and 60 weeks of age the VN GMT of the CEO-vaccinated group was
  greater than that of the TCO-vaccinated group. The VN GMTs did not drop o=
ver
  time in either group and actually rose between 21 and 60 weeks of age in =
the
  CEO group. Both vaccines protected layers against severe challenge with
  virulent ILT virus, neither being better than the other under these
  experimental conditions. Unvaccinated sentinel chickens were maintained i=
n
  contact with the vaccinated layers during three intervals between 1 day a=
nd 6
  weeks after vaccination. Sentinels used to detect lateral spread of vacci=

  to zero, it took a further year for the parasite rate and 2 years for
  seropositivity to follow suit in the sentinel animals. If only a relative
  decrease in DAT occurred it was followed by reduction in seroparasitologi=
cal
  prevalence rates. The use of a serological test by which Trypanosoma cong=
olense
  antibodies can be distinguished, such as Testryps CATT, is particularly u=
seful
  for estimating the animal transmission level. These preliminary results
  indicate that such kinds of continuous monitoring of sentinel pigs and sh=
eep
  can constitute a useful means of evaluating the efficiency of control of
  sleeping sickness vectors.

  sustained-release bolus (MSRB) in controlling gastrointestinal parasitism=
 in
  weaned calves during autumn-winter grazing in the temperate climate of Ge=
orgia,
  southern USA. Sixty-two weanling Angus heifers were used to assess treatm=

  differences. Six sentinel heifers were necropsied to assess pretrial
  gastrointestinal worm counts. The remaining 56 heifers were assigned to 4
  groups of 14 heifers each and were placed on four 4.86-ha dormant Bermuda=
 grass
  pastures (1 group/pasture) that had been no-till interseeded with cereal =
rye in
  early October. Heifers in 2 groups were given 1 MSRB in early November; t=

  other 2 groups served as nonmedicated controls. Three heifers (principals=
) from
  each of the 4 groups were necropsied on posttreatment days 57, 112 and 16=
8 (end
  of study) for total worm recovery. Eight 5-month-old tracer steers, raise=
d worm
  -free from birth, grazed the 4 pastures (2/pasture) for the first 21 days=
 of
  the study and then were kept in drylot for 21 days before being necropsie=

  nematodes found included Haemonchus placei, Ostertagia ostertagi,
  Trichostrongylus axei, Bunostomum phlebotomum, Cooperia oncophora, Cooper=

  Level of larval contamination of pastures grazed by control and MSRB-trea=
ted
  heifers were comparable, because the mean number of nematodes recovered f=
rom
  tracer steers grazing the control and MSRB pastures were 47 449 and 53 83=
5,
  respectively. At 28 days after treatment, MSRB-treated heifers had lower =
mean
  egg counts/g of faeces than did control heifers (280 vs 13). Although the
  magnitude of the differences between treated and control heifers decrease=
d as
  the study progressed, the differences were significant at each sampling d=
ate
  throughout the 168-day study. Necropsy of 6 the sentinels revealed a mean
  nematode count of 43 135. Necropsy of principal heifers revealed higher m=
ean
  worm counts in control heifers, compared with those in MSRB-treated heife=
rs on
  day 57 (35 758 vs 2113), 112 (20 740 vs 13 764), and 168 (27 252 vs 6957)=
.
  There were no differences in average daily weight gain between control an=
d MSRB
  -treated heifers (0.53 kg, respectively) over the duration of the study.
  However, MSRB significantly reduced egg counts and actual worm numbers du=

  sample but never found in the salvaged carcass sample. A comparsion of
  susceptibility to C. bushiensis infection revealed that mallards (Anas

acuta)
  and lesser scaup (Aythya affinis) had similar susceptibilities but that w=

ly
  influenced the number of parasites recovered 7 days post-infection; duckl=
ings
  were most heavily infected. Significant differences in gross pathology ca=
used
  by C. bushiensis were detected between duck species. Data obtained from
  sentinel ducks placed in the field for 24 h revealed that the transmissio=

  potentially lethal infections can be acquired in 24 h. Evidence is also

  On 3 other farms (IPM 2), 10-15 white plywood pyramid traps and bases tre=

  with tralomethrin insecticide at a rate of 0.15 g/m2 were placed around t=
he
  farms, electrocutor light traps were placed in some inside areas, and
  pyrethrins were used as a space spray. Three untreated farms served as
  controls. Parasitoid activity on the farms was monitored using sentinel p=
upae;
  house fly and stable fly populations were monitored with survey bait trap=
s and
  sticky paper traps resp. Total pupal parasitism on IPM 1 farms was 15.0%,
  compared with 4.3 and 3.9% on IPM 2 and control farms resp. M. raptor was
  predominant on all farms. House fly populations, but not stable fly
  populations, were significantly lowered on the IPM 1 farms; on IPM 2 farm=
s,
  stable fly populations, but not house fly populations, were significantly
  lowered. This study suggests that house and stable fly populations on dai=

AB: Nasonia vitripennis, Muscidifurax raptor, Pachycrepoideus vindemmiae,
  Spalangia sp. and Apanteles carpatus were recovered from sentinel housefl=
y
  (Musca domestica) pupae exposed in controlled-environment, caged-layer po=
ultry
  facilities during a 17-month New York statewide survey. Overall, rates of
  parasitism were low, ranging from 0.2% in early spring to 14.0% in the au=
tumn.
  The number of fly pupae attacked by N. vitripennis was significantly high=
er
  than those killed by the other parasitoid species. Of all parasitized pup=
ae
  collected in 1981, 76.9% were killed by N. vitripennis. In 1982, N. vitri=
pennis
  was responsible for killing nearly 94.8% of all parasitized pupae. N.
  vitripennis was also the most abundant parasitoid, accounting for 95.5 an=
d
  99.2% of all parasitoids emerging from sentinel pupae during 1981 and 198=
2,
  respectively. In addition, N. vitripennis was the only parasitoid species
  observed to actively parasitize fly pupae in these facilities during cold
  winter months when temperatures in the first-floor manure pits ranged fro=
m 12
  to 16=B0C. All the other parasitoid species generally were active only du=

AB: In 1986, 1987 and 1988, from June to November of each year, 108, 125, a=
nd 60
  sentinel cattle, respectively, were located in various parts of Hiroshima
  Prefecture, Japan, and utilized to isolate arboviruses, such as bovine
  ephemeral fever virus and Chuzan virus. Four strains of a virus, one in 1=
986,
  two in 1987 and one in 1988, were isolated in HmLu-1 cell culture (derive=
d from
  baby hamster lung) from blood samples from cattle which showed slight fev=
er and
  leukopenia. All the isolates were sensitive to ether, chloroform and
  deoxycholate, labile at pH 3.0 but stable at pH 7.4 and 8.0. They passed
  readily through membrane filters of 450 and 200 nm, pore size, passed thr=
ough
  100 nm filters with some titre loss, but did not pass through 50 nm filte=
rs.
  Replication of the isolate was not inhibited by 5-iodo-2-deoxyuridine. Bu=
llet
  -shaped virus particles were observed in preparations of the isolate by
  electron microscopy. The isolates were serologically indistinguishable fr=
om one
  another and showed cross reactions with Fukuoka virus, a member of the fa=
mily
  Rhabdoviridae, which had been isolated previously from biting midges and
  mosquitoes in Japan. All these findings support the identification of the
  isolates as Fukuoka virus. Neutralizing antibody to the virus was observe=
d in
  five of the 14 sentinel cattle herds, showing positive rates of 16.7-69.2=
%, in
  June 1987, and in 10 of the herds, showing positive rates of 9.1-76.9%, i=
n
  November 1987; neutralizing antibody to the virus in bovine serum samples
  collected in various parts of Hiroshima Prefecture, in 1983 and 1987 indi=
cated
  positive rates of 8.4 and 28.9%, respectively. The aetiological significa=
nce of
  the virus in bovine disease remains to be investigated.

AB: A study was conducted to examine the usefulness of a glycoprotein I (gI=
)
  -ELISA to monitor Aujeszky's virus infection in two vaccinated pig herds;=
 the
  gI-ELISA can differentiate between pigs infected with Aujeszky's disease =
virus
  and pigs vaccinated against Anjeszky"s disease with gI-negative vaccines.=
 The
  two herds had been vaccinated with gI-negative vaccines for several years=
. The
  first survey, in September 1986, revealed that approximately 10% of the
  breeding pigs in a large multiplier herd were seropositive for antibodies=
 to gI
  of Aujeszky's disease virus, and it was decided to try to eliminate the v=
irus
  from the herd by gI-ELISA testing and culling of gI-seropositive pigs. A =
one
  month quarantine period for incoming stock was established, and only gI
  -seronegative pigs were admitted to the herd. After two rounds of testing=
 and
  culling the herd appeared to be free of wild-type Aujeszky's disease viru=
s, and
  neither Aujeszky's disease virus nor antibodies could be detected either =
in 21
  sentinel pigs placed on the farm or in 347 stillborn piglets or piglets t=
hat
  died shortly after birth. The herd probably remained free of Aujeszky's d=
isease
  virus until the end of the 27-month period of monitoring except for two o=
f 639
  breeding pigs that were unexpectedly found to be positive in the gI-ELISA=
 in
  November 1987. These sows were culled. A second breeding herd was monitor=
ed for
  antibodies to gI of Aujeszky's disease virus for two years. The gI-seropo=
sitive
  sows constituted approximately 30% of the herd's breeding pigs, but they =
were
  not culled. Only two sows reared on the farm became infected in two years=
.
  Eight purchased gilts were found to be gI-seropositive after their admitt=
ance
  to the herd. Nevertheless, there was a decrease in gI-seropositive pigs d=
uring
  the monitoring period owing to the normal turnover of gI-seropositive bre=
eding
  pigs. The initial presence ot gI-seropositive sows thus did not lead to t=
he
  widespread transmission of Aujeszky's disease virus to uninfected sows, a=
nd it
  seems that it is not always necessary to remove infected pigs immediately=
 in
  order to free a herd of Aujeszky's disease virus. The antibody titres to =
gI in
  the pigs in this herd persisted at a stable level for one to two years.

  hominivorax were studied (using sentinel sheep) in tropical habitats in M=

ing
  habitat types, open pasture and dense forest, situated such that movement=
s
  within and between habitats could be measured. Flies were abundant at bot=
h
  study areas, and about one third of marked flies were recaptured at least=
 once.
  For original captures and subsequent recaptures, there was a clear prefer=
ence
  for forest habitats. Dispersal behaviour of flies was significantly relat=
ed to
  habitat type; flies in open habitats tended to disperse greater distances=
 than
  those within forested habitats. There was a net movement of flies from pa=
sture
  into forest habitats. These data indicate that surveys or studies should
  consider forested habitats as preferred sampling locations.

AB: The utility of recombinant DNA probes in the detection of natural
  trypanosome infection of tsetse flies was assessed in Lambwe Valley, near=
 the
  shores of Lake Victoria, Kenya. The tsetse flies were surveyed during 2
  different seasons in 1988. Three different probes used each contained hig=
hly
  repetitive DNA sequences specific for a species or subspecies of trypanos=
omes
  of the Nanomonas subgenus. A 4th probe contained repetitive sequences com=
mon to
  trypanosome species of the Trypanozoon subgenus. Mixed mature or immature
  infections were detected in a variety of combinations in different indivi=
dual
  tsetse flies. Such infections were detected in both the guts and mouthpar=
ts of
  some tsetse flies. Simultaneous natural infection of tsetse with the sava=
nnah
  type Trypanosoma congolense and Kilifi type T. congolense, T. congolense =
and T.
  brucei or T. congolense and T. simiae were demonstrated. The probes were =
thus
  used to demonstrate the presence in Lambwe Valley of a type of T. congole=
nse
  first observed among trypanosome isolates obtained from sentinel cattle e=
xposed
  to natural infection on a ranch at Kilifi on the Kenya coast. This type o=
f T.
  congolense appears not to be confined to the coastal region nor to any
  particular species of tsetse flies and may contribute significantly to
  livestock morbidity in other areas of eastern Africa. In the Kilifi area,=
 T.
  congolense was found primarily in Glossina austeni; in Lambwe Valley, it =
was
  found in G. pallidipes.=20

to
  visit wounds of warm-blooded animals (sheep) to feed and oviposit, with f=
eeding
  visits occurring twice as often as oviposition visits. Feeding visits ave=
raged
  5.4 min and oviposition visits averaged 15.4 min, but both types of visit=
 may
  last up to 1 h. Females of C. hominivorax are iteroparous, with ovipositi=
on
  occurring in a 3-day cycle. One female fly was recorded to live 33 days a=
nd
  oviposited at least 8 times. Oviposition activity by the population follo=
wed a
  17- to 19-day cycle, which probably corresponds to the life cycle of the =
fly.
  Clutch size was variable from 28-492 eggs, with a mean of 200 eggs per cl=
utch.
  Females deposit their clutch in 1-4 masses of eggs, usually on the margin=
 of a
  wound. If a wound is preoccupied by an egg mass, an ovipositing female pl=
aces
  her egg mass on top of or in direct contact with the previous egg mass mo=
st
  (67%) of the time. Thus, the presumption of 1 egg mass equalling the
  reproductive output of a single female is invalid. Female flies combine
  longevity and iteroparity with autogeny and large clutches. This reproduc=
tive
  behaviour is well adapted for exploitation of a transitory resource such =
as
  wounds on living animals.

even
  when JE virus activity among sentinel pigs was revealed by seroconversion=
. At
  another farm in the south, no individuals of this species were found amon=
g 987
  mosquitoes collected at the time of the outbreaks of abortion. C. pipiens
  pallens, Anopheles spp., Aedes vexans nipponii and A. japonicus were more
  abundant than C. tritaeniorhynchus and Tripteroides bambusa. C.
  tritaeniorhynchus, almost the only vector of JE virus in the southern par=
t of
  Japan, is probably not a vector of the virus in Hokkaido. The collected
  mosquitoes (2332 from 1985 and 1403 from 1986) were processed for virus
  isolation but no JE virus was isolated.

AB: In trials in 1988, whole herd immunization of a 250-sow herd located in
  southwest Minnesota was carried out using two Ambico transmissible
  gastroenteritis (TGE) vaccines. There had been periodic outbreaks of TGE =
among
  preweaning sow litters (19%) and gilt litters (80%), diarrhoea among
  postweaning pigs (estimated 22%), a low weaning rate (89%) and significan=
t
  death loss (11%). Sows, boars and unweaned piglets were given Prosystem 1=
, an
  oral TGE vaccine and, where appropriate, Prosystem 2*1*4*3, a combination
  vaccine for i.m. use, containing attenuated rotavirus and TGE virus,
  reconstituted with a combination bacterin. For the 237 litters studied du=
ring
  the 6 month trial, the incidence of preweaning scours was 3.9% (an 80%
  reduction), death loss was just 0.9% (92% reduction) and 99% of the pigs =
were
  weaned. Postweaning scours incidence was 4.5% (a reduction of 80%) and de=
ath
  loss was 0.7% which the owners indicated was a dramatic reduction. In ord=
er to
  test whether TGE had been eliminated from the herd, 20 TGE seronegative
  sentinel pigs approximately 3 to 4 weeks of age, were introduced at the e=
nd of
  the trial, and tested for 4 months. These pigs were negative for TGE-viru=
s
  antibodies (titre <2), confirming that TGE had been eliminated from the
  premises. This is the first report of the eradication of endemic TGE from=
 a
  herd with an oral vaccine, and it is concluded that whole herd immunizati=
on can
  be recommended as the dose is controlled, the vaccine is safe and easy to=
 use,
  and the programme is cost effective.

AB: Splenectomized cattle and mature, spleen-intact cattle were used as
  sentinels in a 4-year study to assess the seasonality of naturally transm=
itted
  anaplasmosis. Sentinels were exchanged and/or monitored monthly on 4 stud=
y
  areas of desert mountain range land in Idaho, Oregon, and Utah. Acute Ana=
plasma
  infections were diagnosed in sentinels every month of the year. Of 44 tot=
al
  infections, 29 (66%) were detected during March to August, the primary
  arthropod season. From December until February, 8 (8%) of the total 44
  Anaplasma infections were diagnosed; the winter tick, Dermacentor albipic=
tus,
  was the probable disease vector. Susceptible cattle were found to be at r=
isk
  throughout the year, and anaplasmosis should be considered as a possible
  diagnosis in cattle with anaemia during any season.

AB: Reproductive capacity and activity patterns of native males of Cochliom=
yia
  hominivorax were evaluated by release and recapture of sterile females in
  central Belize. On 6 occasions, 4000 virgin 1-day-old sterile females wer=
e
  released at a central location. A total of 382 females and 66 native fema=
les
  were recaptured on sentinel sheep at 4 locations. Ratios of virgin to mat=
ed
  recaptured females were used to calculate an estimated number of matings =
per
  release. During the 65-day period of the test, numbers of recaptured fema=
les
  and mating percentages increased, then decreased for the last release. Lo=
cation
  of sentinel animals, day after release, and individual releases were
  significant factors explaining capture rates for mated and nonmated relea=
sed
  females and captures of native females. Mating capacity for the native
  population of males over the 10-day recapture period was estimated to ran=
ge
  from 70 to 1735 matings for the dispersal area of these females. These da=
ta and
  estimates suggest that although male flies have relatively low population
  densities, they have significant excess mating capacity, and that product=
ion
  and release of competitive sterile males is important for the success of =
the
  screwworm eradication programme.

  and most serious in children under 12 months old, in rural areas, and in =
summer
  and autumn. On average children had diarrhoea for 11% of the year, and ne=
arly
  two-thirds of the diarrhoea was watery. Mothers increasingly used oral
  rehydration therapy. Most of the children were given less food during dia=
rrhoea
  and about one-third were taken off breast milk for a week or more if diar=
rhoea
  persisted.

  homologous antibodies of the IgG1, IgM, and IgA isotypes in serum. With t=

 were
  observed. The course of natural infection was studied in 10 calves that h=
ad
  been obtained from different farms, and housed together at 1 week of age.=
 They
  were separated from other cattle until the age of 10 months. Up to the ag=
e of 4
  months, all calves regularly excreted Breda virus in the faeces. Irrespec=
tive
  of the existence of IgG1 isotype maternal antibodies, all calves had earl=
y IgM
  responses in serum, but lack of IgA seroconversion. In 7 calves, antibody=
 titre
  decreased below detection whereas 3 calves had an isotype switch, resulti=
ng in
  persistent IgG1 titre. After introduction into the dairy herd at 10 month=
s of
  age, all calves had diarrhoea, and shedding of Breda virus was observed i=
n 8 of
  them. Seroconversion for all antibody isotypes was observed, indicating l=
ack of
  mucosal memory. In contrast, coronavirus infection in the presence of mat=
ernal
  antibodies led to isotype switch in all calves but one, and a memory resp=
onse
  was observed after introduction into the dairy herd.

AB: Filth fly parasites reared by commercial insectaries were released on 2
  dairies (MO, DG) in southern California to determine their effect on
  populations of houseflies (Musca domestica) and stable flies (Stomoxys
  calcitrans). Spalangia endius, Muscidifurax raptorellus and M. zaraptor w=
ere
  released on the MO dairy from 1985 to 1987 in varying quantities. Parasit=
ism by
  M. zaraptor on the MO dairy was significantly higher (P < 0.05) from the =
field
  -collected stable fly (4.4%) and housefly (12.5%) pupae, compared with a
  control dairy (0.1% stable fly; 1.3%, housefly). M. zaraptor, released fr=
om
  April to October during 1987 on the DG dairy (350 000 per month), was not
  recovered in a significantly higher proportion from either fly species re=
lative
  to the corresponding control dairy. No specimens of M. raptorellus were
  recovered from the MO dairy. Parasite treatments had no apparent effect o=

field
  -collected stable fly (16.8%, MO; 17.2%, DG) and housefly (23.3%, MO; 20.=

ield
  -collected stable fly and housefly pupae on all 4 dairies. Sentinel house=
fly
  pupae placed in fly-breeding sites on both dairies were parasitized at a
  significantly higher rate, as compared with sentinel pupae on control dai=
ries.
  The generic composition of parasites emerging from sentinel housefly pupa=
e was
  20.6% Spalangia spp. and 73.2% Muscidifurax spp., whereas in field-collec=

  housefly pupae, Spalangia spp. and Muscidifurax spp. constituted 74.3 and=
 19.5%
  of the parasites, respectively.

AB: In 1987, an outbreak of Ibaraki disease of cattle occurred in Miyazaki
  Prefecture; 76 of 993 cattle on 75 farms showed clinical signs of fever,
  profuse salivation, coughing and laryngoparalysis, and 12 of the affected
  cattle died. Ibaraki virus was isolated from 17 of 45 blood samples colle=
cted
  from affected animals. Virus neutralization tests showed that the antibod=
y
  positive ratios converted from 12.8% (33/258) at the early stage of the
  outbreak to 51.8% (169/326) at the end of the outbreak. Ibaraki virus was
  isolated from 3 of 5 sentinel cattle which had been kept on two farms in =
the
  district. These sentinel cattle excreted the virus for 1 to 2 months with=
out
  showing any clinical signs. The virus was not isolated from Culicoides ox=
ystoma
  or other species of Culicoides, suspected to be vectors of the virus, at =
any
  time during the outbreak.

  California, to determine the effect of selected pesticides on beneficial
  Pteromalidae. Weekly parasite sampling was conducted using sentinel Musca
  domestica pupae to assess changes in parasitization in relation to pestic=

  treatment. Sites were sampled weekly for 5 weeks before treatment and for=
 8-10
  weeks post-treatment. Treatments were applied twice to 6 hen houses (4 tr=
eated
  plus 2 controls) at each of 2 sites. Treatments were: (1) dimethoate (0.5=
%),
  spot-treatment to wet areas only (approximately 5-10% of manure surface);=
 (2)
  dimethoate (0.5%), entire manure surface; (3) cyromazine (0.1%), entire m=
anure
  surface; and (4) permethrin (0.05%) applied to all hens in the house for =
the
  ectoparasitic mite Ornithonyssus sylviarum. The 2 discrete pesticide
  applications during an 8-day period had no significant effect on activity=
 of
  Muscidifurax raptor, M. zaraptor, Spalangia cameroni and S. endius at eit=

AB: Serological evidence indicated that an epidemic of congenital abnormali=
ties
  in sheep was caused by Cache Valley virus (CVV), a bunyavirus indigenous =
to the
  USA. To determine the teratogenic potential of CVV in sheep, fetuses were
  infected in utero between 27 and 54 days of gestation with an isolate (CK=
-102)
  obtained in 1987 from a sentinel sheep in San Angelo, Texas. The dams of =
these
  fetuses were killed between 28 and 75 days after inoculation, and the fet=
uses
  were examined for malformations. 28 of 34 fetuses had congenital abnormal=
ities,
  including arthrogryposis, hydranencephaly, mummification, reabsorption, a=
nd
  oligohydroamnion. Virus was isolated from the allantoic fluid of 11 of 17
  fetuses killed at less than 70 days of gestation. The virus positive fetu=
ses,
  which were all negative for CVV-neutralizing antibody, had lesions rangin=
g from
  none to severe arthrogryposis and hydranencephaly. Virus was not recovere=
d from
  the allantoic fluid of fetuses after 76 days gestation when CVV-specific
  antibody could be detected in 5 of 8 fetuses examined. The 2 fetuses infe=
cted
  on days 50 and 54 of gestation appeared normal and 1 had antibody to CVV.

 by
  control cattle in trial 1 and control cattle on the pasture used by treat=

  L3 on herbage. In trial 1, tracer calves grazing the control animal pastu=
re
  from January 14 to 28 acquired 37 times as many nematodes as did those gr=

AB: The safety of this vaccine was assessed in pigs, calves and sheep. Four=
-day

  plaque forming units (PFU) developed only slight depression and fever. Th=
e
  virus was transmitted to a sentinel piglet. Six weeks after inoculation, =
the
  pigs were injected with high doses of corticosteroids in an attempt to
  reactivate the vaccine virus. The pigs did not shed Aujeszky's disease vi=
rus
  (ADV), did not develop a rise in virus neutralising antibody titres and
  sentinel pigs remained seronegative to ADV. Strain 783 was passaged in tw=
o
  series of three- to five-day old piglets, but after the third and fourth
  passages virus could no longer be recovered. Pregnant sows were inoculate=
d with
  107 PFU of virus strain 783 around day 35 or on day 85 of pregnancy, and =
their
  fetuses and piglets were assayed for ADV and antibodies against ADV. No
  evidence was found for transplacental transmission of the virus. Calves a=

  sheep were given 107 PFU of virus strain 783 intranasally or intramuscula=
rly;
  they survived and did not develop clinical signs of Aujeszky's disease. A=

AB: The filtration effect of 3 types of mesh screen used for mosquito cages=
 was
  evaluated using aerosols of water, mineral oil or chlorpyrifos. The mater=
ials
  were 2 nylon tulles (3X4 and 8X11 repeats per cm2) and corrosion-resistan=
t
  steel (7X7 repeats per cm2). Open areas of these 3 mesh materials were,
  respectively, 94, 79 and 88%. The droplet size frequency distributions of=
 the
  aerosols were altered by their passage through test screens of these mate=
rials
  fitted to standard exposure tubes from WHO test-kits. The alterations inc=
luded
  reductions in total droplet numbers and volume median diameter (VmD). The=
 nylon
  screen with fewest repeats altered droplet VmD and frequency distribution=
 the
  least, allowing the greatest number of droplets to enter the cages. The
  greatest filtration effect was produced with screens with less open area,
  giving rise to selective deposition of particular droplet sizes on the sc=
reen
  material. This could result in anomalous exposures of test mosquitoes to
  insecticide filtrate on the screen substrate, which may explain the poor
  correlation often observed between insecticide aerosol impact on wild tar=
get
  mosquito populations as compared with sentinel caged mosquitoes. The need=
 for
  standardization of materials used for construction of sentinel cages empl=
oyed
  for aerosol bioassays is emphasized.

AB: A 1-year study of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in a small focus of
  transmission was conducted in suburban Bangkok in 1985. Monthly data were
  collected on weather, vector density, sentinel pig and chick JE antibody
  seroconversions, and epidemiology as related to human JE cases. The prima=
ry
  vector species were found to be Culex gelidus and C. tritaeniorhynchus, f=
rom
  which one isolate each was obtained in March and June, respectively. Pig =
JE
  antibody seroconversion peaked in April (the hottest month), with seconda=
ry
  peaks following in July and December. Chick seroconversions were found on=
ly in
  June and July. Human cases (7) in the primary focus occurred in May-July,=
 and
  started 2 months following the finding of the first JE virus isolate in
  mosquitoes and 1 month following mass virus seroconversion in pigs. Overa=
ll,
  the attack rate in the focus (0.83/105) was >4 times that of the rest of
  Bangkok (0.19/105). Attack rates were highest in 0- to 9- and 10- to 19-y=
ear
  -old groups, respectively. Indications are that JE virus is transmitted t=
o
  humans in Bangkok in at least 10 of 12 months per year, but that cases ar=
e
  concentrated in the May-July period.

AB: A serological survey and experimental virus transmission studies were d=
one
  to assess the role of domestic animals as amplifier hosts of La Crosse (L=
ACV)
  and Jamestown Canyon (JCV) viruses. Serum from 319 cows, 88 dogs, 122 equ=
ines,
  47 swine, 10 goats and 4 cats were tested for neutralizing antibody to LA=
CV,
  JCV, trivittatus (TVTV) and snowshoe hare (SSHV) viruses. Antibody preval=
ences
  of LACV, TVTV and SSHV were <10% in all species. Antibody to JCV was dete=
cted
  in all species except cats. Prevalence ranged from 10% in goats and swine=
 to
  29% in dogs. No age-associated trends in JCV prevalence were noted. Two o=
f 6
  adult dogs, and 2 of 4 pigs inoculated with 6.3-6.5 log10 suckling mouse
  intracerebral 50% lethal doses (SMICLD50) of LACV developed viraemias of =
<1.0
  -2.9 log10 SMICLD50/ml 1-3 days after inoculation. Of 4 cows inoculated w=
ith
  LACV, 3 developed fatal infections. Viraemias were not detected in 4 cows=
, 4
  ponies, 7 cats or 6 sheep. Two cats fed LACV infected suckling mice shed =
virus
  from the oropharynx for 1 day each. All animals except 1 cow, 1 cat and 1=
 sheep
  had _4-fold rise in antibody titres. Five additional dogs fed upon by LAC=
V
  -infected Aedes triseriatus mosquitoes did not develop viraemias or antib=
ody,
  and uninfected A. triseriatus engorging on the dogs 1-5 days after feedin=
g by
  infected mosquitoes failed to become infected. Five ponies, 6 calves, 2 e=
wes, 6
  dogs and 5 piglets were inoculated with 3.6-7.3 log10 SMICLD50 of JCV. No=
ne
  developed detectable viraemias, although _4-fold rises in antibody titres
  developed in 60% of the ponies, 17% of the calves, 50% of the dogs and 1 =
of 2
  ewes. None of the pigs developed corresponding rises in antibody titres. =
It was
  concluded that juvenile and adult animals of the species tested are not
  efficient amplifier hosts of LACV or JCV, but may be useful sentinels of =
local
  virus transmission.

AB: In northern California, antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi were detecte=
d in
  58 of 73 (79%), and spirochaetaemias in 1 of 26 (4%) black-tailed jackrab=
bits
  (Lepus californicus californicus), by indirect immunofluorescence,
  respectively. Five species of ticks (Dermacentor occidentalis, D. parumap=
ertus,
  Ixodes neotomae, I. pacificus and Haemaphysalis leporispalustris) were
  collected from rabbits. Two of these species of ticks were found to conta=
in
  spirochaetes; 2 of 10 (20%) of I. neotomae and 2 of 174 (1%) of H.
  leporispalustris. A strain of B. burgdorferi was recovered from I. neotom=
ae.
  One infected female of H. leporispalustris passed spirochaetes via eggs t=
o
  about 67% of her progeny. The widespread distribution of the jackrabbit, =
its
  infestation by at least 4 ticks (D. occidentalis, D. parumapertus, I. neo=
tomae
  and I pacificus) known to be infected naturally with B. burgdorferi, and =
the
  high prevalence of spirochaetal antibody in this lagomorph suggest that i=
t
  might be useful as a sentinel for surveillance of Lyme borreliosis.
  Spirochaetes were detected in 15% of 40 Columbian black-tailed deer (Odoc=
oileus
  hemionus columbianus) by direct immunofluorescence bound with a Borrelia
  -specific monoclonal antibody (H9724), but not with a monoclonal antibody
  (H5332) specific for B. burgdorferi. The geographical overlap of differen=
t
  borreliae in ticks that bite wildlife such as deer confound spirochaetal
  serosurveys, and underscores the need for more specific serologic tests t=
han
  those currently available.

  naturally-acquired disease. Horizontal transmission from cats inoculated =
by
  skin scarification, caused only subclinical infection in sentinel cats.
  Oronasal inoculation resulted in transient coryza and milder generalized

AB: Two State-wide surveys of sentinel herds were carried out in 1978 to de=
tect
  bluetongue (BLU) virus antibody in cattle and sheep serum samples in New =
South
  Wales (NSW). The first survey showed that BLU group antibody in cattle 18=
-24
  months old was confined to the coastal region (east of the Great Dividing
  Range) and the Hunter Valley. However, in the second survey, of cattle mo=
re
  than 5 years old, reactors were much more widely distributed over the nor=
th
  -eastern third of the State and into the western division with prevalence=
s up
  to 85% in some areas. In contrast, very few reactors were detected in she=
ep in
  either survey (less than 1% of the sheep serum samples tested). In a
  retrospective study of stored cattle serum samples, BLU group reactors we=
re
  detected in the north-east of the State in each year examined since 1968,=
 the
  earliest year in which samples were available from that region. Areas to =
the
  south and west were free of antibody from 1966 until the summer of 1973, =
but
  subsequently reactors were common. Examination of selected areas for type
  -specific antibody indicated that infection of cattle with two of the thr=
ee
  Australian BLU serotypes which were known at the time, BLU-1 and BLU-21, =
had
  occurred in NSW. No antibody to BLU-20, the original Australian isolate, =
was
  detected. A close association was observed between strong group antibody
  reactions and type-specific neutralizing activity against BLU-1 and BLU-2=
1.
  Both were largely confined to that area of the State in which a high (75%=
 or
  more) prevalence of group antibody was found in the older animals. In con=
trast,
  reactions from areas with a low prevalence of group antibody were almost =
all
  weak and rarely associated with neutralizing activity for BLU-1 or BLU-21=
. Weak
  reactions may be group cross-reactive and induced by BLU-related, rather =
than
  BLU, viruses. Three surveys of cattle for bluetongue (BLU) antibody were
  conducted over the years 1978-1980 in coastal areas of NSW. In each surve=
y the
  samples were identified by age. The prevalence of BLU-group antibody,
  demonstrated in a gel diffusion precipitin test, was highest in the north=
 and
  decreased progressively to the south. Antibody prevalence increased with =
age.
  However, according to variations in prevalence by age and region, it was
  concluded that the activity of relevant viruses was highly variable betwe=
en
  years and was geographically discontinuous. Evidence is presented that mu=
ch of
  the antibody found, especially in animals less than 4 years old, failed t=
o
  persist from one year to another. Factors likely to contribute to more
  persistent reactions in older animals are discussed. Neutralizing antibod=
ies to
  bluetongue virus serotypes 1 and 21 were demonstrated and prevalence of t=
hese
  was associated with location and age, as was that of group-specific antib=
ody.

  orbiviruses were isolated; 99 were of the Palyam group, 15 were of the
  epizootic haemorrhagic disease (EHD) of deer group, and 4 of the bluetong=

Creek,
  23 CSIRO Village, 7 D'Aguilar and one was not typed. The EHD viruses were
  identified as 13 type 5 and 2 type 6. All 4 bluetongue viruses were type =
21.
  There was also convincing serological evidence that bluetongue type 1 inf=
ection
  occurred in 1980. Antibody to the bluetongue group, as demonstrated in a =
gel
  diffusion precipitin test, was often transient. It appeared to be mostly =
cross
  -reactive with, and induced by, other orbivirus infections, particularly =
those
  of the EHD group. Viruses of the Palyam group also seemed to be implicate=
d in
  some circumstances. Where infections by viruses of the bluetongue group w=
ere
  demonstrated, the precipitating antibody responses to a bluetongue group
  antigen were not noticeably stronger than many which followed EHD virus
  infection. The results generally confirm previous conclusions, deduced fr=

AB: About 11 000 each of Muscidifurax raptor and Urolepis rufipes were rele=
ased
  weekly for 7 weeks at a commercial dairy farm in central New York state.
  Dispersal behaviour was monitored by parasitism rates of pupae of Musca
  domestica placed in sentinel bags. Muscidifurax raptor, which was release=
d
  inside the barn, parasitized fly pupae both inside and outside, and it ac=
hieved
  highest rates of parasitism in indoor straw calf-bedding and in outdoor m=
anure
  and silage. U. rufipes, which was released outside the barn, did not atta=
ck
  pupae inside the barn, and its highest rates of parasitism occurred in ou=
tdoor
  manure and silage. M. raptor appeared to be more effective than U. rufipe=
s in
  parasitizing pupae located at sites where natural fly-breeding occurred.
  Interspecific competition did not appear to explain these distribution
  patterns. There was no significant trend in parasitism by M. raptor as a
  function of distance from the release station. Furthermore, high rates of
  parasitism near open doorways and an outdoor site 30 m away suggests that=
 M.
  raptor dispersed throughout the barn and its immediate surroundings. Air
  temperature was positively correlated to flight activity, but not to
  parasitization activity in natural fly-breeding substrates.

  localities, and in 90% of jackrabbits from a single locality, in northern
  California. One of the populations of brush rabbits that did not yield
  seropositive individuals was from an oceanic island devoid of any other
  terrestrial mammal, whereas the other population was located on an isolat=
ed
  flood plain bordering San Francisco Bay. Absorption tests using B. burgdo=

d for
  17 days in a small double-fenced paddock (350 m2) within the permanent sh=
eep
  pasture and the other 3 with the ewes and lambs on the same pasture. Afte=
r 17
  days these sentinel lambs were housed for 10 days before slaughter and PM
  examination. The results showed that Ostertagia spp., Cooperia oncophora,
  Nematodirus spp., Chabertia ovina and Trichuris spp. eggs and/or larvae
  survived on pastures overwinter. Second generation Ostertagia larvae were
  present in greatest numbers on pasture during the latter part of August a=
nd
  early September. The failure of a significant build-up of Cooperia oncoph=
ora
  was attributed to negligible worm egg output of this species in sheep. A =

AB: Culex nigripalpus is a proven vector of St. Louis encephalitis virus (S=
LE)
  in southern Florida. It is an important vector for 3 reasons: its opportu=
nistic
  blood-feeding behaviour, its ability to forage and locate hosts in a vari=
ety of
  habitats, and its ability to retain eggs for long periods when suitable
  oviposition sites are unavailable. Results of laboratory and field observ=
ations
  documenting that C. nigripalpus fits the above criteria are presented. Fi=
eld
  data are also presented showing that SLE activity in sentinel birds (chic=
kens)
  as well as in humans occurs in Florida during years when heavy autumn rai=
nfalls
  are separated by periods of drought. Blood-feeding and oviposition behavi=
ours
  of C. nigripalpus are affected by rainfall. Large amounts of rainfall all=
ow
  mosquitoes to oviposit and then to enter and blood feed in habitats where=
 they
  could not previously forage because of the dry conditions. Thus, rainfall
  patterns are an important part of the SLE transmission cycle in southern
  Florida.

 mite
  in the bedroom and living room (p < 0.001) and airborne mite in the bedro=
om and
  dust from the bedroom mattress (p < 0.001). Most houses had specific epit=
opes
  of both Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p I) and D. farinae (Der f I)
  allergens, but Der f I was present in greater amounts. In 7 houses >10 =
=B5g Der p
  I and Der f I per g settled dust was found, indicating that some houses h=
ad
  concentrations of mite allergens high enough to cause allergic disease, e=
ven in
  the winter. Clinical interpretation of these data on air levels is hamper=
ed by
  uncertainty as to whether symptoms are more closely related to average st=

e
  concentration of cat allergen correlated with mite allergen in the air, b=

PY: 1987
LA: English
AB: Using two sentinel calf herds, the seasonal incidence of bluetongue in
  central Sudan was predictable and related to the rainy season and to vect=
or
  population. Seroconversions to bluetongue virus (BTV) were detected only
  between July and December. Neutralizing antibodies to 16 BTV serotypes (1=
-10,
  12, 14, 17, 20-22) were detected in both sentinel herds. A blocking enzym=
e
  -linked immunosorbent assay distinguished between infections with BTV and=
 with
  other orbiviruses. Agar gel tests on serum samples from 13 calves at Sham=
bat
  and from 17 at Um Benein indicated BTV infections not attributable to any=
 of
  the 22 serotypes, suggesting the presence of new serotypes of BTV. Sera f=
rom 30
  calves gave results indicating infection with BTV-related viruses, rather=
 than
  BTV serotypes. Comparing these results with those reported from Kenya, it=
 is
  suggested that the pattern of the disease and the types involved are simi=
lar in
  both countries and that the movements of the Intertropical Convergence Zo=
ne
  (I.T.C.Z.) may carry infected midges northwards into the Sudan at the sta=
rt of
  the rainy season and southward at the end of this period.

III).
  During 1983-85, the ecology of mosquito spiroplasmas was studied in diffe=
rent
  biotopes in the Isere River valley region of Savoia, France. Twenty-three
  strains were isolated from 4 species or groups of species of mosquitoes: =
Aedes
  sticticus/A. vexans, A. cantans/A. annulipes, A. cinereus/A. geminus and
  Coquillettidia richiardii. The spiroplasmas were isolated only from femal=
e
  mosquitoes and only in June and July. An unidentified virus was also isol=
ated
  from 3 mosquito pools, one of which yielded spiroplasmas. No spiroplasma
  viruses were detected. Antibody to the Ar 1357 isolate (serogroup XXII) w=
as
  found in 4 of 20 serum samples from cows living in the study area, but no=
t in

  Province, Argentina, an area where there was active transmission of Trypa=
nosoma
  cruzi. Spraying of walls and roofs with Neopynamin [tetramethrin] reveale=
d
  relatively few individuals of Triatoma infestans (<50 per house) in about=
 a
  quarter of the dwellings, and relatively high densities (>50 bugs) in all=
 but
  one of the rest. Less than 16 bugs were infected with Trypanosoma cruzi i=
n 6
  homes, while most of the rest yielded at least 40. Statistically signific=
ant
  differences were found between the infection rates of both children and d=
ogs in
  'low-risk' and 'high-risk' settings. Captures of <15 infected bugs per
  household are suggested to be below threshold densities for successful
  transmission of T. cruzi to children. The findings also suggested that
  relatively cheaper control measures than those currently employed might
  interrupt parasite transmission, that dogs were more likely than children
  inhabiting the same house to acquire the infection, that the presence of
  infected dogs may increase the risk of transmission to human residents, a=
nd
  that the status of infection in dogs could provide a means of assessing t=
he
  likelihood of infection in children.

AB: Humoral immune responses of sheep to natural bluetongue vurus (BTV)
  infection were studied on a temporal basis. The temporal development of v=
iral
  protein-specific IgG was determined by western immunoblotting; virus
  neutralization and agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) were conducted for
  comparative purposes. Prior to the emergence of the arthropod vector
  (Culicoides variipennis) and the associated transmission of BTV, virus
  -neutralizing antibody was absent from all sentinel sheep; 3 sheep had pr=
e
  -existing AGID antibody and all sheep had IgG, specific for 4 viral prote=
ins,
  as determined by immunoblotting. Following emergence of the BTV vector, 9=
 of 11
  sheep became infected, as determined by virus isolation, with BTV. All sh=
eep
  developed virus-neutralizing and AGID antibody. However, only those sheep=
 with
  a demonstrable viraemia showed an increase in viral protein-specific anti=
body.
  Development of viral protein-specific IgG varied with the individual anim=
al and
  no obvious correlation between a specific response and protective immunit=
y or
  viral clearance was noted. From a diagnostic viewpoint, the immunoblottin=
g
  procedure was superior in identifying past exposure to BTV, as compared w=
ith
  neutralization and AGID. In addition, the application of immunoblotting t=
o
  paired serum samples appeared to be a sensitive indicator of viraemia.

AB: An ecological study was conducted during 1983-84 to evaluate the role o=
f
  some haematophagous arthropods as possible vectors and/or reservoirs of
  Jamestown Canyon (JC) virus on the Delaware-Maryland-Virginia Peninsula.
  Arthropods were collected and assayed for virus in Vero cells by standard
  plaque technique. Sera from sentinel goats, free-ranging goats and wild
  vertebrates were assayed for JC-virus-neutralizing (N) antibody by plaque
  -reduction neutralization tests. This virus was not isolated from 158 253=
 adult
  bloodsucking insects, including 139 392 Aedes mosquitoes (e.g. A. canaden=
sis,
  A. cantator, A. sollicitans and A. taeniorhynchus) and 3572 other biting =
flies
  (Chrysops, Hybomitra, Tabanus and other Tabanidae and Stomoxys calcitrans=
), nor
  from 44 785 Aedes mosquitoes reared from larvae and 3328 ticks (Amblyomma
  americanum and Dermacentor variabilis) collected as nymphs or adults. How=
ever,
  2 isolates of Cache Valley virus were obtained from Aedes taeniorhynchus =
and A.
  sollicitans. Serological evidence indicated that JC virus was transmitted=
 to
  domestic goats during May 1983 and June 1984. Also, antibody was demonstr=
ated
  in sera obtained from Sylvilagus floridanus (4/13), Didelphis virginiana
  (4/25), Procyon lotor (11/141), and Odocoileus virginianus (34/47). The a=
bsence
  of JC virus in Aedes mosquitoes in the presence of virus transmission to
  mammals strongly implies that this virus was maintained and transmitted i=
n this
  area by arthropods other than Aedes mosquitoes.

AB: C. bushiensis has been associated with late-summer duck mortality in
  southern Quebec, Canada. In an attempt to relate these die-offs with seas=
onal
  availability of the infective metacercariae to the ducks, 2 intermediate =
host
  (Bithynia tentaculata L.) populations were regularly sampled in 1984 and =
1985.
  Prevalence varied between 5.3 and 57.3% at the South River, and between 9=
.1 and
  49.7% at Lake St. Francis over the period of the study. Maximum abundance=
s at
  the 2 localities were 1.38 and 1.66 metacercariae/snail, respectively. No=
 close
  link between availability of metacercariae and periods of duck mortality =
was
  found, as the total prevalence and abundance of the cysts decreased throu=
gh the
  summer, probably as a consequence of snail recruitment and low cercarial
  transmission rates, and increased in the autumn. Prevalence and abundance=
 of
  metacercariae increased with snail age, estimated by both size and annual
  growth lines, and the metacercariae were found to be aggregated in the sn=
ail
  population. Comparison of infection levels reached at the end of the 2 sa=
mpling
  seasons by 2 year classes of B. tentaculata suggested that transmission o=
f
  cercariae was higher in 1984 than in 1985. This was supported by the resu=
lts of
  exposure of sentinel snails in an infected area during the 2 years of the
  study: transmission was detected in 1984 but not in 1985. In addition to =
C.
  bushiensis metacercariae, the sentinel snails acquired Spaeridiotrema glo=
bulus,
  another potential duck pathogen, in both years. The peak rate of transmis=
sion
  of S. globulus metacercariae occurred in August.

  was investigated using a live vaccine. Serum samples were obtained before=
 and 3
  weeks after vaccination in March and April, about one month before the an=
imals
  were put on pasture. Additional blood samples were collected at the end o=
f the
  grazing season and again the next spring. At that time previously unvacci=
nated
  sentinel calves were vaccinated and their antibody response was tested 3 =
weeks
  later. All sera were analysed with an IF technique. All vaccinated calves=
 were
  seropositive 3 weeks after vaccination. The response did not differ
  significantly between animals vaccinated before their first or second gra=
zing
  season although the age difference was about 12 months. No clinical sympt=
oms of
  babesiosis were seen in vaccinated animals. The titres were, however,
  significantly higher 3 weeks after vaccination than 6 months later. After=
 the
  grazing season about 42% of the unvaccinated sentinel calves were seropos=
itive.
  Two of these calves had clinical babesiosis on pasture in July and Septem=
ber,
  respectively. The number of sentinel calves which became infected on past=
ure
  showed a large farm-to-farm variation although all cattle on the farms on=
ce had
  been infected/vaccinated with B. divergens. Probably the different number=
 of
  calves infected was a reflection of a variation in tick density on the
  different pastures. All calves, which were seropositive after the grazing
  season, were also seropositive after 6 months indoors. The titres decline=
d
  during the winter period, but they were still within the range of 2 doubl=
ing
  dilution steps.

AB: Perinatal lamb mortality, associated with malformations of the CNS due =
to
  Akabane viral infection, occurred in 4 of 9 flocks of ewes lambing on 3 f=
arms
  between 26 May and 14 November, 1976. Cases were restricted to ewes conce=
iving
  prior to the second week of March and lambing between 26 May and 19 July.=
 As
  judged by seroconversion in sentinel flocks on 2 of the farms, field infe=
ction
  with Akabane virus occurred mainly between mid-February and mid-April.
  Malformations of the CNS occurred in 42.5%, 51.2%, 100% and 31.0% of the =
dead
  lambs examined in the affected flocks respectively. Prevalence in the 4
  affected flocks, expressed as the proportion of ewes lambing which delive=
red at
  least one malformed fetus, was 6.1%, 8.4%, 88.9% and 5.7% respectively. L=
amb
  mortality due to malformations of the CNS was 7.1%, 5.5%, 92.3% and 5.7% =
of
  lambs born. Age-specific prevalence was calculated for 3 of the 4 flocks =
and 2
  -year-old ewes accounted for 71.4% and 76.9% of total cases respectively =
in 2
  flocks, whereas in one flock malformations occurred at equivalent frequen=
cies
  throughout several older age groups. Birthweights of affected lambs were
  usually significantly lighter than those of unaffected lambs of similar s=
ex and
  birth-type, and their mean duration of gestation was slightly, and
  significantly, prolonged. Micrencephaly (88.1% of cases) and hydrocephalu=
s
  (68.7% of cases) were the outstanding pathological features of the
  malformations with hydranencephaly, microgyria, porencephaly and attenuat=
ion of
  the spinal cord occurring at much lower frequencies. Other deformities, u=
sually
  of the musculoskeletal system, commonly accompanied these abnormalities. =
The
  mean weights of the brain and spinal cords of affected lambs were 31.3% a=
nd
  87.7% respectively of those of unaffected lambs. The epidemiological data
  provide a basis for calculating the cost-benefits of controlling the dise=
ase by
  vaccination.

AB: The dispersal of mass released adults of Muscidifurax zaraptor, a solit=

  fly breeding habitats. Under a raised feedbunk, parasitism ranged from 32=
.5 to
  63.5% when monitored by a linear arrangement of sentinel pupae of M. dome=
stica.
  Dispersal patterns were not apparent; average parasitoid emergence from
  sentinel pupae on each side of the release point were not significantly
  different. Parasitoid releases in open-piled manure generally produced lo=
wer
  parasitism levels than under the feedbunk. In open-piled manure, Muscidif=
urax
  zaraptor tended to move more in one direction (northerly) than the other.
  Sentinel pupae were parasitized as far as 8 m from the release site. Ther=
e was
  no apparent correlation between the numbers of female parasitoids release=
d and
  the levels of parasitism achieved in either habitat. Increasing the densi=
ty of
  sentinel pupae under the feedbunk significantly decreased parasitoid emer=
gence;
  however, changing the pupal density in open-piled manure had no effect on
  parasitoid emergence.

  virus neutralizing antibodies were present in sheep, goats, donkeys, came=
ls and
  cattle in Oman and in cattle, goats, sheep and equines in North Yemen. An=
alysis
  of the antibody titres showed that virus activity had occurred in both

  cattle in Oman from August 1984 to November 1986 and in North Yemen from =
May
  1983 to July 1984 also failed to show any seroconversion to Akabane virus=
,
  suggesting that the virus is not endemic in these countries. Serological
  surveys of cattle in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, South Yemen and the U=
nited
  Arab Emirates in 1983, 1984 and 1986 showed evidence of Akabane virus
  antibodies in cattle in all 5 countries. Antibodies were detected in 1-ye=
ar-old
  cattle in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain in 1986, suggesting an Akabane=
 virus
  incursion in 1985/86. The possibility of windborne infected vectors initi=

PY: 1988
LA: English
AB: Two sentinel calf herds at Shambat and Um Benein were used to study the
  epidemiology of arbovirus infections of livestock in Central Sudan. The r=
esults
  indicate that there is a distinct seasonal pattern of infection with blue=
tongue
  and related orbiviruses, which occurs annually between July and December.
  Neutralizing antibodies were detected against 16 bluetongue virus (BTV)
  serotypes (1-10, 12, 14, 17, 20-22), four epizootic haemorrhagic disease
  viruses (EHDV) and two Palyam viruses. Antibodies against Akabane virus w=
ere
  not detected in calves but were detected in older animals, suggesting tha=
t this
  virus does not occur annually. The seasonal occurrence of orbivirus infec=
tions
  was related to the prevailing climatic conditions, suggesting that infect=
ions
  are initiated by wind-borne, infected vectors from endemic areas to the s=
outh.
  Bluetongue virus 1, BTV 4, BTV 16, EHDV (318) and three distinct Palyam v=
iruses
  were isolated from the calves at Shambat. An additional Palyam virus was
  isolated from Culicoides midges collected at Shambat. Three further isola=
tes
  from Culicoides collected at Nyala in Western Sudan were identified as BT=
V 2 (2
  isolates) and EHDV Ib Ar 33853. These results implicate C. imicola as a B=
TV
  vector and C. schultzei as an EHD and Palyam virus vector in the Sudan. T=
he
  genomes of the Sudanese virus isolates were analysed by polyacrylamide ge=
l
  electrophoresis and agarose gel electrophoresis.

AB: The natural transmission of H. meleagridis was studied over a 2-year pe=
riod
  in Florida with domestic sentinel turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo). Transmis=
sion
  began in mid-April in northern Florida with the onset of warmer weather a=
nd
  continued with occasional interruptions until the beginning of cooler win=
ter
  weather in January; transmission in the warmer subtropical climate of sou=
thern
  Florida continued at high levels throughout the year. Exposures in southe=
rn
  Florida as short as 24 h were sufficient to infect 100% of sentinel birds=
.
  Biting and light-trap collections of Culicoides capable of complete sporo=
gonic
  development of the parasite were made during each sentinel exposure. C. e=
deni
  was active throughout periods of natural transmission of H. meleagridis,
  whereas C. hinmani, C. arboricola and C. knowltoni were absent or inactiv=
e
  during cooler winter months when significant transmission occurred. The
  epizootiology of H. meleagridis in southern Florida is similar to stable
  holoendemic human malaria, where transmission may occur at high levels
  throughout the year. By contrast, transmission in the more temperate clim=
ate of
  northern Florida more closely resembled unstable hyperendemic malaria, wh=
ere
  variations in environmental conditions, host density and vector abundance=
 may
  cause wide fluctuations in the incidence of infection.

d of
  sentinel livestock near Darwin. Twenty-three isolates were made from shee=
p,
  goats, swamp buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) and horses, and the remainder were=
 from
  cattle. The isolates were typed as 27 separate viruses belonging to the
  bluetongue, epizootic haemorrhagic disease, Palyam, Simbu, bovine ephemer=
al
  fever, Tibrogargan and alphavirus groups. Ten of these viruses have not b=
een
  isolated elsewhere in Australia and four have been isolated only in Darwi=
n.
  Considerable annual variations in virus activity and in the durations of
  detectable viraemia were observed.

the
  bluetongue, epizootic haemorrhagic disease (EHD), Palyam and Simbu groups=
 with
  a single isolation of bovine ephemeral fever virus. The ECE system was fo=

  equally sensitive for recovering EHD viruses, while Palyam group viruses =
were

 to
  32% infection of sentinel larvae of Anopheles freeborni and Culex pipiens=

  1983 and up to 34% in 1984. Large numbers of nematodes were able to begin=
 new
  development cycles along transects of a field that was fallow in 1983, wh=

  indicated that some of the eggs of R. culicivorax must be resistant to
  desiccation. No definite correlation was found between nematode recycling=
 and
  external biotic or abiotic factors, although density of mosquito larvae a=
ppears
  to be important. There was little or no dispersal of nematodes from the p=

AB: A natural infection with border disease virus occurred in a flock on lo=
w
  ground in Argyll in the spring of 1984. The outbreak was unusual in that =
the
  typical clinical signs of border disease, i.e. tremor and, or, fleece cha=
nges
  were not present; manifestations of disease were restricted to abortion a=
nd the
  birth of small weak lambs. The disease was shown to have been introduced =
to the
  flock by four ewes persistently infected with border disease virus among =
a
  group of 39 purchased in October, 1983. Further investigations in late Au=
gust
  1984 detected viraemia in six of seven lambs that were not thriving and f=
our of
  24 apparently healthy lambs. Attempted 'natural vaccination' of susceptib=
le
  sheep by mixing them at grass for three months with groups of ewes and la=
mbs
  known to contain virus excretors was largely unsuccessful as only four of=
 22
  'sentinel' sheep seroconverted. In October 1984 the persistently infected
  purchased animals and all that year's lamb crop were removed from the far=
m. No
  disease occurred in 1985 when the lambing percentage was 129% compared wi=
th
  100% in 1984. Two of the four persistently infected purchased ewes were m=
ated
  at Moredun Research Institute in December 1984 and both produced healthy =
but
  persistently infected lambs.

ed
  out on a 2500-ha cattle ranch, with a history of trypanosomiasis, in the =
Coast
  Province of Kenya in 1982. One breeding focus of Glossina austeni was
  discovered in a thicket of approximately 50 ha. Trypanosomes were detecte=
d in
  20% of the 46 dissected tsetse. 0.8% of the 3315 samples from 2300 Ayrshi=
re X
  Sahiwal crossbred cattle were found infected with trypanosomes; 32% of 59=
09
  samples from the same cattle had a PCV of _ 30%. These animals were treat=
ed
  with a trypanocide (Berenil [diminazene], Ethidium [homidium bromide] or
  Novidium [homidium chloride]). Antibody to trypanosomes was detected in 2=
2.1%
  of the 343 sera collected from the cattle. A sentinel herd of 20 cattle,
  exposed for 182 days inside the tsetse-infested thicket became infected w=
ith
  Trypanosoma congolense, on average after 53 days. A 2nd, 3rd and 4th infe=
ction
  was diagnosed in 17, 11 and one animals resp. after a first treatment wit=
h
  Berenil at 6 mg/kg and this treatment was repeated after each of these
  infections. T. vivax and T. brucei were not diagnosed. The results sugges=
t that
  acquired immunity to T. congolense infection did not play a significant r=
ole in
  the sentinel cattle.

  captures of these 2 species was not correlated with altitude; instead, ad=

  average monthly temperature or rainfall at the low elevations but showed =
a
  positive correlation with average monthly temperature and rainfall at the=

  elevations. These differences between high and low elevations were believ=

AB: The concentrations of Cd, Pb and Zn in 23 species of marine animal and =
three
  species of seagrass were determined from samples collected near a large l=
ead
  smelter. The spatial patterns of metal distribution in sediments, seagras=
ses,
  crustaceans and fish could be described in terms of distance from the sme=
lter;
  clay content of the sediment and time of sample collection were also impo=
rtant.
  There was evidence for bioaccumulation in many species, especially in the
  molluscs, but no biomagnification could be detected. Although bivalve mol=
luscs
  contained high concretrations of Cd, Pb and Zn, their contents did not
  consistently relate to distance from the smelter. The choice of sentinel
  accumulators is discussed.

  over 3 weeks and by BALB/c index mice over 4 weeks, although the duration=
 of
  infection in individual index mice was often shorter. Soiled caging that
  previously housed infected mice was inconsistently infectious. Transmissi=
on was
  high in cages where infected mice died and were eaten by cagemates, but w=
as low
  to moderate in cages where there was no cannibalism. Infected mice that w=
ere
  mated 6 weeks after they were infected, delivered virus-free progeny and =
did
  not transmit infection to non-immune breeding partners. Sentinel mice hou=
sed in
  the room with experimentally infected mice were seronegative for antibody=
 to
  ectromelia virus and to other murine viruses. These results support the v=
iew
  that infection with NIH-79 virus is short-lived. They also indicate that
  breeding of recovered mice can save valuable colonies that have been expo=

AB: A disease consisting of suppurative endometritis, salpingitis,
  perioophoritis and/or peritonitis has been an important problem in aging =
B6C3F1
  mice on some chronic chemical carcinogenicity studies. Klebsiella oxytoca=
 was
  identified as the most likely causative agent based on cultural isolation=
s from
  lesions. In a survey of 684 retired female breeder mice from 10 productio=
n
  facilities, K. oxytoca was isolated from only 1% of nasopharynxes, vagina=
s and
  caeca in mice from 7 of 10 facilities. Epidemiology of the natural infect=
ion
  was investigated using the capsular and biochemical typing methods on 97
  isolates of K. oxytoca from mice of 11 production facilities and sentinel=
 mice
  from three testing facilities. A few capsular types were associated with
  lesions, non-lesion isolation sites or certain facilities, but the capsul=
ar
  typing method was not reproducible. No associations were found for any
  biotypes. A K. oxytoca isolate (capsular type 20, biotype A) from a typic=
al
  case of perioophoritis was used in attempts to reproduce the natural dise=
ase in
  Klebsiella-free B6C3F1 female mice. Mice were inoculated at 6 months of a=
ge by
  the intravaginal, intrauterine or intraperitoneal route with one of four =
doses
  of K. oxytoca and killed 4, 7 or 10 months later. Some mice given high do=
ses
  (106 or 108 cfu) of K. oxytoca died of septicaemia and a few developed mi=
ld
  inflammatory lesions in the uterus. None developed the severe suppurative
  lesions found in the natural disease. Numerous capsular and biochemical t=
ypes
  were isolated from the experimentally infected animals. It is concluded t=
hat
  unidentified factors have an aetiological role in the natural disease and=
 that
  the typing methods used for elucidating the epidemiology of K. oxytoca
  infection are unreliable.

AB: Of two groups each of 7 pregnant ewes, serologically negative for Toxop=
lasma
  with synchronized tupping dates, one was fed from day 80 of gestation a
  concentrated ration containing 30 mg/kg monensin at a rate of 0.5 kg/head=

  Group 2 received the same amount of unmedicated feed. After 10 days all a=
nimals
  in both groups received subcutaneously 1 ml mouse brain homogenate contai=
ning
  about 100 T. gondii M1 tissue cysts. One non-pregnant control animal was =
housed
  with each group as a sentinel for field Toxoplasma. Blood samples were ta=
ken
  from the time of tupping until parturition and again 10 weeks after lambi=
ng.
  All ewes injected with Toxoplasma cysts became febrile (>40=B0C) within 6=
 days
  but all temperatures were <40=B0C by day 12. Specific IgG ELISA titres ro=
se
  steeply from day 14 and remained high throughout the experiment. The sent=
inel
  animals remained serologically negative. Ewes treated with monensin produ=
ced 9
  live and 3 dead lambs; group 2 produced 5 live and 7 dead. Two of the gro=
up 1
  lambs and one group 2 lamb died within 72 hours. Lambs from treated ewes =
were
  less premature and were heavier at birth. It appears that monensin, while=
 being
  most effective in the gut lumen, has a lesser systemic action, presumably=
 by
  suppressing multiplication of T. gondii in the placentome. Characteristic
  histopathological evidence of Toxoplasma infection was found in placental
  cotyledons and/or lamb brains from all test ewes examined.

eloped
  was compared with modifications of the wet-day and Mt forecasting systems
  previously developed for use in the oceanic climate zone of western Europ=
e. The
  wet-day system correlated poorly with transmission data, whereas the Mt a=
nd
  Thornthwaite water budget-derived systems correctly ranked 5 of the 6 yea=
rs in
  terms of annual numbers of flukes transmitted to sentinel calves. Compare=
d with
  the Mt system, the water budget-based system more closely correlated with
  transmission data, on the basis of statistical regression analysis. The w=
ater
  budget system was calculated by use of a microcomputer software programme=
, and
  provided a means of measuring the effect of moisture stress and flooding =
in
  snail habitats that serve as foci of transmission of Fasciola hepatica to
  cattle on pastures.

  budget (LSU) was developed using 6 years of data on snail population dyna=
mics,
  transmission to sentinel calves, and herd prevalence rates for cattle in
  central Louisiana, USA. The system was compared with local modifications =
of the
  'Mt' and 'wet day' forecasting models. The 'Mt' and LSU systems correctly
  predicted annual transmission of flukes/calf (low, <10; moderate, 10-40; =
high,
  40-100; very high, >100) and the herd prevalence rates in 5 of the 6 year=
s. The
  'wet-day' system was poorly correlated with fluke transmission data. Thes=
e
  systems were also evaluated in the coastal marsh zone of Louisiana. LSU
  forecast index values reflected both fluke burdens in sentinel calves and=
 herd
  prevalence trends and the system is proposed as a suitable alternative to=
 the
  'Mt' method for forecasting Fasciola hepatica infection. It is convenient=
,
  requires minimal local weather data input, and has the advantage of broad
  potential application in divergent climatic zones.

AB: Twenty-two sentinel cattle were observed daily during an outbreak of
  ephemeral fever on a dairy farm in eastern Australia in the summer of 198=
1-82.
  Of the 22 cattle, 9 developed clinical ephemeral fever. None developed su=
b
  -clinical infection. The pattern of the epidemic was single index case fo=
llowed
  10 days later by the main epidemic wave which lasted for 7 days. This wav=
e
  stopped when there were still 14 uninfected susceptible animals remaining=
 in
  the sentinel group, and when biting flies were very active. Ten isolation=
s of
  bovine ephemeral fever virus were made in Aedes albopictus tissue culture=
s from
  the blood of 5 clinical cases. 112 isolations of CSIRO Village virus and =
one
  each of Kimberley and Akabane viruses were also made from various members=
 of
  the sentinel group. There was serological evidence that infections with
  Tibrogargan, Tinaroo and Aino viruses also occurred in 6 cattle in the
  observation period. The 13 cattle undergoing a sub-clinical viraemia with=
 CSIRO
  Village virus, Tibrogargan, Kimberley, Akabane or Aino viruses at the tim=
e of
  the main outbreak, appeared to be temporarily protected against ephemeral
  fever. However, 9 of the 11 still remaining in the herd were susceptible =
in a
  subsequent outbreak of ephemeral fever 2 years later. Evidence is present=
ed
  that subclinical infections with other arboviruses may limit an ephemeral=
 fever
  epidemic by providing temporary protection by interference.

  7 days. Serum calcium fell significantly during day 1 of the disease, the=
 mean
  decline being 0.22 =B1 0.08 mmol/l. The greatest individual fall was from=
 2.33 to
  1.92 mmol/l. None of the affected cattle showed any compensatory change i=

  serum magnesium. There was no change in the normal values of creatinine, =
urea,
  gamma-GT, AST and alkaline phosphatase. Bovine ephemeral fever virus was
  isolated from only four of the six cases, whereas specific antibody was

AB: Estimates of parasitism of pupae of Musca domestica were compared among
  faeces samples, pupal traps and sentinel pupae in an enclosed caged-layer
  poultry house in Indiana in 1983. The frequencies of viable, non-viable a=
nd
  parasitized pupae were significantly dependent on sampling method and fae=

  moisture. The frequencies of parasitized pupae were higher than expected =
in
  faeces samples and lower than expected in pupal traps at all but very hig=

  faeces moisture levels. The frequencies of non-viable pupae were higher i=
n
  faeces samples and sentinel-pupae bags than in pupal traps at higher faec=
es
  moisture levels. The frequencies of parasitized pupae were higher in all
  samples at lower faeces moisture levels. Four parasite species, Spalangia
  cameroni, S. endius, S. nigroaenea and Muscidifurax raptor, emerged from =
the
  parasitized pupae. Parasitism by S. cameroni was higher than expected, an=
d that
  by S. nigroaenea was lower than expected in sentinel-pupae bags in compar=
ison
  with the other sampling methods. The results indicated that each sampling
  method might lead to biased estimates of Musca domestica pupal viability =
and
  parasitism, but that estimates from pupal traps might be the least biased=
 and
  most efficiently obtained.

AB: A discrete population of Anopheles balabacensis was studied in a fringe=
 area
  of a mixed secondary tropical forest in western Sabah, Malaysia. Blood-fe=
d
  females were collected daily in outdoor bare-leg catches in sentinel stat=
ions,
  marked with fluorescent powders, released and recaptured. By varying the =
colour
  used for marking, estimates were made of the distance of dispersal from t=
he
  release point to other stations, the daily survival rate and the proporti=
on of
  the wild populations caught in sentinel stations each day. The best estim=
ates
  of daily survival were 0.719 and 0.7874, but these figures did not match =
well
  with an independently derived result from parity dissections. This was th=
ought
  to be the first time that an independent check had been used to determine=
 the
  accuracy of mark-release-recapture methods for determining survival rates=
 of
  this species. The recovery rate of marked mosquitoes averaged 16.1%. Disp=
ersal
  studies showed that movement within the forest fringe was almost random u=
p to
  112 m from the release point. Estimated population sizes declined from 11=
 000
  to 5500 during the experiment. The results suggested that the majority of
  individuals of A. balabacensis from any one brood probably survived for a=
s long
  as 13 days after emergence during the normal inter-monsoon weather condit=
ions
  in the western part of Sabah.

AB: Investigations on the ecology of Ockelbo disease, presumed to be caused=
 by
  Sindbis virus, were carried out near Esdbyn, Sweden, in 1983. A total of =
266
  pools of 11 154 female and 2179 male mosquitoes, collected in March-Octob=
er
  with animal-baited traps, light traps and from man, cattle sheds and
  overwintering sites was processed for virus isolation attempts. Sindbis v=
irus
  was isolated from 2 pools of unengorged females. One of the pools consist=
ed of
  50 females of Culex pipiens and the other from 24 of Culiseta morsitans,
  collected between 20 July and 3 August. Sera from sentinel bait animals w=
ere
  drawn at 2-week intervals in May-September, and Sindbis virus neutralizin=
g
  antibodies were found in a pigeon in August. These results strengthen the
  hypothesis that Sindbis virus circulates in a sylvatic cycle involving
  ornithophagous culicines and birds. Inkoo virus (California serogroup),
  previously known only from Finland, was isolated from 1 pool of 100 uneng=
orged
  females of Aedes communis collected between 21 June and 5 July. The high
  prevalence of Inkoo virus neutralizing antibodies detected in human sera
  indicates that this virus is widely distributed in Sweden.

  within a 7.2-km radius of a turkey farm were treated with a wettable powd=
er
  formulation of Bacillus thuringiensis. Erratic and high levels of precipi=
tation
  during 1981 prevented adequate treatment of the streams. A more frequent
  treatment schedule was maintained in 1982, resulting in substantial decre=
ases
  in the blood parasitaemia levels of L. smithi in sentinel and commercial =
flocks
  of turkeys, and no losses or observable pathology in these birds. In 1982=
, as
  in previous years, infection levels were higher in ranged turkeys that in
  housed birds. During 1982, L. smithi gametocyte levels were much higher i=
n
  housed turkeys than those observed in previous years. This reflected the
  greater numbers of Simulium vectors entering the houses to feed; however,=
 the
  reasons for this are unclear.

AB: In the Bakersfield area of Kern County, California, populations of Cule=
x
  tarsalis resistant to all available organophosphorus insecticides cause a=
nnual
  epizootics of western equine encephalitis and present a constant risk of
  infection to the largely non-immune human population nearby. The progress=
 of
  resistance of this culicid to Baygon [propoxur], malathion and chlorpyrif=
os was
  investigated in laboratory and field studies in 1983 on adults from vario=
us
  localities in Kern County. Susceptibility to malathion and chlorpyrifos w=
as too
  variable from place to place to permit the effective use of these compund=
s for
  the emergency suppression of C. tarsalis during an epidemic. In the case =
of
  propoxur, mortality was comparatively consistent, regardless of the geogr=
aphic
  origin of the test mosquitoes. However, successive decline in average mos=
quito
  mortality in sentinel cages placed in transects exposed to propoxur spray=
s from
  aircraft, in cages outside the spray zone where traps baited with carbon
  dioxide were present, and in cages sheltered by vegetation, was attribute=
d to
  the amount of plant canopy protecting each group; this indicated that the
  target populations were susceptible to propoxur when directly exposed to =
spray
  particles.

AB: The postparasitic stage of the mermithid Romanomermis culicivorax and t=
he
  asexual stage of the fungus Lagenidium giganteum were studied in rice fie=
lds in
  California, and the oospores of this fungus in the laboratory. The result=
s of
  the field tests were monitored with sentinel cages containing larvae of C=
ulex
  pipiens (for R. culicivorax) and of Anopheles freeborni or C. tarsalis (f=
or L.
  giganteum). The nematodes overwintered successfully along 8 different lin=
es of
  inoculation in 4 rice fields. Infection rates were 0-32%, without obvious
  correlation with differing application rates (25, 50 or 150 g postparasit=
es/100
  m) or methods. Infection rates of 21-86% were found in mosquito larvae ca=
ged
  along inoculation transects, and low infection levels at up to 10 m from
  release points. In field tests with L. giganteum, the asexual stage at al=
l
  rates successfully infected A. freeborni and C. tarsalis. In the laborato=
ry the
  oospores, activated by successive dehydration and rehydration, germinated=
 over
  a period of several months. At the lowest oospore dosage tested (3 X
  104/litre), an infection peak occurred after 7 days and gave 50% infectio=
n for
  20 days, and at dosages of 1.5 or 3 X 105/litre, infection rates of at le=
ast
  80% remained for about 30 days, with some activity persisting for a furth=
er 21
  days.

AB: In preliminary field studies at 27 sites in Sutter and Yuba Counties of
  California on the biological control of culicid larvae by means of Romano=
mermis
  culicivorax, preparasites of this mermithid were placed at 1000/m2 where
  mosquito larvae were present at densities greater than 1 larva/dip, and
  postparasites at 0.4 g/m in sites where the mosquito density was lower.
  Sentinel cages containing laboratory-reared larvae of Culex pipiens were =
placed
  for 48 h in release sites where no wild larvae could be recovered after
  treatment. Of the 22 sites sampled for infested mosquito larvae, 13 prove=
d
  positive, with infestation rates of 27.85=B19.09%. Infestation tended to =
decline
  between June and September, but no relationship was found between infesta=
tion
  and soil or water temperatures, soil types or degree of shading by tree
  canopies. Heavy mortality of sentinel larvae (infected or not by R.
  culicivorax) could not be definitely explained, and multiple parasitism o=
r
  water quality are suggested as possible reasons. The application rate of =
0.4 g
  postparasites/m in this study was observed to be much more effective than=
 the
  rate of 0.1 g previously used.

  treated with corticosteroids. Viral shedding could not be detected. Expla=

  corticosteroid treatment was required to trigger reactivation. In both pi=
gs,
  sufficient reactivated virus was excreted to infect susceptible sentinel =
pigs.
  Restriction endonuclease analysis indicated that viruses isolated from th=

  pigs after challenge exposure and corticosteroid treatment were
  indistinguishable from the virulent virus. Evidence was not obtained for
  simultaneous excretion of vaccinal and virulent virus. Of 4 pigs without
  maternal antibody vaccinated twice with 1 of 2 inactivated vaccines, chal=

  exposed on PVD 84, and treated with corticosteroids on postchallenge expo=
sure
  day 63 (PVD 147), 1 was latently infected, as evidenced by the shedding o=

  virus (experiment 3). However, its sentinel pig remained uninfected. Seem=
ingly,

  throughout the year. From the 39 batches of mosquitoes examined
  reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) was isolated on seven occasions: once i=
n
  summer and six times in autumn. Isolation of REV twice from unengorged
  mosquitoes from a pen with persistently viraemic chickens and once from
  engorged mosquitoes in a pen with sentinel chickens implied that feeding =
on the
  viraemic birds had been interrupted. Mechanical transmission of REV could=
 have
  occurred when unengorged mosquitoes contaminated with REV completed their
  feeding on sentinel chickens. The birds developed REV antibodies after RE=
V
  isolation from sentinel pens. REV was experimentally transmitted from
  persistently viraemic donor chickens to a recipient chicken using C.

ing in

e
  usual onset was 6 to 8 weeks after the detection of influenza in ducks.
  Possible explanations for the delayed infection in turkeys are (i) increa=
sed
  waterfowl activity associated with fledging and congregating in late summ=
er and
  early autumn; (ii) vectors transmitting virus from the waterfowl habitat =
to
  poultry farms; (iii) cooler environmental temperature, allowing prolonged=

 and
  (vi) virus adaptation in domestic turkeys before infection is detected. I=
t was

  have a seasonal infection that appears to be related to seasonal influenz=
a
  outbreaks in domestic turkeys in Minnesota. However, only some influenza =
A
  virus isolates circulating among waterfowl at any given time appear capab=

  causing infection in turkeys. It is suggested that the seasonal infection=

  a normal mean of 2.55 to 2.0 mmol/l occurred on the day clinical signs we=

ree.
  Plasma fibrinogen rose from a normal mean of 5 to a peak of 18 g/l on the
  second day of disease and fell towards normal in the week after recovery.
  Neutralizing antibodies to bovine ephemeral fever virus were detected up =

  days prior to clinical disease, and the rise of antibody after recovery w=
as
  secondary in pattern. Serological evidence of a prior infection with an
  antigenically related virus, Kimberley virus, was found in these animals.=
 In

AB: The first isolation of bluetongue virus (BTV) serotype 2 in the USA was=
 in
  1982 from a sentinel herd of cattle at Ona, Florida. Electrophoresis of g=
enome
  RNA showed that all 16 serotype 2 isolates from this focus of infection h=
ad one
  of two electropherotypes (Ona A and Ona B). All genome segments of Ona A =
and
  Ona B had detectable differences in electrophoretic mobility, with major
  differences noted for segments 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10. Electrophoretic
  comparison revealed that Ona A was indistinguishable from the African ser=
otype
  2 prototype isolated 23 years earlier. In 1983, Ona B, in the apparent ab=
sence
  of Ona A, was isolated from two additional cattle herds in Florida. These
  results suggest that Ona B may be a variant of Ona A that evolved as a re=
sult
  of mutation of reassortment with another BTV strain, and may be better ad=
apted
  to the selective pressures found in southern Florida. Comparison of the
  electropherotypes of Ona B with two Florida isolates of serotype 13 and 1=
7 and
  the prototypes of BTV 10, 11, 13 or 17 produced no evidence for reassortm=
ent
  between Ona A and any of these strains as the possible origin of Ona B.

  isolation of arboviruses in Australia. However, detailed information on t=
he
  growth of these viruses in the cells was lacking, so the effects of diffe=
rent
  incubation temperatures on the growth of 5 Australian arboviruses (one
  epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus serotype (Reoviridae), 2 Akabane vir=
us
  strains (Bunyaviridae) and 3 bovine ephemeral fever group viruses
  (Rhabdoviridae)) were investigated. A. albopictus cells supported the gro=
wth of
  all the viruses, but not necessarily at all the temperatures tested (15, =
20, 28
  and 33=B0C). It is not unusual to find 3 different arbovirus groups circu=
lating
  in an insect population and herd of sentinel cattle, and it is suggested =
that
  it may be possible to manipulate the isolation technique to favour the
  isolation of a particular virus.

 the

colour
  change. In sucrose density-gradient fractionated serum from recently infe=

, 2
  -mercaptoethanol-sensitive haemagglutination-inhibiting (HAI) antibody
  activity. Within 2-3 days, JEV-infected sentinel pigs developed high JEV =
IgM
  activity; this activity decreased within 2 weeks. Among specimens collect=
ed at
  random from 99 swine at abattoirs in Thailand during a period of low JEV
  transmission, none of 25 JEV HAI-negative sera had JEV IgM activity, 7 of=
 74
  JEV HAI-positive sera had JEV IgM activity, and the remaining 67 sera had
  readily detectable JEV HAI antibodies, but lacked JEV IgM. The JEV IgM so=
lid

  (Chaco Province) from species of Culex, were found in horses and rodents =
in
  that region. The demonstration of seroconversions in sentinel horses and =
of
  antibodies in birds and wild mammals indicates active transmission of
  Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus. In 1980, a new enzootic subty=
pe of
  VEE virus (AG80-663) was isolated from mosquitoes in Chaco; neutralizing
  antibodies to this virus were prevalent in horses and rodents in this are=
a.
  Infections with Aura and Una viruses were most common in the subtropical
  northern provinces. Infection with St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus was
  prevalent and widespread, and birds, principally passerine and columbifor=
m
  species, appear to be the principal hosts. An interesting and unexplained
  finding was the absence of arbovirus antibodies, in particular SLE antibo=
dies
  in house sparrows (Passer domesticus). Antibodies to 2 new virues, Barran=
queras
  and Resistencia, which had been isolated from Culex spp. in Chaco Provinc=
e,
  were found in rodents there. Immunity to Gamboa group viruses was prevale=
nt,
  and birds were implicated as principal hosts.

AB: Sterile flies from a prospective mass-production strain of Cochliomyia

  1981 in the Pacific coastal plain of Chiapas, Mexico. In Test I, flies we=

s were
  located 5-23 km (including 5 sites at <10 km) from the nearest perimeter.=
 The
  maximum egg-mass sterility rate (25%) was obtained by the 3rd of 6 weeks =
of
  sterile fly releases. In Test II, flies were released over a 40 X 80-km a=
rea
  where all 8 sentinel sheep pens were located 18.5-34.5 km from the neares=
t
  perimeter. For all pens, the maximum egg-mass sterility rate (38%) was ob=
tained
  by the 4th week. Egg-mass sterility rates at sites considered well-insula=
ted
  from the perimeter were statistically higher than sterility rates at site=
s
  considered poorly insulated. In Test II, distance from the sentinel sheep
  sampling sites to the nearest perimeter of the fly release area and egg-m=
ass
  sterility rate were positively correlated, and a maximum sterility rate o=
f 60%
  was recorded. This relationship was attributed, at least in part, to the
  movement of native females of C. hominivorax into the test area from untr=

AB: This paper describes an ingenious and unusual investigation. Designed t=
o
  test the hypothesis that bovine ephemeral fever (BEF) overwinters in the
  Flinders River area, the veterinary service combined with the microbiolog=
ical
  service of CSIRO in planning and execution, and medical research workers =
joined
  the team to investigate Murray Valley encephalitis. Difficulties encounte=
red
  were formidable: as an example, aircraft were sometimes the only way to r=
each
  farms during the monsoon season and, having reached the farm, the operato=
r had
  to leave soon enough to ensure his safe return, thus allowing little time=
 in
  which to do all the work. That such difficulties were surmounted speaks w=
ell
  for the staff. Results of the survey provided circumstantial evidence tha=
t BEF
  does overwinter in the area, but in which animal is unknown. Since the ag=
ent is
  probably an arbovirus, the reservoir may be insect, mammal or bird. Senti=
nel
  cattle, sheep, horses and fowls were kept in various herds and tested eac=
h
  month. Cattle developed antibodies to bovine ephemeral fever, Akabane, Ai=
no,
  Bunyip Ross River viruses. Horses developed antibodies to Ross River and
  Akabane viruses. Fowls developed antibodies to Murray Valley encephalitis=
,
  Kunjin and Sindbis viruses. No antibodies were detected in sheep.

  breeding boars would be good sentinel animals. In 1981, APHIS accepted a
  recommendation of the U.S. Animal Health Association that field trials sh=
ould
  be carried out. Data on the health status of boars in infected herds were
  accumulated from questionnaires completed on each herd found infected in =
the
  USA for the duration of the trial. Another trial was carried out on the
  traceability of boars to their herds of origin under current marketing me=
thods.
  Sufficient data on which to draw conclusions were expected to be availabl=

AB: S. haematobium miracidia were detected in sentinel snails (Bulinus rohl=
fsi)
  placed in 16 human water contact sites in the Volta Lake, each month from=
 March
  1973 to November 1977. The results showed that rates of infection were se=
asonal
  and that infected snails were more often found in water contact sites she=
ltered
  by emergent plant growth than in exposed open beach sites with no emergen=
t
  vegetation. Sentinel snail infection rates were correlated with natural s=
nail
  infection rates and with epidemiological levels of schistosomiasis in vil=
lage
  inhabitants. After 2 years of chemotherapy and molusciciding, levels of d=
isease
  and sentinel snail infection rates dropped in two-thirds of the villages.=
 In
  the remaining villages, however, the sentinel snail infection rates were =
not
  correlated with the fall in epidemiological level, because of ecological
  changes in the water contact sites. It is concluded that unless control
  measures are continued, the constant changes in the lake shore environmen=
t will
  lead to a rapid re-establishment of previous levels of disease transmissi=
on.

  sent in weekly forms indicating the numbers of animals bought, sold, kill=
ed,
  lost or stolen, born, died, immunized, or wormed, was set up. The early r=

  indicated brood cow mortality of 3% and nursing calf mortality of 10%;
  immunization and deworming appeared to be carried out at any time and sal=
es of
  animals preceded purchases by two weeks. In a number of the herds, design=
ated
  sentinel herds, groups of 15 cows and calves were examined regularly by
  veterinarians to determine the presence and distribution of pathogens. Th=
e
  objectives of this part of the programme were to provide accurate records=
 on
  prevalence of pathogens, particularly respiratory pathogens, to determine=
 the
  movement of infection within herds and between dams and their calves, to =
obtain
  complete case studies of normal herds and to develop the base-line data
  necessary for planning appropriate herd health programmes for beef herds =
in
  Louisiana. Preliminary data show Bacillus sp. and staphylococci were most
  frequently isolated from young (pre-weaning) calves and Pasteurella and
  Moraxella were more frequently isolated from weaned calves. Apart from Ba=
cillus
  there was no clear pattern of spread of pathogens from dam to calf. Altho=
ugh
  farmers claimed that parasites were a major problem in the sentinel herds=
, they
  were adequately controlled.

  Application of B. t. israelensis by aircraft, mist-blower or aerosol gene=

  ground sprays depended on the distance of the larvae from the point of
  application. R. culicivorax gave up to 46% larval infection, and its incr=

  numbers 3-4 weeks after introduction indicated that a single application =
of

  season. The asexual stage of L. giganteum introduced into seepage ditches=
 was
  able to control Culex populations in rice fields, and continued to multip=

AB: In a longitudinal study of bluetongue virus (BTV) and related viruses i=
n an
  area of California known to be endemic for BTV and epizootic haemorrhagic
  disease virus (EHDV), the order of decreasing susceptibility of different
  sentinel animals to BTV (as determined by virus isolation) was dairy calv=
es,
  sheep, deer, goats and beef cows. However, using seroconversion, the bovi=
ne and
  ovine species appeared to be equally susceptible to infection, followed b=
y
  goats and deer. The study confirmed earlier reports of herds, as well as
  individual animals, becoming infected with multiple serotypes of BTV. The
  predominant serotype isolated from all species, including pools of Culico=
ides
  variipennis (Coq.), was BTV-11. The single isolation of BTV-13 from C.
  variipennis late in the autumn was probably due to its late introduction =
into
  the area. No overwintering mechanism for BTV was identified. The possible=
 part
  played by vectors in the initial source of BTV in the area is discussed.
  Serological tests demonstrated that 6 of 8 dairy calves tested had been
  infected with EHDV.

aken
  in light-traps operated near cattle on the islands of Puerto Rico, St. Cr=
oix
  and Barbados during a survey in the Caribbean for possible vectors of
  bluetongue virus; a recent serological survey on goats, sheep and cattle =
in the
  Caribbean had shown that infection with bluetongue virus was common there=
. Peak
  numbers of C. insignis and of C. pusillus were taken at the time that mos=
t
  sentinel calves seroconverted to bluetongue virus in Puerto Rico. The evi=
dence
  therefore strongly suggests that these species are implicated in the

AB: Latency of pseudorabies [Aujeszky's] virus (PRV) was established in 8 o=
f 9
  pigs born to 2 vaccinated sows. Pigs had high, low, or no maternal antibo=
dy
  titres at the time of the initial inoculation. At 3 to 4 months after
  inoculation, latent PRV could be reactivated in vivo by the administratio=
n of
  large doses of corticosteroids. In most pigs, the stress-simulating treat=
ment
  resulted in recrudescence of virus shedding after lag periods of 4 to 11 =
days.
  In 3 pigs, virus shedding was without clinical signs of disease, whereas
  clinical signs that developed in 4 pigs appeared to be due to the
  corticosteroid treatment, rather than to the reactivation of PRV. Pigs wi=
th a
  log10 neutralizing antibody titre of _ 2.55 at the onset of corticosteroi=
d
  treatment had a booster response. Reactivated PRV spread to sentinel pigs
  housed with the inoculated pigs. Reactivation of PRV was also demonstrate=
d in
  vitro. Explant cultures of trigeminal ganglia from pigs killed between 4 =
to 5
  months after inoculation produced infectious virus. Restriction endonucle=
ase
  analysis indicated that the reactivated PRV was indistinguishable from vi=
rus
  isolated shortly after the primary infection. Seemingly, pigs with matern=
al
  antibodies can become latently infected and therefore may be regarded as
  potential sources of dissemination of PRV.

 and
  biological tests. A state of emergency was declared in the eastern provin=
ces
  and a state of alert in the rest of the country. Slaughter of pigs in the=
 areas
  affected by the disease was carried out, as well as systematic disinfecti=
on of
  farms, properties and installations. Epidemiological vigilance permitted =
the
  examination of all the animals, their revaccination against classical swi=
ne
  fever and the submission of samples to special laboratories. Strict quara=
ntine
  was established. The programme of eradication included the introduction o=
f
  sentinel pigs into the outbreak sites to confirm the absence of the virus=
 and
  allow the gradual repopulation of the affected provinces. No further case=
s were
  observed after 2nd March.

AB: This report covers the period April 1982-March 1983. Twelve current res=
earch
  projects (mainly epidemiological surveys of different diseases) are liste=
d, and
  aims and methods described. Preliminary results indicate that Trypanosoma
  evansi infection is present at all three locations sampled, but at low
  prevalence. Among animals slaughtered at Bogor, mouse inoculation yielded=
 T.
  evansi from two (0.8%) of 254 cattle and four (8%) of 50 buffaloes. T. th=
eileri
  was isolated from 33% of 128 cattle and 48% of 25 buffaloes. Fasciola hep=
atica
  was found in 17% of 161 cattle and 53% of 30 buffaloes at Bogor abattoir.=
 Of
  381 serum samples from slaughter cattle (mainly young males), 22.6% were
  positive for Leptospira, mainly L. hardjo and L. tarassovi, but all were
  negative for brucellosis. Among 524 dairy cattle (434 from East Java), 0.=
5%
  were positive reactors for brucellosis in East Java but none in Central a=
nd
  West Java. Of 1744 quarter milk samples from 31 dairy cattle farms in Eas=
t Java
  66.4% were positive to the Aulendorfer mastitis probe; pathogens isolated=
 were
  chiefly Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and streptococci. No isolat=
ion of
  Campylobacter fetus venerealis was made from 95 cows and 1000 bulls. A na=
tional
  sentinel herd scheme using cattle, buffaloes, sheep and goats has been se=
t up
  at seven locations throughout Java.

AB: After treatment with 160 mg of dexamethasone daily for 5 days, Aujeszky=
's
  virus was isolated from 2 of 3 adult littermate boars that carried antibo=
dies
  to the virus. These pigs also transferred infection to a SPF sentinel pen=
mate.
  After dexamethasone treatment, increased lymphocyte stimulation indices w=
ere
  detected in all virus seropositive pigs. Aujeszky's virus was not isolate=
d from
  a seronegative littermate gilt of the seropositive boars. The gilt also
  remained seronegative and negative for lymphocyte transformation. Before
  dexamethasone treatment, the 3 boars and 1 gilt were seronegative to the =
serum
  neutralization (SN) test at 11 weeks of age. At 13 weeks of age while sti=
ll SN
  negative, these pigs were moved to a building and randomly penned with 76=
 other
  SN-negative pigs. At 18 weeks of age, all pigs in the building were PR vi=
rus
  seronegative, but at 25 weeks of age, the 3 boars were seropositive and t=
he
  gilt was seronegative. There were no other pigs in the building that had
  antibodies to PR virus before the addition or after the removal of these =
pigs.
  Seemingly, the 3 boars were infected with Aujeszky's virus before 13 week=
s of
  age indicating that infection of swine may occur in the absence of detect=
able
  SN antibodies.

  The parameters more than 20 C. tarsalis females/trap per week in late Jun=

  early July, and more than 25% C. tarsalis females in flock trap collectio=
ns in
  this period, are criteria which might be used in future to predict outbre=

  population levels of C. tarsalis. Culiseta inornata (Will.) and Aedes vex=
ans
  (Mg.) are unlikely to be involved in the transmission of WEE virus to equ=
ines

vels,
  and their population peaks do not coincide with transmission peaks for WE=
E.
  They may be involved in amplifying the virus in spring.

s and
  4% in L. capensis. Transmission to sentinel rabbits in an enzootic area i=

ttidia
  perturbans (Wlk.). At 26=B0C, infective larvae were first found in the mo=
uthparts
  10 days after infection. In the most suitable intermediate hosts (A. eued=
es and
  A. excrucians), fat-body syncytia with hypertrophied adipocyte nuclei for=
med
  around larvae. Syncytia commonly did not form, or formed abnormally, arou=
nd
  larvae in less suitable hosts, such as A. aegypti, A. stimulans and A. fi=
tchii.
  D. scapiceps developed to the subadult stage in subcutaneous tissues in v=
arious
  regions of the body of experimentally infected rabbits (S. floridanus). T=
he 3rd
  and 4th moults occurred after 6 and 12 days, respectively. Subadults migr=
ated
  through subcutaneous tissues and arrived in the ankle as early as 16 days=
. The
  prepatent period was 137-240 days.

ed out
  in July-August 1983 in the Sevier River area of Utah, since many parts of=
 the
  region had been flooded owing to unusually heavy rainfall in the previous
  autumn, winter and spring. Mosquitoes were collected by means of New Jers=
ey
  light traps and traps baited with carbon dioxide and New Jersey light tra=
ps. A
  total of 12 mosquito species was caught (22 094 individuals), of which th=
e
  commonest was C. tarsalis. Mosquito pools, and also sentinel chickens and=
 a
  duck at Richfield and Deseret, all proved negative for WEE and SLE; the
  continuance of the encephalitis surveillance programme is however recomme=
nded
  in view of the high mosquito density and the prediction of further abnorm=

  data on the prevalence of tickborne and other disease problems in these a=

  and to monitor changes in individual herds. In the questionnaire survey, =
288
  farmers were interviewed. They owned a total of 15 360 head of cattle,
  representing approximately one percent of the national herd. Mean herd si=
zes
  ranged from 31 to 114 for each district. Mean calving percentages were 44=
-80%.
  Average national offtake from these herds was 10%. Calf mortality rates r=
anged
  from 4 to 32%, while adult yearly mortality rates ranged from 4 to 16%. F=
armers
  considered unthriftiness to be the most important health problem, followe=
d by
  subcutaneous oedema, sudden death and lameness. The importance of these
  conditions varied with region. Factors affecting the regional variation o=

AB: Repeated outbreaks of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus in man and
  equines in the Guajira region of Venezuela indicated the possible existen=
ce of
  a sylvatic focus of an epizootic subtype of the virus. A surveillance sys=
tem
  was established, and attempts were made to isolate the virus from 67 760
  mosquitoes of 18 species and from sentinel hamsters. Sixteen isolates of
  eastern equine encephalitis virus were recovered from Culex dunni and C.
  panocossa [C. aikenii] and a strain of Itaqui virus was recovered from Ae=
des
  taeniorhynchus, while 60 isolates of eastern equine encephalitis, 2 of
  Venezuelan equine encephalitis and 2 of Itaqui viruses were recovered fro=
m
  hamster tissues. Evidence for the presence of both viruses in small wild
  vertebrates was obtained as a result of serological testing. The study sh=
owed,
  for the first time, the enzootic presence of both Venezuelan equine
  encephalitis (prototype ID) and eastern equine encephalitis viruses durin=
g a

AB: Surveys in California for arthropod-borne and especially mosquito-borne
  viruses were continued in 1981 [see RAE/B 70, 3255] by means both of
  serological tests of human and equine cases of suspected encephalitis and=
 of
  tests of mosquito pools for viruses. No human cases of western equine
  encephalitis (WEE) or of St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) were confirmed duri=
ng the
  year, and only 1 equine case of WEE. A total of 2205 pools of mosquitoes =
(104
  439 individuals) was collected, of which 92.3% consisted of Culex tarsali=
s Coq.
  and members of the species-complex of C. pipiens L.; 48 isolations were m=
ade of
  WEE, 2 of SLE, 100 of Hart Park virus, 65 of Turlock virus and 8 of the
  California encephalitis group. Sentinel flocks of domestic fowls were exp=
osed
  in 22 localities; 11 flocks developed antibodies to WEE and 3 to SLE. The
  prospects for 1982 were that high run-off resulting from heavy rainfall a=
nd
  snowfall during the winter of 1981-82 would give conditions favourable to
  excessive mosquito breeding, and that extensive surveillance and control
  measures would be necessary to prevent epidemics of encephalitis in Calif=
ornia.

AB: From 1975 to 1978, 36 viruses were recovered from man, bats, birds, sen=
tinel
  mice and hamsters, and from Culex sacchettae Sirivanakarn & Jakob, C. tae=
niopus
  D. & K. and C. epanastasis Dyar, all of the subgenus Melanoconion, collec=
ted in
  coastal Brazil in the State of Sao Paulo. Identifications of 22 of these =
36
  viruses have been reported. Six of the remaining 14 isolates were shown t=
o be
  Guama serogroup bunyaviruses. Two of these 6were strains of a newly recog=
nised
  virus for which the name Cananeia virus is proposed; another is a second =
newly
  recognised Guama serogroup virus for which the name Itimirim virus is pro=
posed;
  a fourth is a strain of Bertioga virus and the other 2 are strains of Gua=
ratuba
  virus. Before these studies Guaratuba virus was considered an ungrouped
  bunyavirus, but cross-testing by complement-fixation demonstrated that th=
is
  virus, and Mirim virus as well, should be considered members of the Guama
  serogroup. Another 6 viruses were shown to be strains of a single, newly
  recognised Group C bunyavirus for which the name Bruconha virus is propos=
ed.
  Two strains of a single virus were shown by electron microscopy to belong=
 to
  the family Bunyaviridae, but serological relationships with other members=
 of
  this family of viruses were not found; the name Enseada virus is proposed=
 for
  this newly recognised agent.

  campaign (1970 to 1975), and a surveillance/treatment programme supplemen=
ted
  with selective population chemotherapy in 1975 and 1976, prevalence rates=
 of S.
  mansoni were reduced to low levels. To prevent a resurgence of transmissi=
on a
  cost-effective routine focal mollusciciding programme, suitable for publi=
c
  health implementation was evaluated from 1977 to 1981. Streams and main
  collector drains in banana fields, considered to be potential S. mansoni
  transmission sites, were treated every 4 weeks with Bayluscide 6076
  emulsifiable concentrate (Clonitralide). Snail populations were controlle=
d in
  the treated areas but large numbers were present where no treatment was g=
iven.
  Only 0.06% of sentinel snails became infected. Prevalence of infection in=
 the
  human population remained low (over-all 5%) and intensity of infection at=
 a
  level not normally associated with schistosomal disease. Since control st=
arted
  10 years earlier the level of potential contamination has fallen by 92% i=
n high
  transmission areas. The 4 year programme cost US$12 909, of which 54% was=
 for
  molluscicide, 27% for labour and 19% for transport, equipment and sundrie=
s. The
  average annual cost per head of population was US$0.46. [AS]

ugust
  and then declined to 1.7% in mid-September. Cercarial output by 10 infect=
ed
  snails (monitored from 6 July to 18 September) varied markedly and was a
  function of water temperature. It rose rapidly in early July to a maximum=
 near
  the end of the month, after which a precipitous decline occurred. A 2nd m=
inor
  peak occurred during the first half of September. Sentinel fish (Salvelin=
us
  fontinalis) were put in the pond from 20-30 July, 30 July to 20 August an=
d 21
  August-15 September. The numbers of metacercariae acquired per 48 h by th=
e fish
  in these 3 periods were 2.3, 7.0 and 2.5, respectively. This pattern of
  cercarial acquisition corresponded with cercarial availability which was
  calculated as the product of the rate of cercarial release, the expected
  cercarial life-span and the prevalence of infected snails.

  serotypes with the isolates D'Aguilar B8112, CSIRO 11, CSIRO 58 and CSIRO=
 82 as
  the type strains. The latter three were new to Australia. Like other
  orbiviruses, these four serotypes were partly sensitive to treatment with=
 ether

ssion,
  sex and breed, were selected. Sixteen owners of cases and 32 controls wer=
e
  interviewed to determine their occupation and smoking habits, and their d=
og's
  medical history, lifestyle, diet and exposure to asbestos. Results were
  analyzed using a matched technique for each control separately and combin=

  controls. A significant odds ratio was found with an asbestos-related
  occupation. Analysis of lung tissue from two cases revealed prominent
  accumulations of asbestos fibres. Implications of this sentinel model are

AB: Feline viral rhinotracheitis (FVR) virus could be successfully transmit=
ted
  between shedding carrier cats and unrelated susceptible kittens, but only=
 if
  there was intimate contact between them. Studies on the transmission of F=
VR
  virus from carrier queens to their kittens showed that although four of 1=
0
  queens shed virus in the post partum period, a total of only four kittens=
 from
  three litters developed a contact infection. All four kittens remained
  asymptomatic. Two shed for one day only and did not become carriers (as
  evidenced by corticosteroid treatment) and two shed for 15 days and 25 da=
ys and
  were subsequently shown to have become carriers. None of the remaining ki=
ttens
  tested shed virus. There was no evidence of in utero transmission between=
 FVR
  -recovered queens and kittens. Passive antibody titres in kittens born to=
 FVR
  -recovered queens declined to less than 1 in 4 in individual animals by t=
wo to
  10 weeks of age. Mean titres calculated from a linear regression equation
  reached less than 1 in 4 and less than 1 in 2 by six and nine weeks of ag=
e,
  respectively. Experiments using a multistage liquid impinger demonstrated=
 that
  FVR virus was unlikely to be transmitted between cats by aerosol and this=
 was
  confirmed by the ability of a sentinel cat to withstand virus shedding fr=
om
  carriers over a six month period, although housed in the same air space.

  farms has been undertaken since 1977 in seven Departments of France. The =
flow
  of information from veterinarians and farmers in the field, to and from t=

  various official laboratories, is described. Records provide statistics o=
n
  numbers, symptoms, diagnosis, mortality, composition of rations, details =
of
  calvings and insemination, milk-production records, leukocyte counts in m=
ilk,
  and many other factors. A comparison of disease conditions observed in su=
ckling
  cows and milking cows is presented. Statistics of serological diagnoses a=
re
  given. The important condition of infertility and its causes are discusse=
d.
  Available statistics suggested that cows in loose housing had better fert=
ility
  than cows in tethered housing, but under loose housing respiratory affect=
ions
  in young animals were more frequent. Between November 1977 and January 19=
79, in
  "sentinel" herds in two Departments, the commonest condition in suckling =
cows
  was non-haemorrhagic diarrhoea (8.1%), but in milking cows clinical masti=
tis
  (25.2%) was the commonest, followed by endometritis (13.7%) and lameness
  (13.4%).

AB: In the United States, Fasciola hepatica is found primarily in Gulf Coas=

  pastures. Direct loss from the condemnation of livers in 1981 was $7.2 mi=
llion.
  Losses from lowered weight gain in subclinical infections were not estima=
ted.
  Epidemiological studies in Louisiana revealed that most transmission to c=
attle
  occurred in the spring and early summer. Annual variation in the number o=
f
  flukes transmitted was correlated with climatic variables determining the
  number of snail intermediate hosts available for infection. Herd prevalen=
ce and
  sentinel calf data suggest that annual autumnal treatment with albendazol=
e was
  effective for sustained reduction of fluke burdens in low risk years, but=
 at
  least two treatments are required in high risk years. Feedlot studies ind=
icate
  that albendazole treatment may improve average daily gain and feed effici=
ency
  in infected feeder calves. Beef herd performance was improved by treatmen=
t
  directed at reducing loss of cow condition during winter. Further studies=
 to
  develop more cost effective strategic control measures are recommended.

  Immunofluorescence tests showed that it was related to both bovine epheme=

  fever (BEF) and Tortilla Flat viruses, though more strongly to the former=
. The
  steer had neutralizing antibody to all three viruses at the time of isola=
tion.
  Of 478 serum samples from cattle in different parts of Australia, 20% had
  neutralizing antibodies to both BEF and DPP63 viruses. However, a serolog=
ical
  survey would not give meaningful results because of the antigenic overlap=

AB: The pathogenesis of group E streptococcal abscesses of swine which occu=
r at
  sites other than the head and neck (atypical sites) was studied after gro=
ups of
  swine were each inoculated by 1 of 4 routes (intragastric, intraenteric,
  footpad, or intratracheal). Abscesses were observed in the head and neck =
of all
  swine and at atypical sites in 3 of the 5 swine inoculated by the intraga=
stric
  route. In 20 swine inoculated by the intraenteric route, head and neck
  abscesses were recognized in 7 and abscesses at atypical sites occurred i=
n 11.
  Inoculation by footpad scarification induced head and neck abscesses in 1=
 of 5
  swine and atypical sites abscesses in 2 of 5 swine. Intratracheal inocula=
tion
  produced head and neck abscesses in 3 of 5 swine and an abscess at an aty=
pical
  site (lung parenchyma) in 1 of the 3 with head and neck abscesses. Four o=
f 5
  noninoculated swine had abscesses in the mandibular lymph nodes 55 days a=
fter
  they had access to a manure pit used also by swine inoculated by foodpad
  scarification. Abscesses in atypical sites were not recognized in 29 sent=
inel
  swine with abscesses exposed by nose and/or oral contact. In transmission
  studies, all principal swine were inoculated with group E streptococcus b=
y the
  intraenteric route. A group of 5 principals transmitted the organism to 1=
 of 2
  susceptible penmates. Each of another 5 principals transmitted group E
  streptococcus to 4 of 5, 4 of 4, 3 of 4, 3 of 4, and 2 of 4 of their resp=
ective
  contact sentinels. In the last experiment, when 5 swine were inoculated a=

  penned separately, 2 of 2 transmitted group E streptococcus by drinking w=
ater,
  2 of 3 transmitted group E streptococcus by drinking water and/or nose co=
ntact,
  and 2 of 5 transmitted group E streptococcus by their faeces. Transmissio=
n was
  determined by isolation of group E streptococcus from sentinel abscess ex=
udate.
  In the last experiment, transmission also was determined by a microtitrat=

AB: The history and epidemiology of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), which in
  Europe was first observed in the USSR, is briefly reviewed. Although the
  disease was not certainly known in Italy, some human individuals in north=
ern
  Italy and some goats in central Italy were found in serological studies t=
o
  contain antibodies to TBE, and in 1975 2 patients in hospital in Florence=
 had
  acute symptoms of meningoencephalitis typical of TBE. Investigations were
  therefore begun in the Province of Firenze into the fauna, flora and clim=
ate of
  the region and into the possibility of isolating the virus from vectors o=
r
  reservoirs present there. The fauna consisted mainly of wild rodents but =
also
  included foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in both northern and southern sections of =
the
  study region. Ticks collected from both sections consisted of Rhipicephal=
us
  sanguineus (Latr.) R. bursa C. & F. and Ixodes ricinus (L.); the developm=
ent of
  the last species was favoured by the climate. In the northern section onl=
y, 2
  women and a fox were found positive for TBE, and antibodies were found in=
 20%
  of 1 of 3 flocks of sheep examined and also in a sentinel flock sent into=
 the
  same locality. In the southern section, antibodies to Bhanja virus (norma=
lly
  transmitted by Haemaphysalis punctata C. & F.) were found in indigenous s=
heep,
  but neither this virus nor TBE was found in sentinel sheep, wild animals =
or
  man. Examination of ticks from both sections showed that I. ricinus from =
the
  southern section contained Tribec virus (which had been isolated twice be=
fore
  in Italy and was also known in Romania and Slovakia). In the northern sec=
tion,
  females of I. ricinus from one locality contained TBE, the first strain t=
o be
  isolated from ticks in Italy, and 2 males of R. bursa in a different loca=
lity
  contained 2 strains of Bhanja virus. It is concluded that a natural focus=
 of
  TBE exists in the north of the Province of Firenze, with a second possibl=
e
  'risk' area, and that subclinical infections previously observed there we=
re
  probably due to TBE. The probable existence of foci of tick-borne Bhanja =
virus
  in the north and of Tribec virus in the south (although the indications a=
re not
  so definite) further demonstrate the necessity of continued surveillance =
and
  further investigation of tick-borne viruses in the Province of Firenze.

AB: A newly described flavivirus was responsible for a large encephalitis
  epidemic in Sao Paulo State, Brazil, in 1975-76. The aetiological agent, =
Rocio
  virus, was isolated from human patients and sentinel mice. The natural hi=
story
  of the virus is unknown although presumed to be arthropod-borne. Rocio vi=
rus
  was isolated from a single pool containing 19 individuals of Psorophora f=
erox
  (Humb.) out of 47 pools (283 specimens) of this species tested. The posit=
ive
  pool contained 16 empty, 2 gravid and 2 engorged mosquitoes. No isolation=
s were
  made from 2183 pools of other species. The positive pool was collected du=
ring
  the year of the epidemic at the same approximate time and place where
  vertebrate isolations were made.

  arboviruses were continued in 1980 [see RAE/B 69, 2081] by means both of
  serological tests of human and equine cases of suspected encephalitis and=
 of
  tests of mosquito pools for viruses. No cases of western equine encephali=
tis
  (WEE) or St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) were found in man in California, bu=
t 1
  case of SLE was found in Nevada. Of 25 equines tested serologically for W=
EE,
  only 2 cases were confirmed. A total of 3760 pools of mosquitoes (177 839
  individuals) was collected, of which most consisted either of Culex tarsa=
lis
  Coq. or of members of the species-complex of C. pipiens L.; 73 isolations=
 were
  made of WEE, 13 of SLE, 77 of Hart Park virus, 48 of Turlock virus and 11=
 of
  the California encephalitis group. Sentinel flocks of domestic fowls were
  distributed to 31 localities; 15% developed antibodies to WEE in the Sacr=
amento
  Valley, the San Joaquin Valley and southern California. These results
  demonstrated a substantial fall in the rates of infection with these mosq=
uito
  -borne viruses since 1979.

  of sentinel cattle; of these, 165 cross-reacted with D'Aguilar virus (an
  Australian Palyam group virus) in a complement fixation test. Neutralisat=

  tests were used to classify these viruses into 4 serotypes with the isola=
tes
  D'Aguilar B8112, CSIRO 11, CSIRO 58 and CSIRO 82 as the type strains. The
  latter 3 were new to Australia. Like other orbiviruses, these 4 serotypes=
 were
  partially sensitive to treatment with ether or chloroform. Neutralising
  antibodies against D'Aguilar, CSIRO 11 and CSIRO 58 viruses were detected=
 in
  sera from cattle, buffalo, deer and sheep but not man, horses, pigs or
  marsupials. Antibodies against CSIRO 82 virus were detected in 85% of 26
  buffalo and 0.4% of 495 cattle sera. The antibody distribution in Austral=
ia for
  D'Aguilar, CSIRO 11 and CSIRO 58 fell within the distribution limits of
  Culicoides brevitarsis Kieff., the insect from which these viruses were m=

AB: Following the final chemotherapy campaign of a 4-year programme, the
  biological assessment of transmission of S. mansoni was evaluated for 5 y=
ears.
  No infected Biomphalaria glabrata were found amongst 28 791 and 13 550 sn=
ails
  examined from flowing and static index sites, respectively. However, 89
  infected snails among 16 602 examined (0.54%) were found from additional =
sites.
  Sentinel snails examined between March 1974 and October 1977 revealed no
  infection and their use was discontinued. Following an increase in
  intransmission routine focal mollusciciding at 4-week intervals was intro=
duced
  in March 1980. The cost for 8 applications was US$641, representing a
  cost/caput of $0.21. These figures, extrapolated to a full year's control=
,
  become $1,042 and $0.35, respectively. The maximum cost was for the
  molluscicide, which absorbed 71.5% of the total. The data suggest that th=
e main
  transmission of S. mansoni occurs in the dry season, in flowing habitats,=
 as it
  does elsewhere in St. Lucia. [AS]

  virus from its nostrils when it farrowed 19 months later. This is the fir=
st
  direct observation of natural recrudescence of latent Aujeszky's virus
  infection [see VB 51, 88]. A strain of Aujeszky's virus isolated from the=
 brain
  of a newborn piglet which had presumably been infected transplacentally w=
as
  shown to be of lower pathogenicity than S62/26 strain, but was invasive a=
nd was
  shed after i/m inoculation, causing seroconversion in an in-contact senti=
nel
  pig. This virus is of importance in disease control schemes, as it may ca=
use
  silent seroconversion of herds without clinical disease. In a third exper=
iment,
  the establishment of a persistent infection of Aujeszky's virus in porcin=
e
  turbinate, salivary gland and tonsilar fragments maintained in vitro for =
up to
  126, 56 and 51 days, respectively, is described. The addition of antiseru=
m did
  not clear turbinate or salivary gland fragments of infection. On removal =
of
  antiserum, virus was shed and recovered for up to 189 and 182 days after
  initial infection, respectively.

AB: The hypothesis that increasing the probability of placing sterile males=

  increases sterile mating frequencies in the target population was tested =
in
  Veracruz (Mexico) by means of aerial releases of sterile flies during
  seasonally similar periods of 11 weeks in 1974 and 1975. Although the tot=
al
  numbers of flies released and the number of flies released per week were =
the
  same in both years, other release indices such as the number of pupae per
  release container, the dates of the releases and the distance between fli=
ght
  lanes of the distributing aircraft were different. Indigenous population
  densities and sterile mating frequencies were estimated by collection of =
eggs
  from wounds artificially infected on sentinel sheep. Sterile mating frequ=
encies
  averaged 10% in 1974 and 23.3% in 1975, the difference being highly
  significant, but the population size of C. hominivorax was about the same=
 in
  both years. Catches in traps baited with liver were mostly of released fe=
males
  and were significantly greater in 1975 than in 1974, indicating that ster=
ile
  fly placement was more effective in the second year. These data are consi=
stent

f
  sentinel cattle in herds located in many areas of Australia and in Papua =

  arboviruses from 1974. The best example of interaction between studies of
  arboviruses in sentinel cattle and vectors was Akabane virus and its susp=
ected
  vector, Culicoides brevitarsis Kieff., in Queensland and in one herd in t=
he
  centre of Australia; the infection occurred in cattle at the same time th=
at the
  virus was present in adults of C. brevitarsis collected nearby. The incid=

AB: A new member of the Simbu group of arboviruses, for which the name Peat=
on
  virus is proposed, was isolated from ceratopogonids and cattle in Austral=
ia.
  Nine isolates were obtained from 101 pools of Culicoides brevitarsis Kief=
f.
  Collected at Peachester, Queensland, between 30 November and 8 December 1=
976.
  Three isolations of the same virus were made from the blood of sentinel c=
attle
  collected at Grafton and Tamworth, New South Wales, on 20 January and 13 =
April
  1977, respectively. Peaton virus was shown to be a member of the Simbu gr=
oup by
  complement-fixation tests using antisera prepared against Australian stra=
ins of
  Akabane and Aino viruses. It was readily distinguishable from these virus=
es in
  cross-neutralisation tests in tissue cultures and mice. A serological sur=
vey of
  sentinel cattle showed that neutralising antibody was detectable only in =
cattle
  within the recorded limits of the suspected vector, C. brevitarsis.
  Neutralising antibody in blood serum was detected in 22 of 157 sheep, 21 =
of 137
  horses, 7 of 18 buffaloes, 7 of 20 goats and 3 of 62 pigs, but not in 22
  camels, 34 dogs, 3 cats, 76 human beings, 240 marsupials, 19 reptiles or =
31
  wild birds. The Yale Arbovirus Research Unit and the Center for Disease
  Control, Fort Collins, USA, found that Peaton virus was distinguishable f=
rom
  all other Simbu group viruses and thus is a new virus.

  epizootic cycle. Attempts were made to isolate the virus from mosquitoes
  collected in 3 light-traps operated twice a week at three sentinel pigpen=
s in
  the Taipei area from May to October 1978. A total of 6549 mosquitoes trap=
ped
  alive was processed in 283 pools. Suspensions were inoculated into cell
  cultures of Aedes albopictus (Skuse) and into suckling mice. A total of 1=
9
  isolations of Japanese encephalitis virus were made; 12 from pools of Cul=
ex
  tritaeniorhynchus Giles, 6 from C. vishnui Theo. (annulus Theo.) and 1 fr=
om C.
  quinquefasciatus Say. Sindbis virus was isolated for the first time in Ta=
iwan
  from a pool of C. tritaeniorhynchus. More isolates were obtained via mosq=
uito
  cell cultures than by mouse inoculation. Positive isolations of Japanese
  encephalitis virus by mouse inoculation were all from the mosquitoes coll=
ected
  during the period between 20 and 30 June, when all 6 sentinel pigs were
  viraemic.

  sentinel animals for pathogens must continue to be included in surveillan=

  systems, since the 2 methods differ in specificity and sensitivity and

AB: In view of the effectiveness of Romanomermis culicivorax in controlling

leases
  of the postparasitic stage were made at Riverside in California in 1977 a=
nd
  1978 to determine the recycling time and the ability of nematode populati=
ons to
  persist without further supplementation; infective populations were asses=
sed by
  daily exposure of sentinel larvae of Culex pipiens L. or Anopheles freebo=
rni
  Aitken, but the mosquitoes were not allowed to breed. Production of infec=
tive
  stages was lower in 1978 than in 1979, but the ability of the nematode to
  persist for at least 15 months through 2 mosquito seasons was demonstrate=
d;
  this was largely due to variable development rates that in turn probably
  depended on genetic heterogeneity within the nematode population. Althoug=
h the
  optimum average temperature for the development of the postparasitic stag=
e was
  27 deg C, R. culicivorax was able to overwinter in California and resumed
  activity in the preparasitic stage when the soil temperature reached 12-1=
3 deg
  C. It is suggested that R. culicivorax might be used to prevent reinfesta=
tion
  of areas from which mosquitoes had been eradicated.

 with
  La Crosse (LAC) virus was demonstrated. One isolate of the virus was obta=

  red fox was above the threshold of infection for Aedes triseriatus (Say).
  Antibody responses were measured by the microneutralisation test employin=
g 4
  California group viruses: LAC, snowshoe hare, Trivittatus and Jamestown C=
anyon.
  Four of 6 sentinel red foxes developed LAC virus neutralising antibody.
  Antibody titres peaked between days 7 and 34 and were still detectable by=
 day
  345 after infection. Homologous LAC virus antibody titres were consistent=
ly 4
  -fold or more greater than heterologous titres. Serological evidence for
  natural LAC virus infection was demonstrated in 33 of 57 (58%) free-rangi=
ng red
  foxes, 18 of 32 (57%) gray foxes, and 4 of 16 (25%) racoons. Antibody tit=
res
  were comparaable in free-ranging foxes infected naturally and those infec=
ted
  experimentally by mosquito bite. The prevalence of infection was signific=
antly
  different (P < 0.001) for foxes trapped in 3 distinct areas within the en=

AB: In the Marquis Valley area of St. Lucia in 1973 a single injection of
  hycanthone (2.5 mg/kg body-weight) was offered to all people found infect=
ed
  with Schistosoma mansoni. Of 677 treated, 22.8% vomited during the first =
24 h
  but 44.5% had no side effects. Of 160 people found infected in late 1974,=
 only
  5 were verified treatment failures. Of the 141 apparently new infections,=
 103
  had had a positive faecal examination in 1971 or 1972 and probably repres=
ented
  old, light infections. Of the 38 positive for the first time in 1974, onl=
y 14
  were less than 15 years old. Of 156 people treated in 1974, 21.2% vomited=
. The
  over-all reduction in prevalence was from 25% in 1973 to 7% in 1974. Ther=
e was
  a significant reduction in incidence of new infections. The community egg
  excretion, or contamination potential was reduced by 63%. No naturally in=
fected
  snails have been found in the area since chemotherapy started and sentine=
l
  snails have not become infected. The cost/person protected in the control
  scheme area was $1.34 in the first year and $0.81 in the 2nd.

AB: In St. Lucia, 5 settlements were provided with on-premises water for ea=

  household and with 5 public laundry-shower units and 3 swimming pools, so=
 as to
  discourage contact with snail-infected water. Another 6 settlements on th=
e
  northern side of the same valley had only a stand-pipe water system. Over=
 4
  years (1970-74) the incidence of new cases of schistosomiasis in children=
 aged
  up to 10 years fell from 31 to 14% in the water-supply area, whereas in t=
he
  other area it rose from 24 to 29%. The provision of water-supply faciliti=
es was
  also associated with substantial reductions in the prevalence and intensi=
ty of
  the infection in children (0 to 14 years) and with reductions in the infe=
ction
  rates of sentinel snails exposed to natural waters in the area.

AB: A long-term controlled field experiment for the control of Schistosoma
  mansoni in Pernambuco State, northeastern Brazil, is described. Applicati=
on of
  the molluscide Bayluscide was the only measure used. All standing and run=
ning
  waters were treated 3 times during the first operational year (1968) and
  thereafter (monthly until December 1974) focal applications were made whe=
re
  snails were found. The mollusciciding reduced all the parameters used for
  evaluating the disease (up to 1974) : incidence, prevalence, faecal egg c=
ounts,
  snail populations (dynamics and infection rate) and the infectivity of na=
tural
  water bodies (as measured by the exposure on sentinel mice). Less pronoun=
ced
  reductions in these parameters occurred in the untreated control area. De=
spite
  the benefits of the mollusciciding, there was no evidence that transmissi=
on had
  been interrupted and prevalence and incidence rates tended to stabilize a=
fter
  1972. The total cost of the project was US$ 381 181, most (80.8%) going t=
o
  local labour; the average annual cost per capita was US$ 7.4.

nd
  body weight changes in sentinel birds after exposure to litter were used =
to
  estimate coccidial infections. The inclusion of medicated groups of senti=
nel
  birds was used to test the efficacy of anticoccidial drugs on naturally
  acquired coccidial infections arising from exposure to commercial broiler=
 house
  litter. The coccidial challenge of reused commercial broiler house litter=
 was
  compared with litter new at the start of the crop. Only slightly higher
  coccidial challenge resulted from the reuse of litter. Oocyst counts were
  relatively high in litter from experimental pens and there was some corre=
lation
  between numbers of oocysts found in the litter and infection acquired by
  sentinel birds. Conversely, the coccidial infections acquired by sentinel=
 birds
  exposed to commercial broiler house litter did not correlate with the num=
ber of
  oocysts found in the litter to which they had been exposed. This indicate=
s that
  litter oocyst counts are a relatively insensitive method for predicting
  potential coccidial challenges in broiler chickens [see also VB 50, abst.=

 Notes

  and on the effect of climatic conditions on its flight; it was most abund=

  20 deg C or humidities below 90% RH. Host preferences were found to chang=

  abruptly from birds to mammals in May or June and back to birds in Decemb=
er.
  Epidemiological tendencies that were beginning to emerge and give cause f=
or
  concern as a result of a state-wide surveillance system operating in 1978=
 are
  outlined, including sentinel chickens and mammalian sera found positive f=

e
  necessity for maintaining the surveillance programme at a level comparabl=

AB: In this review of the past and future research work of the Department o=
f
  Biomedical and Environmental Health Sciences, California University, on
  mosquito-borne encephalitis viruses, attention is drawn to the drastic
  reduction of populations of Culex tarsalis Coq. and Aedes melanimon Dyar =
and
  therefore of the incidence of western equine encephalitis (WEE) and St. L=
ouis
  encephalitis (SLE), which led to the direction of department research tow=
ards
  vector competence, vector genetics and statistical models of variable fac=
tors
  affecting the control of vectors, rather than towards actual control meas=
ures.
  Attention is also drawn to the resurgence of C. tarsalis in 1978, as indi=
cated
  by light-trap catches in the California Imperial Valley and by the incide=
nce of
  WEE in flocks of sentinel chickens, and the number of human encephalitis =
cases
  likely to occur in the next few years is deduced. In view of the unexpect=
ed
  official limiting of state funds available for mosquito control, the
  possibility of an incidence of encephalitis at rates comparable to those =
of the
  1950s must be envisaged, and the author recommends that a large proportio=
n of
  the limited funds now available should be used for a selective programme =
of
  control, not against the larvae as in the past, but against the older adu=
lt
  females of C. tarsalis that are current or potential vectors of encephali=
tis
  viruses, in order to break the transmission cycle as rapidly as possible.

AB: The progress of populations of Cochliomyia hominivorax (Coquerel) was
  followed continuously from May 1974 to September 1975 in northern Veracru=
z,
  Mexico, by means of observations on oviposition in artificially inflicted
  wounds on sentinel sheep distributed among 9-13 sampling locations, and
  estimates resulting from mathematical calculations based on the results o=
f
  these observations were made regarding oviposition and population dynamic=
s. A
  weekly arithmetical means of 3.68 egg-masses/sampling site was estimated =
for
  the study period of 73 weeks. Oviposition rates were maximal in May-June =
and
  minimal in November-February. The spatially and temporally clustered patt=
ern of
  oviposition, and the census data from 2 pairs of adjacent sampling sites,
  confirmed the previous hypothesis of highly localised mating and oviposit=
ion.
  Estimates of adult survival and oviposition schedules permitted the
  establishment of a presumptive relationship between adult female density =
and
  the resulting oviposition density. In the cool months (November-March), 3=
-6% of
  hypothetically stable populations oviposited daily, and in the warm month=
s (May
  -October), 10-16% did so. The average oviposition density during the cool
  season was about one-quarter of that of the warm season. After correction=
 for
  the effects of temperature on oviposition frequency and life expectancy, =
the
  number of egg-masses laid during the cool season was found to have been
  presumptively generated by 2-4 times the number of adults producing an eq=
ual
  number of eggs in the warm season; the average adult density in the cool =
season
  then became approximately one-half that of the warm-season population. Th=
e
  implications of this discovery for the timing and success of sterile-adul=
t
  releases for control are discussed.

976. A
  virus was isolated from central nervous system (CNS) tissues of a 39-year=

rus
  for which the name Rocio virus is proposed. Nine further isolations of Ro=
cio
  virus were obtained from CNS tissues of 17 patients who died with clinica=
l
  symptoms of encephalitis. Isolation of virus and serological evidence of =
Rocio
  virus infection in a significant proportion of the encephalitis patients
  suggested that Rocio virus was the aetiological agent of the epidemic. Ro=
cio
  virus was isolated only from patients who died within 5 days of onset of
  illness. The virus was also isolated from two sentinel mice exposed to bl=
ood
  -sucking insects in the epidemic zone and from a rufous collared sparrow
  (Zonotrichia capensis) collected in the area.

ion on
  the Delaware-Maryland-Virginia (DelMarVa) Peninsula. Rabbits were bled we=

  and their sera were tested for the presence of neutralising antibody to b=
oth
  Keystone and Jamestown Canyon viruses. Adult mosquito activity was monito=
red
  concurrently by CDC miniature light-traps with dry ice. Of 100 rabbits ex=
posed,
  20 acquired neutralising antibody to Keystone virus as a result of their
  exposure; none acquired antibody to Jamestown Canyon virus. Eighty-three
  percent of the susceptible rabbits exposed converted immediately after th=
e
  emergence of adults of Aedes atlanticus D. & K. in early September. Rabbi=
ts
  seroconversions were not limited to any particular habitat within the swa=
mp.
  The conversion of a large proportion of sentinel rabbits immediately foll=
owing
  emergence of A. atlanticus and the previous demonstration of transovarial
  transmission of Keystone virus by A. atlanticus suggest that vertically
  infected individuals are capable of viral transmission at their initial
  engorgement. Such transmission provides the initial step in a vertebrate
  amplification cycle.

  isolations from indigenous and sentinel mosquito larvae in the site that =

  levels were observed in 1975 and in the first part of 1976 until an abnor=

  dry period, during which the fungus was lost. Another experiment in 1975-=
76
  indicated that the fungus could survive the land-management practices
  associated with rice-fields [see preceding abstract but 3]. It was conclu=
ded
  that L. giganteum is a highly infectious pathogen of the larvae of Culex
  tarsalis Coq. and can survive normal seasonal droughts and land-managemen=
t
  practices; it was not however possible to test the theory that fungus sur=
vival
  is limited by high water temperatures or salinity.

AB: Tonate and Cabassou viruses, which are 2 arboviruses of the Venezuelan
  equine encephalitis (VEE) complex, were frequently isolated from mosquito=
es,
  from sentinel infant mice and from wild vertebrates in French Guiana in 1=
973
  -77. Using these data and comparing them with the results of previous wor=
k
  cited in the literature, a study was made of the epidemiology of these vi=
ruses
  with reference to the biology of these vectors. Of the 16 species of Culi=
cidae
  and a few of Phlebotominae that were found to harbour one or both of the
  viruses, the species most commonly infected were found to be Culex portes=
i
  Senevet & Abonnenc and, to a lesser extent, Coquillettidia venezuelensis
  (Theo.).The activity cycles, seasonal variations in density and populatio=
n age
  in relation to the biting activity and vector potential of these species,
  especially Culex portesi, are examined in detail, and conclusions are dra=
wn on
  the hypothetical epidemiological cycle of the viruses. Both mosquito spec=
ies
  were mainly nocturnal [see RAE/B 67, 832] and therefore active at the tim=
e that
  rodents and marsupials were becoming active, while birds (the other verte=
brates
  from which these viruses were isolated) were already roosting. The season=
al
  incidence of the mosquitoes appeared to vary according to rainfall and to=
 its
  effect on the larval habitats (small semi-permanent pools for Culex, aqua=
tic
  plants in permanent marshes for Coquillettidia); a monthly rainfall of 15=
0-350
  mm was favourable. Sudden cessation of the rains in July-August 1976 resu=
lted
  in outbreaks of both species, which were terminated by 2.5 months of drou=
ght
  until October. It was noted however that virus incidence, especially in C=
.
  venezuelensis, did not always correspond with high population density.The
  physiological age of Culex females influenced their biting cycle but this=
 did
  not necessarily affect virus transmission. The proportion of parous femal=
es was
  related to the population dynamics, which in turn were related to rainfal=
l; in
  favourable conditions, over 90% of the Culex females caught were parous,
  whereas the proportion of parous Coquillettidia females never seemed grea=
ter
  than 60%. The epidemiology of the viruses appeared to consist of 2 transm=
ission
  cycles, alternating according to the season; the first, an epizootic cycl=
e
  mainly on mammals at the beginning of the rainy season or beginning of th=
e dry
  season, when dense populations of Culex portesi, with a high proportion o=
f
  parous females, were present, followed by a second, an enzootic cycle mai=
nly on
  birds during the middle and end of the rainy season and during the dry se=
ason,
  when populations of C. portesi were low with a low proportion of parous f=
emales.

AB: The population dynamics of Cochliomyia hominivorax (Coquerel) were
  investigated in May-October 1974 in 3 plots of 5180 km2 each in Mexico, o=
f
  which 2 plots were in the semi-arid barrier zone of Tamaulipas and the th=
ird
  further south in equable humid Veracruz in which sterile adult flies had =
not
  been previously released. Sterile adults were released at a weekly rate o=
f 386
  flies/km2 into these plots, the currently mass-produced strain Tex-Mex in
  Veracruz and in the more northern Tamaulipas plot and a newly synthesised
  strain, FF8, in the southern Tamaulipas plot. Population size and frequen=
cy of
  sterile matings were deduced from the number and fertility of eggs collec=
ted
  daily from wounds in sentinel sheep. Populations were largest in humid
  conditions and smallest in drought periods and were highly aggregated and
  transient. The distribution of eggs in time and space was very variable i=
n the
  barrier zone, indicating instability in the population, whereas the popul=
ations
  at Veracruz were relatively homogeneous and stable. Sterile matings were =
less
  frequent in previously untreated populations of Veracruz than in populati=
ons of
  the barrier zone where sterile adults had often been released previously,=
 which
  contradicts the hypothesis of some authors that laboratory-reared sterile
  adults were less competitive sexually or that a sexual discrimination aga=
inst
  these released adults had evolved among wild populations of the barrier z=
one.
  No significant difference in the frequency of sterile mating was observed
  between populations treated with the Tex-Mex and the FF8 strains. Factors
  governing population size and dynamics of C. hominivorax are discussed, o=
f
  which climate appears to be the most important; in particular, hot dry wi=
nds
  causing heat stress and desiccation appeared to affect wild and released
  populations equally and had indirect effects such as drying the soil (mak=
ing it
  unfavourable to wandering larvae and to pupae) and drying open wounds in =
sheep
  (making them unsuitable for oviposition).

AB: Epidemiological studies on cattle in the Cauca River Valley and the Atl=
antic
  Coast of Colombia indicated that T. vivax infection was endemic in the wh=
ole of
  the Cauca Valley, and that Anaplasma and Babesia infections on the same f=
arms
  may have obscured the diagnosis of clinical bovine trypanosomiasis. The
  haematocrit centrifuge technique and the direct fluorescent antibody tech=
nique
  were used as standard diagnostic methods. It was shown that movement of
  infected cattle could initiate clinical outbreaks in susceptible cattle
  populations and that T. vivax challenge varied from year to year,allowing
  susceptible cattle to appear within the endemic area. The use of two sent=
inel
  herds of cattle suggested the possibility of one herd serving as a reserv=
oir of
  infection. Field outbreaks of T. vivax infections were controlled using
  diminazene at 7 mg/kg body weight. Losses measured in an outbreak on a si=
ngle
  dairy farm of 179 cows and followers totalled US$5646. Prevalence of infe=
ction
  in herds in the Cauca Valley appeared similar to that in endemic areas in
  Africa.

AB: The purpose of this report is to describe isolations of Venezuelan (VEE=
) and
  eastern (EEE) equine encephalitis virus made in the lowland moist tropica=
l
  forest of the Catatumbo region on the south-western part of the State of =
Zulia,
  Venezuela. Culex declarator D. & K., C. dunni Dyar and species of the sub=
genus
  Melanoconion of Culex were the most abundant mosquitoes present, and
  Phlebotomus spp. were also found. Four strains of VEE virus were isolated=
 from
  sentinel hamsters exposed at Cano Mocho and Madre Vieja sites in 1973 and=
 1974,
  and three strains of EEE virus in Hacienda (Hda.) Las Nubes in 1975. Both
  viruses were recovered during silent interepidemic periods, and it is bel=
ieved
  that these viruses are maintained in this region in sylvatic conditions. =
The
  recovered virus strains were detected within 24 to 48 h, both in SMB and =
Vero
  Cell monolayer cultures, and the sentinel hamsters yielded virus infectiv=
ities
  up to 104 PFU ml. The VEE isolate (IVIC PAn 23645-47), recovered during t=
he
  silent interepizodemic period had an elution profile on the hydroxylapati=
te
  column corresponding to that of a I-D (VEEV-3880) or a I-E (VEEV-63A216)
  'enzootic' subtype. However, considering other in vitro criteria (KHI; HA=
 pH
  5.8-6.0; small plaque size in Vero monolayers with suitable overlay media=
),
  this latter and other previous isolates had some very distinct properties=
 of
  the 'epizootic' strains. Thus, the evidence suggests that in Venezuela th=
e VEE
  virus cycle in nature is maintained either by the so called 'enzootic' an=
d/or
  'epizootic' virus types, or the virus population of the isolates have
  particular in vitro properties which do not correlate to the virulence ma=
rkers
  in vivo. It is considered that this important question must be further
  clarified, and in addition, the isolation of three strains of EEE are rep=
orted;
  this is the first report of the presence of this virus in Venezuela. Alth=
ough
  the EEE isolates may be of the South American type, they must be consider=
ed as
  potentially dangerous.

  diseases in Belgium. Massive trypanosome infections are observed in susce=
ptible
  tourists and sportsmen after visits to national parks and safari areas of=
 East,
  Central and Southern Africa. The patients have often been exposed to the
  vectors, Glossina spp., for only a few hours, so it is easy to determine =
the
  day, and even in some cases the hour, of the infective bite. The subjects=
 are
  without any immunological competence and so constitute an unusual type of
  sentinel host. The vectors may carry a zoonosis from game that is poorly
  adapted to man or may transmit heavy infections that were collected from =
park
  wardens who act as carriers. The course of the disease is so critical tha=
t it
  has become an urgent problem. Specific treatment needs to be planned very
  carefully and individually if disastrous, and even fatal, reactions are t=
o be
  avoided.

n of
  the crab's mode of locomotion on the ground and on the palms, especially =
when

AB: The relative effectiveness of 2 sterile-fly release methods was tested =
in
  1975-76 against natural populations of Cochliomyia hominivorax (Coquerel)=
 in
  southern Texas. The first method consisted of weekly releases of 477-681
  flies/km2, distributed in units of 400, from parallel flight lanes 2 km a=
part;
  this treatment was experimental. The other method consisted of weekly rel=
eases
  of 2574 flies/km2, distributed in units of 2000, from lanes 8 km apart, w=
hich
  was the standard method of treatment in 1968-77. Collection of egg-masses=
 from
  wounded sentinel sheep showed that sterile mating frequency was greatest =
in the
  area where the experimental method had been applied, although the geometr=
ic
  mean egg densities were similar in both areas. This was confirmed by the
  significantly lower incidence in reported cases of attack in the experime=
ntal
  than in the standard-treatment area. A threefold increase in case inciden=
ce was
  however reported in the experimental zone when large fly containers were
  substituted for small ones, flight lanes were widened and the numbers of
  sterile flies released were increased in that zone; case incidence was on=
ly
  slightly increased during that period in untreated areas. The test result=
s are
  hypothetically explained by a missile-target analogy and by the dispersal
  behaviour of sterile males after release. Since the test results were aff=
ected
  in 1976 by the worst epizootic of C. hominivorax since 1972, some phenome=
na
  underlying the outbreak are described; highly fertile overwintering popul=
ations
  are suggested as the primary causal factor.

  in the availability of eggs within 30 m of deposition by dogs infected wi=
th
  Taenia hydatigena. In the first trial, the experimental pasture was divid=
ed
  into 9 equal plots; in the 2nd trial, each of the 9 plots was divided int=
o sub
  -plots. In each trial, infected dogs were placed on the pasture for 10 da=
ys.
  Lambs were then grazed for 10 days immediately, 36 days and 56 days after=
 the
  dogs had been removed. Changes in the dispersion pattern of the eggs over=
 time
  and space were assessed by examination of the lambs for cysts at autopsy.=
 In
  both trials, eggs spread radially within the grazing zone within 10 days,=
 but
  36 days after the removal of the dogs, their availability to the lambs wa=
s
  markedly reduced. In the first trial at 5 weeks, the height of grass (bet=
ween 2
  cm and 15 cm) did not modify egg availability. In both trials, despite
  differences in rainfall affecting the growth of grass and associated fact=
ors
  similar egg losses occurred. [AS]

  transmit yellow fever has been in progress since 1946 in the Zika Forest =
near
  Entebbe in Uganda. In 1972, during one of these studies, the first strain=
 of
  yellow fever virus was isolated from the Entebbe area; a further 17 strai=
ns
  were isolated from Aedes africanus (Theo.) collected from the Zika and Si=
sa
  Forests and 1 strain was isolated from Coquillettidia fuscopennata (Theo.=
),
  also from the Zika Forest. Out of 4 non-immune rhesus monkeys kept as sen=
tinel
  animals in the Zika Forest in 1972 at the time of the collection, of the
  infective mosquitoes, 3 died of yellow fever. These observations indicate=
 that
  the disease is still present in Africa and therefore remains a potential =
menace
  to man. The epidemiological implications are discussed.

AB: A total of 1140 five-week-old commercial broiler chickens of the Cobb
  strain, reared indoors, were used as sentinel birds in the summer of 1975=
 in
  Manitoba. During the exposure period the birds were supplied with unrestr=
icted
  food and water, and clopidol was added to the ration at 0.0125% to contro=
l
  leukocytozoonosis and coccidiosis. The cage design is described and
  illustrated. After every two-week exposure period, each batch of chickens=
 was
  replaced by a new serologically negative batch, and HI tests were carried=
 out
  on the exposed chickens. The use of sentinel flocks proved to be extremel=
y
  useful for assessing the public health hazard of Western encephalomyeliti=
s and
  for providing data for decisions on the timing, location and extent of co=
ntrol
  measures, when combined with mosquito studies and the reporting of equine=
 cases.

AB: Two sentinel flocks each of 50 ewes with no serum neutralizing antibodi=
es
  against Akabane virus have been maintained since late 1974. Blood samples=
 taken
  at monthly intervals were tested in New South Wales for the appearance of
  specific neutralizing antibodies. Between February and April 1976 a high
  proportion of the ewes in each flock developed neutralizing antibodies. T=
welve
  positive ewes which mated in February were slaughtered and examined. Nine=
 of
  them were pregnant. Of the fetuses (at 72-89 days' gestation) one was
  mummified, one had arthrogryposis/hydranencephaly and the remaining seven
  appeared normal. None of the fetuses had serum neutralization antibodies
  against Akabane virus but the virus was isolated from the abnormal fetus =
and
  from one apparently normal one. Cross neutralization tests to compare the=
se
  isolates with a reference strain revealed no antigenic differences. It is
  therefore concluded that an Akabane virus strain B 8935 isolated from
  Culicoides brevitarsis which has been demonstrated to cause congenital
  deformities in lambs when ewes were experimentally infected at 36 days'
  gestation, is antigenically identical with two isolates from field tests =
on
  ovine fetuses.

  2.3 m above a group of 10 infected donor pigs also developed ASF. Of thre=

at an
  earlier stage of incubation did not become infected, but all those expose=
d for
  48 h to donor pigs in the later stages of acute disease became infected. =
After
  exposure for only 24 h, pigs did not develop ASF. The clinical signs in
  recipient and donor pigs were indistinguishable. Airborne virus was not
  detected by either biological or mechanical sampling procedures. The sour=
ce of
  airborne virus was not determined. The failure of ASF virus to spread to
  sentinel control pigs housed in adjacent loose-boxes and other loose-boxe=
s in

AB: Studies on the incidence of eastern equine encephalitis virus were star=
ted
  in 1961 at 3 field stations in forested areas near the city of Sao Paulo,
  Brazil. The virus was isolated in 1969-71 from various resident birds and=
 from
  Oryzomys and Didelphis marsupialis and sentinel mice, and once, in 1970, =
from a
  pool of Phoniomyia pilicauda (Root). This was the first isolation of this=
 virus
  from mosquitos in southern Brazil. It is not thought that P. pilicauda ca=
n be
  involved in epizootics as it is a forest species and the epizootics occur=
red in
  open country. Isolations of the virus were made at all seasons. None was =
made
  after 1971. No epizootic in horses has been reported in Sao Paulo since 1=
966.
  It is assumed that the virus is not endemic in the region as no evidence =
of
  overt illness in man was seen, although there was serological evidence of
  infection.

AB: Ecological studies on Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus in a m=
arsh
  habitat near the epicentre of the 1969 outbreak in Guatemala revealed tha=
t the
  virus was enzootic there. The virus was isolated yearly in 1968-1973 from
  sentinel hamsters exposed during the rainy seasons, and from mosquitoes
  collected during July and August 1979. Hamsters yielded 41 strains of VEE
  virus, and virus was detected within 2 km of the edge of the marsh, in it=
s
  interior, and at its western extreme 18 km from the central study site at=
 La
  Avellana. One strain of virus came from a hamster that died in the dry se=
ason
  of January 1970. Species of Culex yielded 20 strains of VEE virus and spe=
cies
  of Mansonia and Aedes one each. Species of the subgenus Melanoconion of C=
ulex
  and Aedes taeniorhynchus (Wied.) were most prevalent near the
  marsh.Haemagglutination-inhibition and neutralisation antibody tests show=
ed
  that wild terrestrial mammals (opossums and rodents), man and dogs, but n=
ot
  wild birds, were frequently infected. Seven of 16 susceptible residents o=
f
  villages at the edge of the marsh developed antibodies without symptoms d=
uring
  an 18-month period between September 1971 and february 1973. Only 1 of 5
  sentinel rabbits, and none of 30 sentinel chickens developed antibody to =
VEE
  during August-September 1971 when virus activity was readily detected by =
the
  use of sentinel hamsters. Five strains of group C arboviruses (one identi=
fied
  as Nepuyo) were recovered from sentinel hamsters in 1968-70, and one stra=
in of
  Nepuyo virus was isolated from the blood of a person with a febrile illne=
ss
  during 1972. Two strains of Patois group arboviruses were isolated from s=
pecies
  of Culex during 1970.

AB: Three strains of Banzi virus, 54 of Germiston virus and 55 of Witwaters=
rand
  virus were isolated from hamsters exposed as virus sentinels at 2 localit=
ies
  (Port Shepstone and Lake Insese) in Natal, South Africa, and 1 in central
  Mozambique [cf. preceding abstract]. Five surviving hamsters had antibodi=
es to
  Banzi virus and 1 to Germiston virus. Infection frequencies per 100 hamst=
er
  -days of exposure varied from 0.17 to 7.7 with Germiston virus and from 0=
.17 to
  8.4 with Witwatersrand virus. It seemed likely that recorded infection
  frequencies of Banzi virus were not representative of actual infections b=
ecause
  of mortality among Banzi-infected hamsters caused by Germiston and
  Witwatersrand viruses. At both study sites in South Africa, the hamsters =
were
  exposed in areas where Culex rubinotus Theo. was shown at the time to be
  infected with the same viruses, and it is concluded that C. rubinotus was=
 the
  cause of the infections in the hamster. In Mozambique, some infections in
  hamsters occurred during the dry season. One strain of Banzi virus was is=
olated
  from Praomys natalensis from Mozambique. Two sera from P. natalensis from=
 South
  Africa contained antibodies to Banzi virus and another 2 sera had antibod=
ies to
  Witwatersrand virus. It is concluded that wild rodents are the vertebrate
  maintenance hosts of these viruses.

AB: A virus surveillance project was established and maintained during 1972
  along 10 major river drainages in Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Oklahoma=
,
  Texas and Louisiana. Mosquitoes and ceratopogonids were collected in CDC =
light
  -traps and blood specimens from sentinel equines during 83 visits to 141
  arthropod collecting sites and 22 sentinel locations from April-December =
1972.
  A total of 173 074 mosquitoes was tested, and 303 arboviruses were isolat=
ed
  from 11 of 41 species; 227 of the isolations were from Culex tarsalis Coq=
., the
  most abundant species. From 13 388 ceratopogonids tested, 8 arbovirus
  isolations were obtained from 1 of 5 species (Culicoides variipennis (Coq=
.)).
  There was no isolation of Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus. Wes=
tern
  equine encephalitis (WEE) virus isolates were the most numerous and were
  followed by Turlock, St. Louis encephalitis, Hart Park, California
  encephalitis, and Bunyamwera group viruses. The first isolation of WEE fr=
om the
  mosquito Culex erraticus (D. & K.) is reported, as is the extension of th=
e
  ranges for Buttonwillow virus from California to New Mexico and Texas. Al=
so, a
  single isolation of the Bunyamwera group from Culicoides variipennis exte=
nds
  the range of this virus-vector relationship from California to Texas. New
  distribution records for mosquito species previously unknown in Arizona,
  Louisiana, New Mexico, and Oklahoma are reported. The sentinel burros det=
ected
  WEE serological conversions at two sites in New Mexico and at one in Texa=
s. The
  surveillance project provided current information on the status of arbovi=
rus
  activity, including the absence of VEE activity during 1972, and it
  demonstrated the existence of the potential for WEE epizootics and epidem=
ics
  throughout a wide geographical area of the western United States.

e the
  prevalence rate of California-group virus antibodies in sera of several
  vertebrate species. Serum samples were tested for neutralising antibody i=
n a
  microneutralisation system with baby hamster kidney cell culture. Of 77 s=
era
  tested, 21 neutralised Trivittatus virus. The antibody prevalence rate wa=
s
  highest for eastern cottontail rabbits inasmuch as 10 of 22 serum samples=
 from
  this species exhibited neutralising activity. Other vertebrate species ha=
ving
  Trivittatus virus antibody included the fox squirrel (7 of 24), opossum (=
3 of
  25) and raccoon (1 of 6). One serum sample from cottontail rabbit neutral=
ised
  both Trivittatus and Jamestown Canyon viruses, and one serum sample from
  opossum neutralised Jamestown Canyon virus. None of the vertebrate sera
  neutralised La Crosse, St. Louis encephalitis or western equine encephali=

  viruses. Trivittatus virus neutralising antibody was detected in the sera=
 of
  sentinel rabbits, and the virus was isolated from the blood collected fro=

  of these sentinels shortly after the first population peak of adults of A=

  geographically progressive manner inland from an enzootic marsh focus of =
virus
  on the Pacific coast of south-eastern Guatemala [cf. preceding abstract].
  During the wet seasons of 1972 and 1973, VEE virus was detected by sentin=
el
  horses (and a sentinel hamster in 1972) in a small wood 10 km north of th=
e
  marsh, but the virus was undetectable there during the dry seasons of 197=
3 and
  1974 and the wet season of 1974. Species of the subgenus Melanoconion of =
Culex
  were found in this wood and at the marsh during August 1973. These observ=
ations
  are compatible with movement of VEE virus from the marsh habitat during s=
ome
  wet seasons. However, virus activity in this region adjacent to the marsh=
 was
  quantitatively unpredictable on a yearly basis and occurred in only very =
focal
  habitats in 1971-74. The mechanisms of VEE virus movement from the marsh =
are
  currently unknown, but bats are under study as a likely possibility.

  Japanese encephalitis virus between 1969 and 1973 in a rural area of nort=
hern
  Taiwan with a high annual incidence of human cases. The study site includ=
ed a
  farmyard, schools, a bat cave, rice-fields and a heronry. Although Culex
  vishnui Theo. (annulus Theo.) was collected in every month of the year,
  isolations were made only in midsummer and only from C. vishnui (17 isola=
tions)
  and C. tritaeniorhynchus Giles (one). These isolates were usually collect=
ed
  from pigs. In each year, cases in man near the study site were reported 3=
 to 5
  weeks after the initial isolations from sentinel pigs. Isolations were ma=
de
  only for 4 to 8 weeks each summer. The isolation of the virus was not rel=
ated
  to the availability of susceptible pigs or the spring or summer peaks in
  prevalence of C. vishnui. Despite periodic draining of rice-fields and th=
e
  application of insecticides, sufficient numbers of C. vishnui were availa=
ble to
  support transmission of the virus in each year of the study.

AB: Evidence was sought in 1970-75 of persistence of Venezuelan equine
  encephalitis (VEE) virus in regions of Central America that were heavily
  involved in the epidemic and equine epizootic of 1969. Four sentinel hors=
es
  were exposed in an arid, upland region of the Atlantic drainage of Guatem=
ala in
  August-October 1970, but none became infected. The epicentre region of th=
e 1969
  outbreak, in south-eastern Guatemala and south-western El Salvador, was s=
tudied
  from July 1970 to February 1974; no antibody developed in sentinel horses=
,
  sentinel hamsters did not die, mosquitoes yielded no virus and wild rats =
had no
  detectable antibody to VEE virus. Unexplained decreases in populations of=
 wild
  terrestrial mammals possibly limited the maintenance of the virus. Howeve=
r,
  mosquitoes (particularly species of Culex) were plentiful and present in =
the
  same species composition found at a focus of enzootic VEE virus about 35 =
km
  north-west of the epicentre region. In studies at two Guatemalan ranches =
near
  the epicentre, where horses died in 1969, VEE virus was isolated from sen=
tinel
  horses along one of three lakes on one ranch during the wet season of 197=
2 but
  not during the dry or wet seasons of 1973; the titres of neutralising
  antibodies in these 4 horses were higher against an enzootic strain of VE=
E
  virus than against an epizootic strain. In 1970 and 1971, VEE virus was
  isolated from sentinel hamsters exposed at a marsh on the other ranch, bu=
t Vero
  plaque characteristics were those of enzootic VEE virus. The only epizoot=
ic
  activity of VEE virus discovered in Central America in 1970-1975 occurred=
 in
  Nicaragua between April and June 1972. Several hundred horses died, and
  neutralising antibody, like that engendered by epizootic virus, was found=
 in 2
  young, unvaccinated horses. Whether this represented persistence of epizo=
otic
  VEE virus or the reintroduction of virus is unknown.

  eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus) as a vertebrate host for LaCrosse viru=
s in
  nature during late summer when Aedes triseriatus (Say) is most abundant.
  Movement, home range and density of chipmunk populations were determined =
by
  mark and recapture techniques. The seasonal abundance of A. triseriatus w=
as
  estimated by use of oviposition traps. Passive antibodies to this virus w=
ere
  found in spring-born juvenile chipmunks captured before mid-July and in s=
ummer
  -born juveniles in September. Active antibodies neutralising LaCrosse vir=
us
  were first detected in susceptible chipmunks in mid-July, and 68 free-liv=
ing
  and 4 sentinel animals developed antibodies during the study. Virus
  transmission continued at a high rate during August but was not detected =
in
  September. Chipmunk habitat was ranked for quality and populations of
  chipmunks. A. triseriatus was more abundant in study areas that had the m=
ost
  suitable chipmunk habitat. The rise and fall in population of A. triseria=
tus
  were associated with the rise and fall in the elaboration of antibodies i=
n
  chipmunks. In one study area, antibody prevalence rates in adult and spri=
ng
  -born juveniles reached 100% by September. The findings implicate A.
  triseriatus as the vector and establish chipmunks as important amplifying=
 hosts
  in discontinuous foci of virus transmission.

  in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Bertioga was isolated from sentinel mice exposed in=

  of arboviruses. Anhembi virus was isolated from a pool of females of Phon=
iomyia
  pilicauda (Root) and one of Trichoprosopon pallidiventer (Lutz) and from =
a
  spiny rat (Proechimys iheringi); it was shown to be a new member of the
  Bunyamwera group. The viruses are sensitive to sodium desoxycholate and a=
re
  filterable through a millipore membrane of 450 mu m pore size. Both are
  pathogenic for suckling mice and grow well in Vero cells, producing clear
  cytopathic effects. Detailed antigenic comparisons of Anhembi virus with =
other
  members of the Bunyamwera group isolated in the Americas, and of Bertioga=
 virus
  with the members of the Guama group are presented.

AB: A five-year (1959-1963) virological and serological survey in Kern Coun=

  California, revealed that wild mammals had been infected with several
  arboviruses. Seven strains of virus were recovered from 1889 blood sample=

  strain of western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE) virus was isolated from
  Ammospermophilus nelsoni and one from Mus musculus, 3 strains of Buttonwi=
llow
  virus from Sylvilagus audubonii and 1 from Lepus californicus, and 1 stra=
in of
  an adenovirus from Peromyscus maniculatus. No virus was isolated from 131=
4
  ticks or 1795 fleas collected on mammals or in burrows. Based on
  haemagglutination-inhibition tests, antibodies to WEE virus were frequent=
 in L.
  californicus but rare in other species. Antibodies to St. Louis encephali=
tis
  (SLE), Powassan and Modoc viruses, but not to Rio Bravo virus, were wides=
pread.
  The yearly prevalence of antibodies to any one group-B arbovirus varied.
  Antibody to SLE virus decreased and antibody to Powassan virus increased =
during
  the five years. Antibody rates to WEE virus in L. californicus fluctuated=
 in
  the same manner as viral infection rates in Culex tarsalis Coq. and immun=
ity
  conversion rates in sentinel chickens. No such relationship was found for=
 WEE
  and SLE viral antibodies in rodents.

AB: There have been intermittent epidemics and epizootics in equines of
  Venezuelah equine encephalitis virus on the dry Pacific coastal plain of =
Peru
  since at least the 1930's. However, evidence that the virus exists in the
  Amazon region of Peru to the east of the Andes was not obtained until
  antibodies were found in human sera collected in 1965. Ten strains of the=
 virus
  were isolated in a forest near the city of Iquitos on the Amazon in easte=
rn
  Peru during February and March 1971. Eight strains were from female mosqu=
itos
  and two from dead sentinel hamsters. Three hamsters exposed in forests ne=
ar
  Iquitos developed antibodies to Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus sugg=
esting
  that hamster-benign strains also exist there. Antibody tests of equine se=
ra
  revealed no evidence that the virus was actively circulating during the l=
ate
  1950's or 1960's in southern coastal Peru, where equine epizootics had oc=
curred
  in the 1930's and 1940's. In northern coastal Peru on the border with Ecu=
ador,
  antibodies were found in equine sera, presumably resulting from the 1969
  outbreak caused by subtype I virus, since neutralising antibody titres we=
re
  higher to subtype I virus than to subtypes III or IV. No activity of the =
virus
  was detected in this northern region during the dry season of 1970 by use=
 of
  sentinel hamsters. The possibility is considered that epidemics and equin=
e
  epizootics on the Pacific coast of Peru are caused by movements of the vi=
rus in
  infected vertebrates traversing Andean passes or in infected vertebrates =
or
  mosquitos carried in aeroplanes from the Amazon region.

  the primary and secondary vectors of Leucocytozoon smithi. An area 16.1 k=
m in
  diameter near Pageland, which contained several commercial breeder turkey
  farms, was used for the study. Seven treatments beginning in March and en=
ding
  in August 1972 were applied to infested streams in the area at monthly
  intervals by slow-flying helicopters at the rate of 91 g active ingredien=
t/0.4
  ha. Adult and larval Simuliid populations in the treatment zone were redu=
ced
  substantially from the levels of the previous year. There was also a shar=
p
  decrease in the level of L. smithi in the blood of sentinel turkeys durin=
g the
  same period. The effectiveness of the treatment programme was demonstrate=
d, and
  the cost (about $10 000 should be economically feasible for a large-scale
  turkey breeding operation.

due to
  this virus has been reported in Sao Paulo, and farmers living in two area=

ther
  isolates of the virus have been obtained since 1971, it could have disapp=
eared
  from the region, and is probably not endemic there.

AB: A total of 269 virus strains was obtained from male and female Phleboto=
mids
  collected at human bait, in light-traps and while resting at two localiti=
es in
  Panama from 1969 to 1971. These isolates represented nine different virus=
 types
  (Changuinola, VSV-Indiana (vesicular stomatitis virus-Indiana), Punta Tor=
o-CoAr
  3319, Chagres, VP-175A, VP-437R, VP-161A, VP-488A, and VP-118D) as well a=
s
  several unidentified agents. The last five virus types are new. Changuino=
la
  complex viruses and Punta Toro-CoAr 3319 complex viruses were the most
  frequently encountered and represented 52% and 19% of the isolates,
  respectively. From man-biting Phlebotomids processed by species, the high=
est
  isolation rates were obtained from Lutzomyia trapidoi (Fairchild & Hertig=
).
  Analysis of the seasonal isolation of virus indicated that activity of
  Changuinola, Chagres, VP-175 and VP-437R was continuous and that of VSV-I=
ndiana
  [cf. RAE/B 55, 747] and Punta Toro-CoAr 3319 was intermittent. Seventeen
  isolates, representing six different virus types, were obtained from male
  Phlebotomids. Isolation rates by sex for three of the virus types were si=
milar
  in collections yielding comparable numbers of males and females. The freq=
uency
  of virus isolations from males suggests that transovarial transmission of
  several of these agents occurs in nature [cf. 26, p.241].Neutralisation t=
ests
  on sera from inhabitants of seven rural Panamanian communities demonstrat=
ed a
  significant amount of human infection with VSV-Indiana, Punta Toro and VP=
-437R.
  Caged sentinel animals, exposed at one of the collection sites, became in=
fected
  with VSV-Indiana, Chagres, VP-175A and VP-437R. The study demonstrated th=
e
  superiority of the Vero-cell culture system over newborn mice for primary
  isolation of virus isolates from Phlebotomids. By using infected Vero cel=
ls as
  complement-fixing antigen for typing isolates, the necessity of blind pas=
sing
  many viruses in order to establish mouse pathogenicity was eliminated.

AB: Following the widespread epizootic and epidemic of Venezuelan equine
  encephalitis in Mexico in 1971 [RAE/B 62, 104], isolated outbreaks occurr=
ed in
  the western States, including Guerrero, early in 1972, and a more intensi=
ve one
  began in June in Morelos and three contiguous central states. The conditi=
ons in
  which the disease had developed in Morelos were studied in July. Serologi=
cal
  studies on man, equines, bovines, pigs and dogs involved in the outbreak =
showed
  that there had been no previous contact with the virus. Antibodies were n=
ot
  found at initial examinations but were present at high titres at subseque=
nt
  ones. Morbidity both in man and equines and mortality in equines were
  consequently high. The virus was isolated from the blood and pharyngeal
  exudates of sick people and equines. It was isolated from 92% of the huma=
n and
  in 71.4% of the equine specimens studied, and its presence was also
  demonstrated in bovines, pigs and dogs; it was also isolated six times fr=
om
  sentinel mice. Some of the dogs showed transitory signs of neurological
  disorders. Mosquitos of the genera Psorophora, Culex, Aedes, Limatus and
  Anopheles were caught and processed for virus isolation. The virus was is=
olated

TI: Investigations into the epidemiology of bovine petechial fever in Kenya=
 and

LS: French, Spanish
AB: Bovine petechial fever is caused by a rickettsia-like organism, Cytoece=
tes
  ondiri. It cannot be transmitted by contact and is sporadic in occurrence=
 and
  transmission by an arthropod is presumed. The disease is only known in Ke=
nya.
  Previous studies have shown that cattle can contract the disease 1-2 week=
s
  after being introduced into an area that has been unstocked for 2 years,
  suggesting an arthropod and wild mammal cycle. Attempts to isolate the or=
ganism
  from 5 species of mammals have been unsuccessful but the organism has bee=
n
  shown to multiply in some wild ruminants and to persist in laboratory rod=
ents.
  Other work showed no transmission capability in biting flies of 6 genera =
and
  ticks of 3 genera. Also, the habits and life-cycles of biting flies do no=
t fit
  in well with the field picture of the disease, and fleas and lice are rar=
e in
  range conditions. However, close parallels between the epidemiology of sc=
rub
  typhus and bovine petechial fever suggested that Trombiculid mites might =
be the
  vectors and rodents the reservoirs.Eight farms in Kenya where the disease=
 was
  endemic were investigated. The mean number of Trombiculids on trapped rod=
ents
  was low, mostly between 5 and 10. The only diurnal biting flies found wer=
e
  Stomoxys spp., and Culicoides and Culicines were caught only in low numbe=
rs at
  night. No Trombiculids were found on cattle, but Rhipicephalus appendicul=
atus
  Neum. and R. evertsi Neum. were collected. No sentinel cattle contracted =
the
  disease. Six pools, including 20-300 examples of species of Trombicula an=
d
  Ascoschoengastia, together with 2 pools of R. appendiculatus and R. evert=
si and
  spleens from 54 wild rodents were all negative for the disease on inocula=
tion
  into sheep. It is concluded that the distribution of the disease is not
  strictly limited to any one particular type of habitat and that Trombicul=
ids
  and rodents are no more likely to be vectors and reservoirs than are tick=
s and
  wild ruminants.

  the seasonal rains. The prevalence of HI antibody was high in dogs, cattl=
e and
  indigenous pigs, but, except for a small group of horses, the geometric m=
ean
  titre was much higher in pigs than in other mammals. Antibody to Tembusu =
virus,
  rather than to Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), was prevalent in high t=
itre
  in domestic fowl. Paired serum samples collected from indigenous pigs, ca=
ttle
  and dogs confirmed that primary JEV infections occurred during the human
  epidemic in these species; animals with prior JEV antibodies were not inf=
ected.
  Only a small percentage of tree sparrow and bat serum samples neutralized=
 JEV.
  One pig infected with JEV under laboratory conditions developed a viraemi=
a of
  high titre and long duration. Buffalo and cattle on the other hand, faile=
d to
  develop detectable viraemia and had a poor HI antibody response following
  exposure to JEV-infected Culex tritaeniorhynchus and repeated inoculation=
s of
  JEV. One of three dogs developed low level viraemia after being bitten by=
 JEV
  -infected mosquitoes. The serological responses of these experimentally
  infected animals mimicked the serological patterns observed in domestic a=
nimals
  in the field. All of these results together suggest that pigs are importa=
nt in
  the epidemiology of JEV in the Chiangmai Valley; the role of other domest=
ic
  mammals is less certain. A pig-mosquito-man transmission sequence may be
  sufficient to account for human infections that occur throughout the year=

  Immunisation should modify this cycle. An account is given of a study in =

  serial isolations of virus and tests for haemagglutination-inhibiting ant=

  to it in pigs were made in non-immunised animals and in others immunised =
before
  the onset of the epidemic season, and associated mosquitos were examined =
for
  virus. Viraemia and serological evidence of infection were seen in all te=
n pigs
  that were not immunised. In the immunised group, 6 of 11 pigs did not sho=
w
  viraemia; in the other five, it was of shorter duration than that seen in=
 the
  non-immunised animals. Japanese encephalitis virus was recovered from 38 =
of 486
  pools of mosquitos (comprising 97 000 individuals of the complex of Culex
  tritaeniorhynchus Giles and C. vishnui Theo.) trapped at five sites near =
the
  pig pens. Most of these recoveries were made in July and August. The rate=
 of
  virus isolation from mosquitos caught in the pen containing immunised pig=
s was
  higher than that from mosquitos caught in the pen containing susceptible
  animals. Sentinel rabbits kept in the two pens showed no differences; all
  developed antibodies to the virus and some developed viraemia. Neverthele=
ss,
  immunisation clearly reduced the extent of viraemia, virus titre and the
  duration of viraemia in pigs exposed to natural infection.

AB: The epidemiology of western equine encephalitis in Culex tarsalis Coq.,
  house sparrows (Passer domesticus) and man was studied in Hale County, Te=

  1965-69 [cf. RAE/B 60, 300]. In 1965 and 1966 when 11 and 12 cases were
  observed in man, the percentages of nestling sparrows found infected in w=
eeks
  27-36 of each year were much higher (26.9 and 28.3%) than in the years 19=
67-69
  when no human cases occurred (4.8-8.5%). However, in 1965-66, the infecti=
on
  rates of C. tarsalis in weeks 27-36 (39.2%) and the antibody rates in Oct=
ober
  -November in sparrows (54.5-56.4%) and sentinel fowls (85-85.7%) were onl=

 28.7
  -30.8%, 35.6-44.5% and 42.9-70.1%, respectively). The virus was also foun=
d in
  sparrows a little earlier in the year in the two epidemic years than in t=
he 3
  non-epidemic years. The house sparrow forms over two-thirds of the bird
  population in the county, and it is considered that this species may be t=

AB: A serological survey for antibodies to group A and group B arboviruses,
  Pseudomonas pseudomallei, and Rickettsia tsutsugamushi was conducted in
  Thailand. Serum samples were collected from 232 sentry dogs and 222 human=
 dog
  handlers at the time of their arrival in that country and quarterly there=
after
  for 1 year. Tests with the four antigens were negative for dogs and handl=
ers on
  arrival. Both dogs and handlers developed haemagglutination-inhibiting
  antibodies to group A arboviruses at the rate of 3% annually. Rates of ch=
ange
  of serotest results to positive for group B arbovirus antibody were 41% f=
or
  dogs and 34% for human handlers. Neither human handlers nor dogs develope=
d
  detectable antibodies against P. pseudomallei or R. tsutsugamushi. The hi=
ghest
  incidence of group B arbovirus antibody occurred during September to Dece=
mber.
  Dogs developed detectable antibody in 55% of the collection periods, and =
may
  therefore be of value as sentinel animals. A survey at Da Nang Air Base, =
South
  Vietnam, consisting of single samples from each of 50 sentry dogs, gave
  negative results, except that most had antibodies to group B arboviruses.

AB: All of six baboons inoculated i/m with monkey pox virus became infected=
 and
  one died. Two of six sentinel animals also became infected through natura=
l
  transmission of the virus from infected room-mates. Clinical signs includ=
ed the
  formation of vesicular lesions on the extremities, face, lips, and buccal
  cavity about eight days after infection. At the tame time HI and plaque
  -neutralizing (PN) antibodies were detected. One week later c.f. antibody=
 was
  formed, reaching its peak in one week. With the exception of PN antibodie=
s, a
  gradual decline to a plateau was noted over a 16-week period. All the nat=
urally
  infected animals withstood a challenge inoculation of monkey pox virus.

TI: Study of an attenuated strain of feline infectious enteritis

AB: When cats with a respiratory disease were inoculated with a living,
  attenuated, feline infectious enteritis vaccine, vaccine virus spread to
  respiratory disease-infected in-contact controls. These in-contact contro=
ls
  were able to infect other cats with which they were placed in contact, so=
 that
  after five natural transmissions in this way and two oral administrations=
 and
  subsequent re-isolations, reversions to virulence became evident. It is c=
lear
  that before general release of a new, living, feline infectious enteritis
  vaccine, there must be satisfactory evidence that concurrent infection wi=
ll not
  affect the safety of the modified antigen. In feline infectious enteritis=
 there
  appears to be a short period, coinciding with the onset of leucopenia, du=
ring
  which the disease is highly infectious. It seems possible that some infec=
ted
  animals may become immune carriers, because virus has been recovered from=
 the
  small intestine of two of four cats with significant antibody titres 22-2=
4 days
  after exposure to infection. The propensity of the attenuated strain to s=
pread
  from vaccinated cats affected with intercurrent respiratory disease to
  unvaccinated, in-contact cats was eradicated by further passaging of the
  vaccine virus in tissue culture. No virus was recovered from, and no anti=
body
  was found in the sentinel cats in contact with seven vaccinated animals. =
Thus,
  a further 27 passages of the vaccine virus in tissue culture has eliminat=
ed the
  spread factor.
