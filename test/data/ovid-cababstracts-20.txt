SO  - Chinese Journal of Virology. Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Virology, Beijing, China: 2005. 21: 4, 284-288. 10 ref. 
AB  - The haemagglutinin (HA) genes from subtype H5N1 and H9N2 avian influenza viruses were directly inserted into transferring vector p11S, resulting in the production of recombinant transferring vector p11SH5H9. Then the recombinant transferring vector p11SH5H9 was used to transfect chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF), which was pre-infected with wild type fowl pox virus, to generate recombinant fowl pox virus co-expressing H5A and H9A (rFPV-11SH5H9). By selection of blue plaques on the CEF, overlaid with agar containing X-gal, rFPV-11SH5H9 was obtained and purified. The in vitro expression of HA by rFPV-11SH5H9 was detected in recombinant virus-infected CEF by indirect immunofluorescence assay. Experiments on chickens demonstrated that rFPV-11SH5H9 had the same protective efficacy to suppress SPF chickens from shedding challenged virus as that of subtype H9N2 inactivated vaccine and to protect SPF chickens against lethal challenge with homologous subtype HSN1 avian influenza virus. The results showed that the rFPV-11SF5H9 has a good applied foreground.

SO  - International Journal of Agriculture and Biology. Friends Science Publishers, Faisalabad, Pakistan: 2005. 7: 4, 564-566. 13 ref. 
AB  - A serological survey for quantification of antibodies to avian influenza virus (AIV) subtype H7N3 in vaccinated layer flocks was carried out in central Punjab. A total of 288 serum samples were collected (243 from commercial layer farms & 45 from layer breeder farms). Serum samples from commercial layer flocks were divided into four age groups (15-25, 25-35, 35-45, 45-55 weeks) and for layer breeder flocks into three age groups (16, 22, & 26 weeks). Haemagglutination Inhibition (HI) test was performed for the determination of serum antibodies against AIV-subtype H9N2. Calculated geometric mean titers (GMT) for commercial layer groups 15-25, 25-35, 35-45 and 45-55 weeks of age, were found to be 59.7, 104.0, 147.0 and 137.2, respectively. GMT values for layer breeder groups 16, 22, and 26 weeks of age were found to be 111.4, 207.9 and 128.0, respectively. The results showed that the level of protection of vaccinated birds against AIV-subtype H7N3 was found satisfactory in commercial layer flocks as well as in layer breeder flocks.

TI  - Evolution of H9N2 influenza viruses from domestic poultry in Mainland China.
SO  - Virology. Elsevier Inc., San Diego, USA: 2005. 340: 1, 70-83. many ref. 
AB  - H9N2 viruses have circulated in domestic poultry in Mainland China since 1994, and an inactivated vaccine has been used in chickens to control the disease since 1998. The present study analyzed 27 H9N2 avian influenza viruses that were isolated from chickens and ducks from 1996 to 2002. Infection studies indicated that most of the viruses replicate efficiently but none of them is lethal for SPF chickens. However, these viruses exhibit different phenotypes of replication in a mouse model. Five viruses, including 4 early isolates and one 2000 isolate, are not able to replicate in mice; 14 viruses replicate to moderate titers in mouse lungs and cause less than 5% weight loss, while other 8 viruses could replicate to high titers in the lungs and 7 of them induce 10-20% weight loss of the mice on day 5 after inoculation. Most of the viruses isolated after 1996 are antigenically different from the vaccine strain that is currently used in China. Three viruses isolated in central China in 1998 are resistant to adamantanes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all of the viruses originated from CK/BJ/1/94-like virus and formed multiple genotypes through complicated reassortment with QA/HK/G1/97-, CK/HK/G9/97-, CK/SH/F/98-, and TY/WI/66-like viruses. This study is a description of the previously uncharacterized H9N2 avian influenza viruses recently circulating in chickens and ducks in Mainland China. Our findings suggest that urgent attention should be paid to the control of H9N2 influenza viruses in animals and to the human's influenza pandemic preparedness.

AB  - Quails could be an intermediate host of influenza viruses and living quails are very commonly for sale in the poultry markets in south China. Between January and April 2004, 133 healthy quails were randomly chosen from 4 poultry markets (5-10 quails per market weekly) in Shantou (Guangdong province, China). Samples (swabs) were collected from the trachea and the cloacal chamber from each quail and were inoculated into the allantoic cavity of 9-11 days old chicken embryos. The liquid was collected from the allantoic cavity after 48 h incubation (at 35 degrees C) for virus separation and identification. Haemagglutination test detected 34 positive samples, which were all collected from the trachea; the positive rate was 25.56% (34/133). Haemagglutination inhibition test showed that 30 of the positive samples were haemagglutinin subtype H9, 6 were H6 and 1 was H5.

AB  - Several H10 subtype avian influenza A viruses isolated from aquatic birds in East China were identified by specific reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The haemagglutinin (HA) gene of one representative strain, Dk/YZ/502/03, was sequenced and its pathogenicity to specific pathogen free (SPF) chickens and BALB/c mice were determined. The HA's nucleotide sequence shared a high identity with that of strain A/Mink/Sweden/84 (H10N4)m, and the P-E-I-M-Q-G-R sequence of the cleavage site of the deduced amino acid was characteristic of avian influenzaviruses with low pathogenicity, which agreed with the pathogenicity results of strain Dk/YZ/502/03 to chickens and mice.

AB  - Outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), which originate in poultry upon transmission of low pathogenic viruses from wild birds, have occurred relatively frequently in the last decade. During our ongoing surveillance studies in wild birds, we isolated several influenza A viruses of haemagglutinin subtype H5 and H7 that contain various neuraminidase subtypes. For each of the recorded H5 and H7 HPAI outbreaks in Europe since 1997, our collection contained closely related virus isolates recovered from wild birds, as determined by sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of the hemagglutinin gene and antigenic characterization of the haemagglutinin glycoprotein. The minor genetic and antigenic diversity between the viruses recovered from wild birds and those causing HPAI outbreaks indicates that influenza A virus surveillance studies in wild birds can help generate prototypic vaccine candidates and design and evaluate diagnostic tests, before outbreaks occur in animals and humans.

SO  - Chinese Journal of Veterinary Medicine. Guoji Shudian (Institute of Scientific and Technological Information of China, China Publications Centre), Beijing, China: 2003. 39: 12, 14. 
AB  - An avian influenza virus strain was collected from an egg-laying poultry farm in Xinxiang, Henan, China. Based on haemagglutination inhibition test and subtype and RT-PCR [reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction] identification, the strain was identified as H9N2 subtype. It showed 99.6% homology as compared with the A/Chicken/Shandong/6/96(H9N2) sequence. It contained only 2 discontinuous alkaline amino acids, indicating that it is a low pathogenetic virus strain. On the 4th and 5th day of the challenge experiment, chickens showed the symptoms of temporary languid and a slight loss of appetite, but showed subsequently rapid rehabilitation. The A type avian influenza virus with haemagglutination activity was named A/Chicken/Henan/1/1999 H9N2.

AB  - Three hundred and four samples of chicken meat were used to detect AIV (avian influenza virus) by using fluorescent RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction). Results showed that 26 positive AIV were detected within 4 hours by fluorescent RT-PCR against 22 positive AIV detected within 15 days by the classical virus isolation technique. In both cases, the repetition rates reached 100%. Compared with the latter, the former is of high specificity, and saves time.

AB  - Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses are not only the cause of devastating "bird flu" outbreaks in domestic fowl, but are also occasionally the cause of human disease with a high mortality rate as is being currently observed with the H5N1 viruses in South-East Asia. Infection in birds is systemic with hemorrhages and edema as characteristic symptoms, and virus replication in the endothelium appears to play an important role in pathogenesis. Some of the factors determining endotheliotropism have been elucidated at the molecular and cellular level. They include proteolytic activation of the hemagglutinin, polarity of virus budding, and tissue specific expression of virus receptors.

TI  - Subtype identification of avian influenza virus on DNA microarray.
SO  - Agricultural Sciences in China. Editorial Department of Agricultural Sciences in China, Beijing, China: 2005. 4: 9, 700-706. 21 ref. 
AB  - A rapid microarray-based assay for the reliable detection of avian influenzavirus (AIV) subtypes H5, H7 and H9 was developed. The strains used in this experiment were A/Goose/Guangdong/1/96 (H5N1), A/African starling/983/79 (H7N1) and A/Turkey/Wisconsin/1/66 (H9N2). The target DNA clones which encoded approximately 500 bp AIV gene fragments obtained by RT-PCR were spotted on a slide-bound microarray. Cy5-labelled fluorescent cDNAs generated from virus RNA during by reverse transcription were hybridized to these target DNAs. These target DNAs contained multiple fragments of the haemagglutinin and matrix protein genes of AIV, used respectively, for subtyping and typing AIV. The arrays were scanned to determine the probe binding sites. The hybridization pattern agreed approximately with the known grid location of each target. Scanning images of H5 and H7 samples were in accordance to those expected. Results showed that cDNAs of influenzaviruses could be detected directly on microchips. Moreover, DNA microarray technology was found to be a useful diagnostic method for AIV.

AB  - Discussions on the development, mode of action, pharmacokinetics and efficiency of neuraminidase inhibitors as drugs for the treatment of influenza infections are presented. Focus was given on the two most common neuraminidase inhibitors, viz. zanamivir (Relenza) and oseltamivir (Tamiflu). Data from clinical trials for these two drugs, involving adults, the elderly and children, are also presented. The importance of antiviral drugs as part of a strategy in dealing with an influenza pandemic, including avian influenza, is discussed.
