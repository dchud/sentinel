TI  - Virulence differences between monkeypox virus isolates from West Africa and the Congo basin.
SO  - Virology. Elsevier Inc., San Diego, USA: 2005. 340: 1, 46-63. many ref. 
AB  - Studies indicate that West African and Congo basin isolates of monkeypox virus (MPXV) are genetically distinct. Here, we show Congo basin MPXV-ZAI-V79 is more virulent for cynomolgus monkeys as compared to presumed West African MPXV-COP-58. This finding may explain the lack of case-fatalities in the U.S. 2003 monkeypox outbreak, which was caused by a West African virus. Virulence differences between West African and Congo basin MPXV are further supported by epidemiological analyses that observed a similar prevalence of antibodies in non-vaccinated humans in both regions, while >90% of reported cases occurred in the Congo basin, and no fatal cases were observed outside of this region. To determine the basis for this difference in virulence, we sequenced the genomes of one human West African isolate, and two presumed West African isolates and compared the sequences to Congo basin MPXV-ZAI-96-I-16. The analysis identified D10L, D14L, B10R, B14R, and B19R as possible virulence genes, with D14L (ortholog of vaccinia complement protein) as a leading candidate.

AB  - Ectromelia virus (ECTV) is an orthopoxvirus whose natural host is the mouse; it is related closely to Variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, and Monkeypox virus, the cause of an emerging zoonosis. The recent sequencing of its genome, along with an effective animal model, makes ECTV an attractive model for the study of poxvirus pathogenesis, antiviral and vaccine testing and viral immune and inflammatory responses. This review discusses the pathogenesis of mousepox, modulation of the immune response by the virus and the cytokine and cellular components of the skin and systemic immune system that are critical to recovery from infection.

AB  - Zoonoses have assumed increasing importance for public health since over 75% of newly emerging diseases that have affected people over two last decades appeared to have zoonotic character. Among factors influencing the emergence of new zoonoses are environmental changes, population migration, urban decay, international travel and trade, globalization of food supplies and changes in food processing, immunosuppression, microbial adaptation and resistance. The epidemics and outbreaks of BSE, SARS, of highly virulent influenza virus infections, West Nile virus encephalitis, Ebola, Nipah, Rift Valley fever, monkeypox, Lyme borreliosis, and foodborne diseases (caused by: Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., enterohaemolytic Escherichia coli, Toxoplasma gondii, Cryptosporidium spp.) have demonstrated the global importance of emerging zoonoses. The rapid distribution of information, careful monitoring and new diagnostic methods should enhance the control measures thus help in public health protection.

AB  - Vaccination with live vaccinia virus affords long-lasting protection against variola virus, the agent of smallpox. Its mode of protection in humans, however, has not been clearly defined. Here we report that vaccinia-specific B-cell responses are essential for protection of macaques from monkeypox virus, a variola virus orthologue. Antibody-mediated depletion of B cells, but not CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, abrogated vaccine-induced protection from a lethal intravenous challenge with monkeypox virus. In addition, passive transfer of human vaccinia-neutralizing antibodies protected nonimmunized macaques from severe disease. Thus, vaccines able to induce long-lasting protective antibody responses may constitute realistic alternatives to the currently available smallpox vaccine (Dryvax).

AB  - Genes for tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-binding proteins (CrmBs) of the variola virus (VARV), monkeypox virus (MPXV) or cowpox virus (CPXV) were isolated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from viral genomes and expressed in a baculovirus system in the Spodoptera frugiperda Sf21 insect cell line. Properties of the purified recombinant proteins were studied by various physicochemical and immunological methods. Using solid-phase enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), it was shown that viral proteins inhibited hTNF binding with polyclonal anti-hTNF antibodies, with the efficiency of inhibition decreasing in the series VARV-CrmB > CPXV-CrmB > MPXV-CrmB. Biological activity of the recombinant protein preparations was assessed by their ability to neutralize TNF cytotoxicity on the L929 murine fibroblast cells line. CrmBs were shown to neutralize cytotoxicity of human, mouse and rabbit TNF in a species-specific manner. It was also shown that the efficiency of VARV-CrmB in inhibiting hTNF cytotoxicity exceeded that of polyclonal anti-hTNF antibodies. Orthopoxviral CrmB proteins can provide a basis for the development of new anti-TNF drugs.

AB  - The Geneva Protocol of 1925 commits the signatory nations to refraining from the use of biological weapons. However, the terrorist assaults of September 2001 and, subsequently, the anthrax-containing letters are cause for great concerns: new threats to the security of nations are expected, as terrorist organizations seem to increasingly explore novel ways of spreading terror. In this context, naturally emerging diseases such as SARS, monkeypox or West Nile fever assume new importance because it is difficult to distinguish between natural epidemics and possible bioweapon assaults. Great efforts on the part of governments and public health authorities are necessary to counteract these threats.

AB  - Studies of experimental infection of prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) with monkeypox virus are described. After intraperitoneal infection, all of the animals died within 11 days. Virus was cultured from their blood and oropharynx several days before death; at necropsy, most of the organs tested contained monkeypox virus. Marked hepatic and splenic necrosis were observed, along with mild inflammatory changes in the lungs. After intranasal (IN) infection, the primary pathologic changes were in the lungs and pleural cavity. Some of the IN infected animals (40%) survived, and monkeypox virus could be cultured from their nasal discharge and oropharynx for <22 days. Ulcerative lesions also developed on the lips, tongue, and buccal mucosa of the surviving animals. Our findings support an earlier report, which suggested that infected prairie dogs can transmit monkeypox virus by respiratory and mucocutaneous contact with susceptible animals and persons.

AB  - Despite the success of the WHO-led smallpox eradication programme a quarter of a century ago, there remains considerable fear that variola virus, or other related pathogenic poxviruses such as monkeypox, could re-emerge and spread disease in the human population. Even today, we are still mostly ignorant about why most poxvirus infections of vertebrate hosts show strict species specificity, or how zoonotic poxvirus infections occur when poxviruses occasionally leap into novel host species. Poxvirus tropism at the cellular level seems to be regulated by intracellular events downstream of virus binding and entry, rather than at the level of specific host receptors as is the case for many other viruses. This review summarizes our current understanding of poxvirus tropism and host range, and discusses the prospects of exploiting host-restricted poxvirus vectors for vaccines, gene therapy or tissue-targeted oncolytic viral therapies for the treatment of human cancers.

AB  - Emerging zoonotic diseases have assumed increasing importance in public and animal health, as the last few years have seen a steady stream of new diseases, each emerging from an unsuspected quarter and causing severe problems for animals and humans. The reasons for disease emergence are multiple, but there are two main factors - expansion of the human population and globalization of trade. Current issues such as the increasing movement of a variety of animal species, ecological disruption, uncultivatable organisms, and terrorism, all imply that emerging zoonotic diseases will in all probability, not only continue to occur, but will increase in the rate of their emergence. The recurring nature of the crises dictates that closer integration of veterinary and medical communities is warranted, along with improved education of the general public and policy makers.

AB  - There are huge numbers of wild animals distributed throughout the world and the diversity of wildlife species is immense. Each landscape and habitat has a kaleidoscope of niches supporting an enormous variety of vertebrate and invertebrate species, and each species or taxon supports an even more impressive array of macro- and micro-parasites. Infectious pathogens that originate in wild animals have become increasingly important throughout the world in recent decades, as they have had substantial impacts on human health, agricultural production, wildlife-based economies and wildlife conservation. The emergence of these pathogens as significant health issues is associated with a range of causal factors, most of them linked to the sharp and exponential rise of global human activity. Among these causal factors are the burgeoning human population, the increased frequency and speed of local and international travel, the increase in human-assisted movement of animals and animal products, changing agricultural practices that favour the transfer of pathogens between wild and domestic animals, and a range of environmental changes that alter the distribution of wild hosts and vectors and thus facilitate the transmission of infectious agents. Two different patterns of transmission of pathogens from wild animals to humans are evident among these emerging zoonotic diseases. In one pattern, actual transmission of the pathogen to humans is a rare event but, once it has occurred, human-to-human transmission maintains the infection for some period of time or permanently. Some examples of pathogens with this pattern of transmission are human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome, influenza A, Ebola virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome. In the second pattern, direct or vector-mediated animal-to-human transmission is the usual source of human infection. Wild animal populations are the principal reservoirs of the pathogen and human-to-human disease transmission is rare. Examples of pathogens with this pattern of transmission include rabies and other lyssaviruses, Nipah virus, West Nile virus, Hantavirus, and the agents of Lyme borreliosis, plague, tularaemia, leptospirosis and ehrlichiosis. These zoonotic diseases from wild animal sources all have trends that are rising sharply upwards. In this paper, the authors discuss the causal factors associated with the emergence or re-emergence of these zoonoses, and highlight a selection to provide a composite view of their range, variety and origins. However, most of these diseases are covered in more detail in dedicated papers elsewhere in this Review.

TI  - Poxvirus Bioinformatics Resource Center: a comprehensive Poxviridae informational and analytical resource. (Special issue: Database issue)
SO  - Nucleic Acids Research. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK: 2005. 33: 1, D311-D316. 17 ref. 
AB  - The Poxvirus Bioinformatics Resource Center (PBRC) has been established to provide informational and analytical resources to the scientific community to aid research directed at providing a better understanding of the Poxviridae family of viruses. The PBRC was specifically established as the result of the concern that variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, as well as related viruses, might be utilized as biological weapons. In addition, the PBRC supports research on poxviruses that might be considered new and emerging infectious agents such as monkeypox virus. The PBRC consists of a relational database and web application that supports the data storage, annotation, analysis and information exchange goals of the project. The current release consists of over 35 complete genomic sequences of various genera, species and strains of viruses from the Poxviridae family. Sequence and annotation information for these viruses has been obtained from sequences publicly available from GenBank as well as sequences not yet deposited in GenBank that have been obtained from ongoing sequencing projects. In addition to sequence data, the PBRC provides comprehensive annotation and curation of virus genes; analytical tools to aid in the understanding of the available sequence data, including tools for the comparative analysis of different virus isolates; and visualization tools to help better display the results of various analyses. The PBRC represents the initial development of what will become a more comprehensive Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center for Biodefense that will be one of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases' 'Bioinformatics Resource Centers for Biodefense and Emerging or Re-Emerging Infectious Diseases'. The PBRC website is available at http://www.poxvirus.org.

AB  - Exotic pets, including hedgehogs, have become popular in recent years among pet owners, especially in North America. Such animals can carry and introduce zoonotic agents, a fact well illustrated by the recent outbreak of monkeypox in pet prairie dogs. We reviewed known and potential zoonotic diseases that could be carried and transmitted by pet hedgehogs or by wild-caught hedgehogs that have been rescued.

AB  - September 11, 2001 demonstrated dramatic voids in national preparedness, and catalyzed massive efforts to identify and remedy vulnerabilities. Since Part I of this series appeared in August 2002, significant improvements have been achieved especially in bioterrorism and chemical terrorism for first responders and emergency medicine, law enforcement, and public health (surveillance). Such efforts manifested benefits during the SARS outbreaks and monkeypox cases of 2003. Nevertheless, emerging infectious diseases will continue to pose a threat if we do not remain vigilant and continue to invest in training, surveillance, and treatments. As expected, many poison centers and toxicologists have taken leadership roles nationwide. In regions where such leadership existed, preparedness levels are strong and collaborations resulted in the development of valuable response plans and training, including the Advanced Hazardous Life Support (AHLS) and Basic Disaster Life Support (BDLS) courses. Early success notwithstanding, experts suggest that current national preparedness has improved slightly from "1" (9/11) to "3" out of "10". Increasingly it has become evident that the nuclear threat, including radiation terrorism, is significant, against which the US remains inadequately prepared. Arguably the nuclear threat - whether accidental or planned - remains our highest consequence vulnerability, and we must rapidly improve our readiness across disciplines. Special populations including the elderly and children remain marginalized in preparedness protocols. Local vulnerabilities including chemical manufacturing and transportation - not just a risk for terrorism but industrial accidents - continue unabated. Our early success is not an endpoint; much work remains and time is fleeting. This report examines vulnerabilities that must be addressed to enhance preparedness.

AB  - The migration of people and the transport of animals beyond their natural environment result in the more and more frequent transfer of some diseases from one continent to another, outside epidemic areas. The last epidemic among people of an illness caused by an animal virus is 81 cases of monkeypox in the USA up until June 2003. This is the first case of the epidemic of this sickness observed in the northern hemisphere. Most cases of the disease occurred after patients had been bitten or scratched by prairie dogs (Cynomys spp.), commonly kept as pets in American homes. It has been proven that the animals became infected from imported Ghana rodents, African rats that constitute a natural reservoir of the virus.

AB  - Monkeypox with extensive lesions was diagnosed in a prairie dog that was involved in a recent human outbreak of monkeypox in the Midwestern United States. Gross lesions included oral ulcers, pulmonary consolidation, enlarged cervical and thoracic lymph nodes, and multifocal, small, white umbilicated plaques in the gastrointestinal wall. Microscopic lesions were extensive in the lungs and consisted of fibrinonecrotic bronchopneumonia with vasculitis and poorly defined eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies in cells thought to be alveolar epithelial cells, histiocytes, and fibroblasts. Multifocal necrotizing lesions, often accompanied by myxedema, were also present in most of the other examined organs. Aggregates of pox viral particles were observed within lesions by transmission electron microscopy. Monkeypox virus infection was confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and virus culture at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This report highlights the difficulties of rapid diagnosis of exotic or emerging diseases and further substantiates the prairie dog as an animal model of monkeypox.

AB  - During the summer of 2003, an outbreak of human monkeypox occurred in the Midwest region of the United States. In all, 52 rodents suspected of being infected with monkeypox virus were collected from an exotic pet dealer and from private homes. The rodents were euthanized and submitted for testing to the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases by the Galesburg Animal Disease Laboratory, Illinois Department of Agriculture. The rodent tissue samples were appropriately processed and then tested by using an integrated approach involving real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, an antigen-detection immunoassay, and virus culture. We designed and extensively tested two specific real-time PCR assays for rapidly detecting monkeypox virus DNA using the Vaccinia virus F3L and N3R genes as targets. The assays were validated against panels of orthopox viral and miscellaneous bacterial DNAs. A pan-orthopox electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay was used to further confirm the presence of Orthopoxvirus infection of the rodents. Seven of 12 (58%) animals (seven of 52 (15%) of all animals) tested positive in both monkeypox-specific PCR assays and two additional pan-orthopox PCR assays (in at least one tissue). The ECL results showed varying degrees of agreement with PCR. One hamster and three gerbils were positive by both PCR and ECL for all tissues tested. In addition, we attempted to verify the presence of monkeypox virus by culture on multiple cell lines, by immunohistology, and by electron microscopy, with negative results. Sequencing the PCR products from the samples indicated 100% identity with monkeypox virus strain Zaire-96-I-16 (a human isolate from the Congo). These real-time PCR and ECL assays represent a significant addition to the battery of tests for the detection of various orthopoxviruses. In light of the recent monkeypox virus transmissions, early detection of the virus is crucial for both natural outbreaks and potential acts of bioterrorism.

TI  - Multi-pathogens sequence containing plasmids as positive controls for universal detection of potential agents of bioterrorism.
SO  - BMC Microbiology. BioMed Central Ltd, London, UK: 2004. 4: 21, (17 May 2004). 23 ref. 
AB  - Background: The limited circulation of many of the agents that are likely to be used in a bioterrorism attack precludes the ready availability of positive controls. This means that only specialized laboratories can screen for the presence of these agents by nucleic amplification assays. Calibrated controls are also necessary for quantitative measurements. Primers and probes to be used in both conventional and real-time PCR assays were designed for the detection of agents likely to be used by a bioterrorist. Three plasmids, each of which contains 4 to 6 specific sequences from agents on the CDC Category A and B list (excluding RNA viruses) were constructed. Two plasmids incorporate the sequences of Category A and B agents, respectively. The third plasmid incorporates sequences from Variola major and organisms that cause rash-like illnesses that may be clinically confused with smallpox. An "exogenic sequence", introducing a NotI restriction site was incorporated in the native sequences of the bioterrorism agents inserted in plasmids. The designed molecular system for detection of bioterrorism agents was tested on each of these agents (except Monkeypox virus, Smallpox virus and 2 Burkholderia species for which no native DNA was available) and a collection of 50 isolates of C. burnetii using constructed plasmids as positive controls. Results: Designed primers and probes allowed molecular detection, in either single or multiplex assays, of agent-specific targets with analytical sensitivities of between 1 and 100 DNA copies. The plasmids could be used as positive controls. False-positive results due to contamination by the positive control were easily detected by sequencing and eliminated by digestion with NotI. Conclusion: Plasmid A and B can be used as positive controls in molecular assays for the detection of bioterrorism agents in clinical specimens or environmental samples. Plasmid C can be used as a positive control in differentiation of vesicular rashes. It is also possible to avoid or to ensure immediate detection of false positive results due to contamination by positive controls using these plasmids. These plasmids and the corresponding primers and probes are immediately available for all clinical microbiology laboratories provided they have molecular amplification equipment.

SO  - Reviews in Medical Virology. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, UK: 2004. 14: 5, 289-300. 43 ref. 
AB  - Several nucleoside and nucleotide analogues have been identified as potent antiviral agents with convincing activity against poxviruses (including variola, vaccinia, monkeypox, cowpox, molluscum contagiosum, orf). Among the nucleoside analogues, 8-methyladenosine and 2-amino-7-[(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxy)methyl]purine (S2242), have been identified as promising anti-poxvirus agents. Among the nucleotide analogues, (S)-1-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)cytosine [(S)-HPMPC, cidofovir], (S)-9-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)-2,6-diaminopurine [(S)-HPMPDAP] and (S)-6-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)oxy-2,4-diaminopyrimidine [(S)-HPMPO-DAPy] have been identified as promising anti-poxvirus agents. These nucleoside and nucleotide analogues have proved to be efficacious in various animal models for poxvirus infections. Only one compound, cidofovir, has also proved efficacious against poxvirus infections in humans, i.e. molluscum contagiosum and orf (sheep pox). Cidofovir is formally licensed for clinical use (intravenous administration for the treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis in AIDS patients); however, it could also be formulated for topical administration, or for oral administration in prodrug form, i.e. as 1-O-hexadecyloxypropyl-cidofovir.

AB  - Since the Prehistoric times hunting has been a vital activity for man. However, this may account for the contamination of the hunter, his family and relatives. Infections may occur by direct contact with blood or tissues of infected animal during handling and cutting up preys and when preparing or eating meat, or also when bitten by injured animal. Apes and antelopes hunting in sub-Saharan Africa prove to be particularly important since it has been well established that the recent or previous emergence of some viral zoonosis (Ebola, aids, T lymphotropic viruses and monkeypox) resulted from hunting and poaching. Moreover predation among different species of non human primates such as that practised by chimpanzees against monkeys, has led to the construction of recombinant simian Lentiviruses, such as SIV cpz able to infect man and then spread over the entire mankind as it was the case with HIV-1. Severe acute respiratory syndrome is another possible example of the zoonotic risks represented by the sale, handling and cutting up Chinese wild animals such as Himalayan civets for culinary purposes.

AB  - Orthopoxviruses, including smallpox, monkeypox and molluscipox, pose risks to human health through bioterrorist acts or natural transmission. There is no approved therapy for orthopoxvirus infections; however, cidofovir (CDV) has been approved as an investigational new drug for emergency treatment of adverse effects following smallpox vaccination. For evaluation of new therapies directed against orthopoxvirus infections, we have utilized immunocompetent, hairless mice (SKH-1) inoculated by a cutaneous route with cowpox virus (CV) or vaccinia virus (VV). Mice subsequently developed skin lesions and virus was recovered from the site of inoculation and quantified. Skin biopsies were evaluated microscopically, revealing brick-like eosinophilic, intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies characteristic of orthopoxvirus infection. SKH-1 mice fully recovered from either CV or VV infection. Immunodeficient Athymic or Rhino mice inoculated with CV or VV had more lesions and severe disease than SKH-1 mice. CV-infected SKH-1 mice were treated either with systemic or topical CDV. Although some protection was achieved with systemic treatment, 5% topical CDV was most effective at reducing virus titers in skin, lung, kidney, and spleen. These models may provide a means for evaluating efficacy of new therapies directed against orthopoxvirus diseases and further confirm the topical activity of CDV against cutaneous infections.

AB  - Prairie dogs (Cynomys spp.) are native to North America. They have proved to be a relatively popular pet in North America and in multiple countries around the world. All or the vast majority of prairie dogs sold in the pet trade are wild caught. Two zoonotic diseases that naturally occur in wild prairie dogs are tularaemia and plague. Epizootics of both of these diseases have occurred in recently captured prairie dogs intended for the pet trade. The lot containing prairie dogs with tularaemia was widely distributed within the United States and internationally before the disease was recognized. Recently, prairie dogs intended for the pet trade were exposed to monkeypox as the result of close contact with several species of wild caught African rodents. Infected prairie dogs developed a systemic disease with cutaneous manifestations. Prairie dogs were distributed to six states before the disease was recognized. As many as 76 people developed monkeypox from exposure to these prairie dogs. The last reported case was in June 2003. Currently, it is illegal to buy, sell, trade, or transport prairie dogs in the United States. However, veterinarians are still permitted to treat them.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During May and June 2003, an outbreak of febrile illness with vesiculopustular eruptions occurred among persons, in the midwestern USA, who had had contact with ill pet prairie dogs obtained through a common distributor. Zoonotic transmission of a bacterial or viral pathogen was suspected. METHODS: We reviewed medical records, conducted interviews and examinations, and collected blood and tissue samples for analysis from 11 patients and one prairie dog. Histopathological and electron-microscopical examinations, microbiological cultures, and molecular assays were performed to identify the aetiologic agent. RESULTS: The initial Wisconsin cases evaluated in this outbreak occurred in 5 males and 6 females ranging in age from 3 to 43 years. All patients reported having direct contact with ill prairie dogs before experiencing a febrile illness with skin eruptions. We found immunohistochemical or ultrastructural evidence of poxvirus infection in skin-lesion tissue from 4 patients. Monkeypox virus was recovered in cell cultures of seven samples from patients and from the prairie dog. The virus was identified by detection of monkeypox-specific DNA sequences in tissues or isolates from 6 patients and the prairie dog. Epidemiological investigation suggested that the prairie dogs had been exposed to at least one species of rodent recently imported into the USA from West Africa. CONCLUSIONS: Our investigation documents the isolation and identification of monkeypox virus from humans in the Western Hemisphere. Infection of humans was associated with direct contact with ill prairie dogs that were being kept or sold as pets.

SO  - Journal of General Virology. Society for General Microbiology, Reading, UK: 2004. 85: 1, 105-117. many ref. 
AB  - The evolutionary relationships of 26 sequenced members of the poxvirus family have been investigated by comparing their genome organization and gene content and by using DNA and protein sequences for phylogenetic analyses. The central region of the genome of chordopoxviruses (ChPVs) is highly conserved in gene content and arrangement, except for some gene inversions in Fowlpox virus (FPV) and species-specific gene insertions in FPV and Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV). In the central region 90 genes are conserved in all ChPVs, but no gene from near the termini is conserved throughout the subfamily. Inclusion of two entomopoxvirus (EnPV) sequences reduces the number of conserved genes to 49. The EnPVs are divergent from ChPVs and between themselves. Relationships between ChPV genera were evaluated by comparing the genome size, number of unique genes, gene arrangement and phylogenetic analyses of protein sequences. Overall, genus Avipoxvirus is the most divergent. The next most divergent ChPV genus is Molluscipoxvirus, whose sole member, MCV, infects only man. The Suipoxvirus, Capripoxvirus, Leporipoxvirus and Yatapoxvirus genera cluster together, with Suipoxvirus and Capripoxvirus sharing a common ancestor, and are distinct from the genus Orthopoxvirus (OPV). Within the OPV genus, Monkeypox virus, Ectromelia virus and Cowpox virus strain Brighton Red (BR) do not group closely with any other OPV, Variola virus and Camelpox virus form a subgroup, and Vaccinia virus is most closely related to CPV-GRI-90. This suggests that CPV-BR and GRI-90 should be separate species.

SO  - Comparative Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases. Pergamon Press, Oxford, UK: 2003. 26: 5/6, 423-430. 13 ref. 
AB  - Bioterrorist attacks occupy a special place amongst the innumerable potential types of terrorist attack, with the intentional release of pox viruses being especially feared in this connection. Apart from the variola virus, the agent responsible for smallpox in humans, the monkeypox virus and numerous other animal pox viruses pose potential risks for humans and animals. This risk scenario also includes recombinations between the various pox viruses, changes in hosts and genetically engineered manipulations of pox viruses. For over 200 years, the method of choice for combatting smallpox was via vaccination with a reproductive, original vaccinia virus. Worldwide eradication of smallpox at the end of the 1970s and the discontinuation of routine smallpox vaccination in 1980 can be credited to such vaccination. Unfortunately, these vaccinations were associated with a large number of postvaccinal impairments, sometimes resulting in death (e.g. postvaccinal encephalitis). The only way to restrict such postvaccinal complications was to carry out initial vaccination within the first 2 postnatal years. Initial vaccination at a later age led to such a sharp increase in the number of vaccines with complications that vaccination had to be discouraged. The dilemma of the smallpox vaccine stocks stems from the fact that a large portion of these stocks are produced with the same vaccinia strains as before. This is irresponsible, especially as the percentage of immune-suppressed persons in the population, for whom vaccination-related complications is increasing. One solution to the dilemma of the smallpox vaccine stocks is the MVA strain. It is harmless, protects humans and animals equally well against smallpox and can be applied parenterally.

AB  - Following the outbreak and epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) particularly in China, there is a growing concern for infectious diseases that have been emerging for the past three decades. These diseases include acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), Lyme disease, Ebola, Hendra and Nipah from bats, and Monkey pox. These occurrences implicate wildlife species as reservoirs of pathogens that threat human health. The article elaborates on the need for up-to-date and accurate understanding of wildlife and human diseases and their relationship in order to prevent and control disease.

AB  - This report summarizes initial descriptive epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data from an outbreak of monkeypox virus in Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin, USA, and interim infection-control guidance and new animal import regulations introduced as a result. As of June 10 2003, a total of 53 cases had been investigated in these 3 states. A total of 14 (26%) patients had been hospitalized, including a child aged <10 years with encephalitis. Detailed clinical information was available for 30 cases, reported in Illinois and Wisconsin. In majority of the patients (22; 73%), a febrile illness either preceded or accompanied the onset of a papular rash. Respiratory symptoms (16; 64%), lymphadenopathy (14; 47%) and sore throat (10; 33%) were also prominent signs and symptoms. All patients had contact with animals. 51 patients reported direct or close contact with prairie dogs (Cynomys sp.) and one patient reported contact with a Gambian giant rat (Cricetomys sp.). One patient had contact with a rabbit that became ill after exposure to an ill prairie dog at a veterinary clinic. Skin biopsies were available for 5 patients; 4 showed orthopox viral antigens by immunohistochemical testing. Monkeypox-specific DNA signatures were also found in a viral isolate derived from lymphoid tissue of a patient's ill prairie dog. Investigation revealed that Gambian giant rats and other rodents imported from Ghana earlier in the year had been housed together with prairie dogs by an animal distributor; as this was probably the source of the infection, the import of rodents from Africa to the USA has been suspended, as has trade in some species.

SO  - Antiviral Research. Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, Netherlands: 2003. 57: 1/2, 41-52. many ref. 
AB  - Several animal models using mice (most frequently), rabbits, or monkeys have been used to identify compounds active against orthopoxvirus infections. The treatment of vaccinia virus infections has been well studied in models involving infection of scarified skin or eyes, or resulting from intravenous, intraperitoneal, intracerebral, or intranasal virus inoculation. Cowpox virus has been used in intranasal or aerosol infection studies to evaluate the treatment of lethal respiratory infections. Rabbitpox, monkeypox, and variola viruses have been employed to a lesser extent than the other viruses in chemotherapy experiments. A review of the literature over the past 50 years has identified a number of compounds effective in treating one or more of these infections, which include thiosemicarbazones, nucleoside and nucleotide analogs, interferon, interferon inducers, and other unrelated compounds. Substances that appear to have the greatest potential as anti-orthopoxvirus agents are the acyclic nucleotides, (S)-1-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)cytosine (cidofovir, HPMPC) and 1-[((S)-2-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,4,2-dioxaphosphorinan-5-yl)methyl]cytosine (cyclic HPMPC), and the acyclic nucleoside analog, 2-amino-7-[(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxy)methyl]purine (S2242). Other classes of compounds that have not been sufficiently studied in lethal infection models and deserve further consideration are thiosemicarbazones related to methisazone, and analogs of adenosine-N1-oxide and 1-(benzyloxy)adenosine.

TI  - Species-specific differences in organization of orthopoxvirus kelch-like proteins.
SO  - Virus Genes. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands: 2002. 24: 2, 157-162. 30 ref. 
AB  - Organization of orthopoxvirus proteins of the kelch superfamily and their genes were analysed and compared. Complete genomic sequences of variola (VAR) strain India-1967 (VAR-IND), monkeypox (MPV) strain Zaire-96-I-16 (MPV-ZAI), vaccinia (VAC) strain Copenhagen (VAC-COP), and species-specific regions of cowpox (CPV) strain GRI-90 (CPV-GRI) viruses were used in the work. Despite the multiplicity of kelch-like proteins in orthopoxviruses, their function was still vague. It was discovered that the genes of orthopoxvirus kelch-like proteins were localized only to the terminal variable regions of the genome and displayed species-specific differences in the lengths of the proteins they potentially encode. All the genes belonging to kelch superfamily in the genome of VAR, which has the only host - the man, were mutationally destroyed. However, CPV, displaying the widest host range among orthopoxviruses, encoded the most numerous set of kelch-like proteins. Weak homologies between kelch-like proteins of one virus were demonstrated as well as high homologies between isologues of different orthopoxvirus species. The comparison performed suggest that CPV virus is most ancient and may be considered as the ancestor of other orthopoxviruses pathogenic for humans.

SO  - Journal of Veterinary Medicine. Series B. Blackwell Wissenschafts-Verlag GmbH, Berlin, Germany: 2002. 49: 1, 17-19. 14 ref. 
AB  - In 1995, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol describing the specific detection of variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, was published. Virulent variola major strains could be differentiated from less virulent variola minor strains because of the distinct amplicon sizes. In the present study, this PCR protocol was applied to DNA from various orthopoxvirus isolates. There was no amplification with the orthopoxvirus species vaccinia, monkeypox, mousepox, or camelpox viruses. However, amplification was observed in 6 out of 15 cowpox virus strains investigated. The size of the amplicons corresponded exactly with the size described for variola minor strains and the nucleotide sequence identity accounted for 97%. Findings are discussed with respect to the evolution of orthopoxvirus species assuming that variola virus most probably stems from a rodent-transmitted cowpox virus-like progenitor.

AB  - The abstracts of studies that made it as competitors for the 'ASVCP Young Investigator Awards' are presented. The abstracts are of varied research topics. The first research deals with the characterization of a bleeding diathesis in a Thoroughbred filly, while the second deals with the evaluation of complete blood count and blood chemistry results in normal and Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected elephants (Elephas maximus). An investigation on an increased mortality among periparturient lamb due to heritable coagulopathy is the topic of the third research. The fourth study deals with the importance of cytokine balance, especially between inducible nitric oxide synthase and transforming growth factor-B1, in the regulation of granulomatous inflammatory response. The expression of atrial natriuretic gene in cats with cardiomyopathy is the topic of the fifth abstract. Other studies include the development of an internet-based learning tool (problem list generator), an investigation of microsphere-based multiplexed analysis on the Luminex 100 flow cytometer (as an alternative for cytokine quantitation), the use of flow cytometer in evaluating murine bone marrow toxicity in pre-clinical drug development and an assessment of the value of urinary albumin excretion in the diagnosis of spontaneous rat nephropathy. Also, a rat model of the relationship of leptin resistance and increased salt sensitivity in obese individuals; a characterization of the haematologic and clinicopathologic changes in the bone marrow of cats with lymphosarcoma; a discussion on an alternate pathway taken by Plasmodium yoelii and other plasmodia to invade host cells (erythrocytes, normocytes and reticulocytes); and a determination of the effects of room temperature storage of blood samples on haematologic parameters are presented. Poster presentations of several aspects of urine analysis (urine pH measurement and staining of urine sediments for the detection of bacteriuria), in dogs and cats, are also presented in separate abstracts.

SO  - Journal of Clinical Microbiology. American Society for Microbiology (ASM), Washington, USA: 2001. 39: 1, 94-100. 31 ref. 
AB  - A restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay was developed to identify and differentiate Old World, African-Eurasian orthopoxviruses (OPV): variola, vaccinia, cowpox, monkeypox, camelpox, ectromelia, and taterapox viruses. The test uses amplicons produced from virus genome DNA by PCR with a consensus primer pair designed from sequences determined for the cytokine response modifier B (crmB) gene of 43 different OPV strains of known taxonomic origin. The primer pair amplified a single specific product from each of the 115 OPV samples tested. Size-specific amplicons identified and differentiated ectromelia and vaccinia virus strains, which contain a truncated crmB gene, and enabled their differentiation from other OPV species. Restriction digests of amplified products allowed the identification and differentiation of variola, monkeypox, camelpox, vaccinia, and cowpox virus species and strains.

SO  - Journal of Virological Methods. 1994. 49: 3, 353-360. 31 ref. 
AB  - The ligase chain reaction (LCR) targets 2 adjacent adenosine residues which are only present in the A-type inclusion protein gene (ATI-gene) of cowpox virus. Two primer pairs were designed with a one base overlap at the junction site and one primer of each pair was labelled with 32P. The ligation product was detected after denaturing PAGE and autoradiography. Before LCR, the corresponding region of the ATI-gene was amplified by a consensus primer-directed polymerase chain reaction. All 18 cowpox virus isolates investigated could be clearly distinguished from 10 vaccinia virus strains, 5 camelpox virus isolates, and from mousepox and monkeypox virus reference strains. The LCR method allows a fast identification of cowpox virus isolates and is useful for the analysis of small mutations within viral genes.

SO  - Journal of General Virology. 1994. 75: 8, 1975-1981. 32 ref. 
AB  - A PCR protocol to detect and differentiate species of the genus Orthopoxvirus was developed by the selection of oligonucleotides located within the gene that encodes the A-type inclusion protein of cowpox virus. The primer pair flanked a region showing distinct and specific DNA deletions in the corresponding sequences of vaccinia, mousepox, monkeypox and camelpox virus so that PCR resulted in DNA fragments of different sizes. This PCR protocol, combined with BglII restriction digests allowed the unequivocal assignment of 42 orthopoxvirus (OPV) strains and isolates to the correct OPV species. The resulting classification corresponded exactly with known biological data from the OPV strains investigated. 13 of 22 cowpox virus isolates could be subtyped by the presence or absence of a small BgIII fragment. DNA sequencing showed that the lack of this BgIII fragment was caused by a deletion of 72 nucleotides.

TI  - Characterization of the gene encoding the A-type inclusion protein of camelpox virus and sequence comparison with other orthopoxviruses.
SO  - Journal of General Virology. 1993. 74: 8, 1679-1684. 26 ref. 
AB  - A gene identified in camelpox virus strain CP-1 is similar to the 160K gene of cowpox virus strain Brighton (BR) that encodes the A-type inclusion body protein (ATIP). The CP-1 gene was mapped, sequenced, and the ATIP-specific mRNA was identified. The open reading frame [2178 nucleotides (nt)] was at a similar position in the CP genome as the one reported for the cowpox virus 160K AT1 gene. DNA sequence comparison showed a deletion of two adjacent adenine residues relative to cowpox virus BR, generating a reading frame shift accompanied by the formation of a translational stop codon. An identical deletion has been described for vaccinia virus strain Western Reserve. The DNA sequence of the corresponding region of monkeypox virus strain Copenhagen showed a deletion leading to a putative stop codon 75 nt upstream of the same stop codons in the camelpox and vaccinia virus genes. These findings are consistent with the expression of truncated ATIPs, of 94K in vaccinia and the camelpox viruses and of 92K in monkeypox virus. In addition, a deletion of 789 bp could be localized downstream of the AT1 open reading frame in camelpox virus isolates of different origin. This causes the transcription of a shortened AT1-specific mRNA (3.7 kb) relative to vaccinia and cowpox viruses (both 4.5 kb). The similarity observed in ATIP encoding and flanking sequences suggests that vaccinia and camelpox viruses are descended from a common ancestor.

AB  - The authors record the first recognized cases of human monkey-pox infection in Gabon. Four children in a single family were infected simultaneously in mid-1987, and 2 died; diagnosis was based on haematogenous virus-isolation (in one of those who died) and on "clinical and epidemiological findings" in the remainder. The fatal cases presented with some of the manifestations of "haemorrhagic fever" and were not dominated by the classical cutaneous symptoms and signs (especially the exanthem). Both liver and spleen were involved, a feature that the authors consider has not previously been documented in human infection, but has been recorded in infected monkeys. The source of the infection was not delineated; there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission. The authors consider that this zoonosis should be considered in individuals in a potentially endemic area (i.e. the humid forests of Central Africa) presenting with clinical manifestations suggestive of a viral haemorrhagic fever.G.C.

AB  - Various combinations of polyclonal and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) of distinct specficity were evaluated as capture or detecting antibodies in an orthopox virus antigen ELISA. Acceptable results were achieved in an assay based on polyclonal antibodies. A 10 times higher sensitivity, however, was obtained using a combination of one monoclonal catching antibody reactive with viral envelope epitopes and polyclonal detection antibodies. This configuration was superior in sensitivity to all others. Specificity was confirmed with 5 vaccinia virus strains (including one recombinant virus) and 8 species of orthopox viruses. Monkeypox and mousepox virus reacted exclusively in the polyclonal assay due to lack of the specific epitope for the monoclonal antibody. The detection limit compared to the infectivity titre was 10superscript 3-104 in the monoclonal/polyclonal and 104-105 TCID50/0.1 ml in the polyclonal combination. The correlation between infectivity- and ELISA-titre was demonstrated by a study of the replication cycle of the rabbitpox virus Utrecht in the permanent rabbit kidney cell line RK-13. With the established ELISAs vaccinia virus could also be detected in organ suspensions of lethally infected NMRI-mice, depending on the level of infectivity.

SO  - Bulletin of the World Health Organization. 1988. 66: 6, 747-752. 24 ref. 
AB  - The ecology of monkeypox virus was investigated in squirrels, terrestrial and arboreal rodents, and bats at Kinshasa, Zaire. In an initial survey carried out at Bumba zone (northern Zaire), blood-samples were obtained from 120 sheep and goats, 67 domestic cats, 172 terrestrial rodents and 21 squirrels (Funisciurus sp. and Heliosciurus sp.) in areas where human monkeypox had previously been reported; the result was that 2 of 18 F. anerythrus squirrels (and none of the other species tested) were seropositive for monkeypox-specific antibodies and 1 of these had pock-like skin lesions-both these and other organs yielded monkeypox virus. The study was later extended to forested country in central and western Zaire. Overall, 1122 terrestrial rodents and insectivores were tested; all were negative. A total of 659 Funisciurus sp. and 101 Heliosciurus sp. squirrels were also studied; 156 (23.7%) and 15 (14.9%) respectively were positive. Of 153 non-human primates tested (most were Cercopithecus ascanius) 12 (7.8%) were seropositive. Experimental studies showed that the virus was efficiently transmitted through air and excreta (vomit and faeces) among captive squirrels and also by skin scarification. However, the virus was not found in ants (which form a significant part of squirrels' diet) which were fed on infected tissues of squirrels.

TI  - Human monkeypox: confusion with chickenpox.
SO  - Acta Tropica. 1988. 45: 4, 297-307. 
AB  - The authors report results of a study carried out in Zaire to estimate the frequency with which a diagnosis of monkeypox can be confused with other "eruptive diseases" including varicella (chickenpox). About 20% of the initial clinical diagnoses were made by physicians and the remainder by medical assistants and nurses. Between 1981 and 1986, 977 individuals with a skin eruption which was not diagnosed as monkeypox were subjected to laboratory investigation (serology, electron microscopic examination and culture of fluid, or scabs from the eruption). Of 730 cases diagnosed as varicella, 24 (3.3%) were monkeypox; 12 (7.3%) of 165 cases of atypical varicella, and 5 (6.1%) of 82 cases in which a clinical diagnosis of the dermatological condition could not be ascertained, were also shown to be monkeypox. Four of the misdiagnosed monkeypox patients died. "Regional pleomorphism", indefinite body-distribution of skin eruptions, and a centripetal distribution of lesions accounted for misdiagnoses in 46%, 49% and 17%, respectively; 76% of misdiagnosed cases had evidence of regional lymphadenopathy.

SO  - Bulletin of the World Health Organization. 1988. 66: 4, 465-470. 
AB  - In 1981 and 1986, 2278 people in Zaire had close contact with a patient (of whom 245 were identified) who had acquired monkeypox from an animal source. During these 6 years, 93 cases were identified in which the infection was considered to have a human origin [see Jezek et al. above]; of these, 69 infections were spread in the first generation, 19 in the second, and 5 in the third or fourth generation. The probability of a close contact becoming ill from a known human case was estimated at 3%. These infections were usually associated with living in an affected household (usually a poorly ventilated hut), under conditions of maximum exposure. The highest attack rate (11.7%) was in unvaccinated household contacts aged <4 years. No evidence was forthcoming that the secondary attack rate differed between 1970-80 and 1981-86. This evidence is considered by the authors to be consistent with the concept that the "monkeypox virus is poorly adapted for sustained transmission between humans and that such transmission does not pose a significant health problem".G.C.

AB  - Between 1981 and 1986, 338 patients in Zaire were diagnosed as suffering from monkeypox; 245 (72%) were considered to have been infected from an animal, and 93 (28%) a human source. Of the former, children accounted for most cases-27% 3-4 years, 20% 5-6 years, and only 4% were >15 years old; male:female ratio was 58:42. Of the latter, the age distribution was more uniform, and infected adults were more common; male:female ratio was 43:57 (i.e. a reversal of that in the animal-infected cases; P <0.05). Analysis of the clinical data (including fatality rates) obtained from the survey did not support the view that those cases infected from a human source (73 were studied, and compared with 222 infected by animals) were more severe, i.e. passage through the human host did not seem to enhance the virulence of the monkeypox virus.

SO  - International Journal of Epidemiology. 1988. 17: 3, 643-650. 
AB  - In order to assess the degree of protection rendered by previous smallpox vaccination (which was discontinued in 1980), and to determine the transmission potential of the monkeypox virus in unvaccinated communities, data on 209 monkeypox cases diagnosed in Zaire during a 5-year period (1980-84) have been analysed. By using scars as the marker of previous vaccination, the authors conclude that this imparted about 85% protection-rate against monkeypox infection. They also consider that the number of human monkeypox cases (which usually have an animal origin) will increase as vaccination-derived protection declines. However, because the monkeypox virus is less transmissible than smallpox was, it will not persist (by person-to-person transmission) in human communities-even in the complete absence of vaccination. The Global Commission for the Certification of Smallpox Eradication recommended (i) the cessation of routine smallpox vaccination in areas endemic for monkeypox, and (ii) encouragement of continuous epidemiological surveillance; this general policy is supported by these authors from their study of this relatively small number of cases.G.C.

AB  - The epidemiological features of 91 cases of monkeypox (MP) reported from 1981 to 1985 in Bumba zone, northern Zaire, are documented. In 68 (75%) cases the clinical diagnosis was confirmed by demonstration of MP virus and by serology. Age range was from 7 months to 29 years; 93% of patients were <15 years old. Smallpox scars were detected in 10 (11%). The cases arose from 61 separate outbreaks; 42 of these consisted of a single recognized case. Average incidence rate in 1981-85 was 0.63 new cases/10 000 population; amongst unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals the average annual primary attack rate was 1.70 and 0.04/10 000, respectively. Secondary attack rates for those with and without a vaccination scar were 0.7% and 4.3%, respectively (P <0.001). Cases occurred throughout the year, and there was evidence of clustering of cases in the northern part of the zone. Many unvaccinated contacts living in close proximity to index cases escaped infection. In 70 cases, an animal source of infection was suspected, and in 21 the origin was considered to be a human one. Overall case-fatality rate was 9%; these 8 deaths occurred sporadically. The low incidence of human MP in this locality is considered to indicate that it has only limited public health importance, even though this is well known to be an enzoonotic area.G.C. Cook

AB  - Orthopoxviruses were compared by means of their late intra-cellular polypeptides (ICPs). HeLa cells were labelled with [35S]methionine at 16 hours after infection and the ICPs were analysed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and auto-radiography. ICPs in three regions of the gels permitted an initial grouping of the 24 viruses examined into four main groups (cowpox, monkeypox, vaccinia, and variola-related viruses). Only cowpox-like viruses had a prominent ICP of MW 177 000, and only monkeypox-like viruses had a heavily labelled ICP of MW 15 500. Viruses in these two groups appeared to have only a single ICP in the 96-103 000 region (MW, 98 000). By contrast, vaccinia-like viruses and variola-like viruses had two ICPs in this region but were distinguished because the ICPs of vaccinia were of higher molecular weight and were apparently reversed with respect to those of variola-like viruses. This was supported by the disappearance on chase of the lower MW vaccinia ICP and the higher MW variola ICP.

AB  - In studies with rabbit, guinea-pig, hamster, mouse and rat, reactions varied from complete resistance to lethal generalized infection with rash. Rabbits and white mice appeared to be the most susceptible species and young animals were more susceptible than adults. Monkeypox virus was found to infect young animals by natural routes, i.e. by mouth and intranasally. Transmission by contact occurred among 10-day-old rabbits. Since antibodies to monkeypox virus may persist for over a year in the serum of convalescent animals, serological examination of animals is recommended for studying the ecology of this virus.

AB  - During the past three years, 13 patients in scattered small-pox free areas of Africa have experienced illnesses clinically similar to smallpox. In no instance was there spread of infection from man to man. The responsible virus has been identified as monkeypox, a virus closely related to but distinct from smallpox virus and previously isolated only from outbreaks in captive monkeys. For smallpox, epidemiological findings, as well as other observations, indicate that there is no reservoir other than man. The occurrence of sporadic although not apparently communicable smallpox-like illnesses caused by monkeypox makes this and related poxviruses of considerable research interest.

AB  - All of six baboons inoculated i/m with monkey pox virus became infected and one died. Two of six sentinel animals also became infected through natural transmission of the virus from infected room-mates. Clinical signs included the formation of vesicular lesions on the extremities, face, lips, and buccal cavity about eight days after infection. At the tame time HI and plaque-neutralizing (PN) antibodies were detected. One week later c.f. antibody was formed, reaching its peak in one week. With the exception of PN antibodies, a gradual decline to a plateau was noted over a 16-week period. All the naturally infected animals withstood a challenge inoculation of monkey pox virus.

AB  - Poxviruses were isolated from the kidneys of an outwardly healthy chimpanzee trapped in the Congo where a case of monkeypox had recently occurred in man, from the kidneys of clinically healthy cynomolgus monkeys in a colony in the Netherlands, and from monkeys with monkeypox in colonies in the USA. It was established that two of the three viruses isolated from animals asymptomatically infected- namely, strain Chimp-9 Chimp-9 from the chimpanzee and strain 64-7255 from the cynomolgus monkeys- although similar to one another differed from the classical Copenhagen strain of monkeypox virus. These two viruses were characterized by the formation of small, monomorphic, well-defined pocks without haemorrhages on infected chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane, by the small plaques of the proliferative type that they produced in cell cultures, by the absence of reactions when they were injected i/d into rabbits by their intensive replication in pig embryo kidney cell cultures, and by a number of other features. Both the viruses were considered close to the variola virus except that they were more pathogenic for mice after intracerebral inoculation. The other virus isolated from a symptomless cynomolgus monkey-strain 64-9411- resembled the two viruses isolated from monkeys with monkeypox and did not differ from the Copenhagen strain.

AB  - Various variola and monkeypox virus strains, as well as virus strains 64-9411, 64-7255 and 64-7275 from healthy monkey kidney, were tested. In chick chorio-allantoic membrane (CAM) culture, monkeypox strains and 64-9411 produced red pocks (0.5 mm after three days). At high dilutions of virus, there were also a few larger (1 mm) white pocks, which became predominant as the temperature was raised from 33 deg to 38 deg C. Inocula of the white pocks passaged through egg membranes yielded a pure mutant, which gave white pocks at 33 deg or 38 deg C, even after passaging in rabbits of RK13 culture. Efforts to isolate a pure 'red pock' strain were unsuccessful. Variola strains and 64-7255 and 64-7275 produced white pocks in CAM, and had similar ceiling temperatures for growth. Monkeypox, white mutant and 64-9411 produced haemorrhagic-necrotic reactions when given i/d to rabbits, and could be transmitted. Strain 64-7255 gave a typical lesion only on the first passage; this strain, 64-7275 and variola virus could not be transmitted in rabbits. In RK13 cell culture, monkeypox, white mutant and 64-9411 formed plaques and could be passaged; variola virus and strains 64-7255 and 64-7275 formed hyperplastic foci in the first passage, but were lost within 3-7 passages. In cytopathic effects on RK13 cells, the white mutant resembled the parent monkeypox strain, white 64-7275 resembled variola virus. Immunofluorescence of infected coverslip cultures of RK13 showed that monkeypox virus infected foci of cells, while variola virus infected cells in a fairly random manner, and strain 64-7275 infected both focally and in a random manner. In chick embryo mortality tests, the D4 value (the log virus dose corresponding to a mean reciprocal survival time of 0.25) of the white mutant monkeypox was 2.4, while those of strains 64-7255 and 64-7275 (5.5 and 5.7 respectively) were similar to that of variola virus (5.1).

AB  - The growth characteristics, including ceiling temperatures for growth, of three strains of monkeypox virus were studied on chick chorioallantoic membrane, growth and plaque formation were studied in RK13 cells, and growth was studied in rabbit dermis. The three strains could not be distinguished by these tests, but could be differentiated from variola, vaccinia, and cowpox viruses. HI tests with homologous and heterologous antisera also showed that the monkeypox strains were indistinguishable, although they could be differentiated from vaccinia and cowpox, but not from variola, viruses. Similar results were obtained in neutralization tests. It is suggested that the monkeypox strains constitute a homogeneous poxvirus entity. The strains can be differentiated from other poxviruses by their cultural characteristics, but serologically they are more closely related to variola than to vaccinia or cowpox viruses.

AB  - In African monkey kidney cells, infectious virions of the virus were synthesized intracellularly by 8 to 9 hours after infection; whereas cell-free virus and HA developed at later, but variable, stages of the growth cycle. Viral antigen(s) detected by immunofluorescence appeared 2 to 3 hours earlier than infectious virus. Monkey pox virus was similar to vaccinia and variola viruses in these respects.
