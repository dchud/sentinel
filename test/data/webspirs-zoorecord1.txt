AB: We describe the first documented field transmission of West Nile (WN) virus
  by a North American mosquito. WN was first detected in northern Florida in
  2001. An intensive mosquito trapping and surveillance program was conducted in
  this region for four nights to assess mosquito transmission of WN. Four
  mosquito traps, each with a single sentinel chicken, were placed at five
  different locations on each of four nights. A total of 11,948 mosquitoes was
  collected, and 14 mosquito pools were found to contain WN, giving a minimum
  infection rate between 1.08 and 7.54 per 1,000. Only one of the 80 sentinel
  chickens seroconverted to WN, demonstrating a single mosquito transmission
  event during the study and a mosquito transmission rate of between 0.8 and 1
  per 1,000. Culex nigripalpus Theobald was responsible for WN transmission to
  the sentinel chicken, although both Cx. nigripalpus and Culex quinquefasciatus
  Say were found infected with WN. Mosquito transmission rates are reported in
  this study for the first time for a WN outbreak. This information is essential
  to determine risk of human and animal infection.

AB: Incursions of Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus into northern Queensland are
  currently monitored using sentinel pigs. However, the maintenance of these pigs
  is expensive, and because pigs are the major amplifying hosts of the virus,
  they may contribute to JE transmission. Therefore, we evaluated a mosquito
  -based detection system to potentially replace the sentinel pigs. Single,
  inactivated JE-infected Culex annulirostris Skuse and C. sitiens Wiedemann were
  placed into pools of uninfected mosquitoes that were housed in a MosquitoMagnet
  Pro (MM) trap set under wet season field conditions in Cairns, Queensland for
  0, 7, or 14 d. JE viral RNA was detected (cycling threshold [CT] = 40) in
  11/12, 10/14, and 2/5 pools containing 200, 1,000, and 5,000 mosquitoes,
  respectively, using a TaqMan real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain
  reaction (RT-PCR). The ability to detect virus was not affected by the length
  of time pools were maintained under field conditions, although the CT score
  tended to increase with field exposure time. Furthermore, JE viral RNA was
  detected in three pools of 1,000 mosquitoes collected from Badu Island using a
  MM trap. These results indicated that a mosquito trap system employing self
  -powered traps, such as the MosquitoMagnet, and a real-time PCR system, could
  be used to monitor for JE in remote areas.

AB: Heavy metal pollution is known to be widespread in the sediments of the
  Lagoon of Venice. Therefore, physiological parameters influenced by this form
  of contamination were examined. The bivalve molluscs blue mussel (Mytilus
  galloprovincialis), ark clam (Scapharca inaequivalvis), and Japanese littleneck
  (Tapes philippinarum) were sampled in two sites (Marghera, Chioggia) every 3
  months for 1 year. The digestive gland and gills of each bivalve were analyzed.
  The concentrations of essential and nonessential metals (including chromium,
  manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, and cadmium) were determined.
  Because glutathione and metallothioneins (MTs) are involved in metal
  homeostasis and detoxification, their concentrations were evaluated in relation
  to metal concentrations. Results show that (1) all three studied species
  accumulate metals to a considerable extent, with some species-specific
  differences between the digestive gland and gills; (2) gills are a good tissue
  to evaluate pollution by examining the MT content. In particular, the
  correlation between Zn and MT levels in the gills indicates that M.
  galloprovincialis and S. inaequivalvis are sentinel organisms and can be used
  specifically for Zn pollution; (3) T. philippinarum accumulates Cu in the
  digestive gland more readily than the other two bivalves and therefore has the
  highest MT.

AB: Recent studies revealed that intestinal acanthocephalans of fish can
  accumulate heavy metals to concentrations orders of magnitude higher than those
  in the host tissues or the aquatic environment. This significant heavy metal
  accumulation by acanthocephalans, even surpassing that of established free
  living accumulation bioindicators, encouraged us to study the bioavailability
  of the platinum-group-metals (PGM) Pt and Rh for parasites. These precious
  metals are used in catalytic converters of cars for exhaust gas purification in
  Europe since the early 1980s. In addition to the beneficial effect in reducing
  the emission of CHx, CO and NOx of cars there is an increasing emission of
  these metals. However, it still remains unclear if these elements become
  accumulated in the biosphere and whether they affect the health of organisms.
  The present study reveals that in European eels (Anguilla anguilla) naturally
  infected with the eoacanthocephalan parasite Paratenuisentis ambiguus and
  experimentally exposed to ground catalytic converter material, the parasites
  take up and accumulate the catalytic active metals Pt and Rh whereas in the
  examined host tissues we found no metal uptake. Compared with the PGM
  concentrations in the water the worms contained 1600 times higher Rh and 50
  times higher Pt concentrations. Thus, the parasites can be used as sentinel
  organisms reflecting even very low levels of precious metals.

AB: Muscle concentrations of organochlorinated compounds as well as biliary
  levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) metabolites were determined in
  red mullet Mullus barbatus as a sentinel species for assessing the pollution
  along the western Mediterranean coast. A battery of biochemical markers[long
  dash]biotransformation and antioxidant enzymes[long dash]were also measured in
  liver subcellular fractions to assess exposure to pollutants. Among them, 7
  -ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity, as well as 7-penthoxyresorufin O
  -deethylase (PROD) activity and cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) content evidenced
  strong differences among sampling sites, and a good correlation with the amount
  of PCBs bioaccumulated by fish. No clear pollution-related response was
  observed for cytosolic glutathione S-transferase, whereas uridine-diphosphate
  UDP-glucuronyltransferase (UDPGT) was elevated in fish from polluted sites.
  Antioxidant enzymes[long dash]superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and
  glutathione peroxidase (GPX)[long dash]were used to assess oxidative stress.
  Among them, catalase activity was well related to PCB body burden.

AB: From a definition of the " biological indicator " concept, which covers very
  different uses (bio-monitoring, sentinel organisms, bio-informative species), a
  critical review of the significant contributions using Odonata is carried out.
  Autochtony of Odonata is discussed. Some synecoparsimony analyses are proposed,
  which expose a new method to study the relations between Odonata and
  macrophytes. These tend to show that this relation is not an association, but
  rather simply a " synecosis ", and that many problems do not authorize, in the
  current state of knowledge, to establish a reliable tool for description of
  hydrosystems bioassessment, resting on the only conjunction between freshwater
  macrophytes and Odonates. Complementary studies, including both the whole of
  the freshwater entomocoenosis for example, and analysis tools that do not
  introduce neither preliminary scenarisation (ad hoc hypotheses), nor
  methodological bias, must be undertaken as prerequisites to elaborate a
  biomonitoring tool for freshwater hydrosystems assessment.

AB: We determined the composition and organization of avian mixed-species
  foraging flocks during the non-breeding season from April to August 2000 in a
  high-Andean forest fragment of Polylepis besseri (Rosaceae) (3710-3880 m
  a.s.l., 11 ha) in Cochabamba, Bolivia. Forest birds were color-banded monthly
  starting December 1999. Sixty-three observations of flocks were made containing
  a total of 10 species with a mean ([plus or minus] SD) of 2.8 [plus or minus]
  0.9 species and 5.4 [plus or minus] 1.8 individuals per flock. The entire
  Polylepis bird community contained 30 core species. Since the forest was small,
  most flocks contained at least some of the same individuals. Three species
  occurred in > 70% (Giant Conebill Oreomanes fraseri Tawny Tit-Spine-tail
  Leptasthenura yanacensis, and White-throated Tyrannulet Mecocerculus
  leucophrys, with 2.6 [plus or minus] 0.6, 1.9 [plus or minus] 0.6, and 1.6
  [plus or minus] 0.5 individuals per flock respectively), one species (Asthenes
  dorbignyi with 1.4 [plus or minus] 0.5 individuals per flock) in 21%, and the
  remaining six species in [pound sterling] 5% of all flocks. All flock
  participants except one were insectivores. Individuals of O. fraseri showed
  high intraspecific group or pair fidelity and often, but not always, acted as
  flock leader, whereas the sentinel role was mainly assumed by L. yanacensis or
  A. dorbignyi. For the three species regularly associated with mixed-species
  flocks, home ranges of banded individuals observed in flocks were determined.
  Mean home ranges (100% minimum convex polygons) were 6.13 [plus or minus] 0.87
  ha for O. fraseri (n = 4), 2.13 [plus or minus] 1.26 ha for L. yanacensis (n =
  6), and 3.41 [plus or minus] 2.73 ha for M. leucophrys (n = 3). Intraspecific
  home range overlap was moderate to high in all species, clear associations of
  Tawny Tit-Spinetail and White-throated Tyrannulet individuals with one of the
  two Giant Conebill pairs/groups were lacking, and agonistic interactions were
  almost absent except in August. In other words, neither individuals nor flocks
  were territorial, and flocks were much more loosely structured than those
  studied in Neotropical lowlands, resembling in some respects mixed-species
  flocks in northern temperate zones. Selective advantages of mixed flocks in
  Polylepis forests are briefly discussed, finding support only for the predation
  avoidance hypothesis.

AB: This investigation involves the utilization of spectrofluorometric analysis
  lo estimate petroleum residues in fish and fish food from the Red Sea Coast of
  Yemen. The result, confirmed that all the site are contaminated to some extent
  with petroleum hydrocarbons. The concentration of petroleum hydrocarbons in the
  muscles samples ranged from 15.7 [mu] g/g at station RS-I to 63.9 [mu]g/g at
  station RS-IV, whereas sediment samples ranged from 1.2 [mu] g/g at station RS
  -I to 6.94 [mu] g/g at station RS-VI dry weight, expressed as kuwait crude oil
  equivalent. In order to characterize the extracted hydrocarbons some of the
  extracts were analyzed by capillary gas chromatography. The chromatograms
  showed that muscles and sediment extracts contained degraded hydrocarbons in
  addition to biogenic hydrocarbon components. It was concluded that the Red Sea
  fishes are subjected to the same point-source pollution of oil contamination as
  the life sentinel muscles. This pollution is a consequence of localized oil
  operations and or heavy ship traffic.

AB: The determination of field inactivation rates of oocysts in sludge and soil
  is important as many land applications use sludge as a means of fertilizing the
  soil. Approximately 2.5x105 oocysts were spiked into separate sentinel chambers
  containing a 1.0 g mixture of sludge and soil. The sentinel chambers were
  exposed to the soil surface environment for 60 days at a depth of 10 cm in
  order to evaluate the field inactivation rates of oocysts. The mass balance
  approach was used to determine the number of oocysts lost in the experiments.
  The results of the study showed that oocysts could survive environmental stress
  in soil. The mean inactivation rate of oocysts in the sentinel chambers at time
  intervals of 0 to 17 days, 17 to 30 days, 30 to 45 days, and 45 to 60 days were
  0.0045, 0.0033, 0.0043, and 0.012 day-1, respectively. Whereas, the mean
  inactivation rates of oocysts in control units at time intervals of 0 to 17
  days, 17 to 30 days, 30 to 45 days, and 45 to 60 days were 0.0023, 0.0019,
  0.0017, and 0.0025 day-1, respectively. An average of 4.8 percent of oocysts
  were lost in the experiments. Overall, the study demonstrated the presence of
  viable oocysts in sludge samples, which could potentially be used to fertilize
  agricultural land.

AB: Over the last three decades, special-purpose "entomological" radars have
  contributed much to the development of our understanding of insect migration,
  especially of the nocturnal migrations at altitudes of up to - 1 km that are
  regularly undertaken by many important pest species. One of the limitations of
  early radar studies, the difficulty of maintaining observations over long
  periods, has recently been overcome by the development of automated units that
  operate autonomously and transmit summaries of their observations to a base
  laboratory over the public telephone network. These relatively low-cost Insect
  Monitoring Radars (IMRs) employ a novel "ZLC" configuration that allows high
  quality data on the migrants' flight parameters and identity to be acquired.
  Two IMRs are currently operating in the semi-arid inland of eastern Australia,
  in a region where populations of migrant moths (Lepidoptera) and Australian
  plague locusts Chortoicetes terminifera (Orthoptera) commonly originate, and
  some examples of outputs from one of these units are presented. IMRs are able
  to provide the data needed to characterize a migration system, i.e. to estimate
  the probabilities of migration events occurring in particular directions at
  particular seasons and in response to particular environmental conditions and
  cues. They also appear capable of fulfilling a "sentinel" role for pest
  -management organisations, alerting forecasters to major migration events and
  thus to the likely new locations of potential target populations. Finally, they
  may be suitable for a more general ecological monitoring role, perhaps
  especially for quantifying year-to-year variations in biological productivity.

AB: The egg parasitoid Trichogramma brassicae Bezdenko was introduced from
  Moldavia to western Europe some 30 years ago and since then has been
  inundatively released to control the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis
  Hubner, in maize. We investigated parasitism of non-target butterfly eggs by T.
  brassicae in field cages and under field conditions in Switzerland. Parasitism
  of eggs (exposed for 24 h) of six non-target species (Papilio machaon L.,
  Clossiana selene Denis and Schiffermuller, Maniola jurtina L., Melanargia
  galathea L., Hipparchia alcyone Denis and Schiffermuller, Cyaniris semiargus
  Rottemburg) in field cages of 2x2x2 m ranged between 2.5 and 18.7% when based
  on a relative high number of released parasitoid females (780[plus or minus]273
  SD/cage). This number is 16-fold more compared to agricultural practices
  (120,000/ha). As a control, Ephestia kuehniella Zeller eggs were glued on the
  same plant. A difference in parasitism rates between the non-target species and
  E. kuehniella was only observed for M. galathea. During inundative releases of
  T. brassicae in maize, sentinel eggs of two suitable non-target hosts and of E.
  kuehniella were exposed for 72 h. Parasitism rates of E. kuehniella egg masses
  inside maize fields averaged 40% compared to significantly lower parasitism
  rates of 26.2 and 12.6% for eggs of H. alcyone and M. galathea. At 2 m distance
  from the maize field, parasitism rates decreased to 2.3% for M. galathea, 6.1%
  for H. alcyone, and 9.8% for E. kuehniella while no single egg was found
  parasitized at 20 m distance from the release fields. We conclude that,
  although the tested non-target butterflies were all attacked under semi-field
  and field conditions, effects on non-target butterflies due to mass released T.
  brassicae are minimal.

AB: Habitat use by sexually dimorphic Bar-tailed Godwits (Limosa lapponica) was
  examined in an Australian estuary during the midwintering (November-December)
  and premigratory (March) periods of a nonbreeding season. In an area with two
  available habitats, Zostera seagrass beds and unvegetated sand flats, males
  occurred almost exclusively in seagrass, whereas the females occurred at equal
  densities in both habitats. Estimates of intake rates seemed greater for
  individuals foraging in seagrass (0.114-0.128 g dry mass (DM)[center dot]min-1)
  than on sand (0.064-0.087 g DM[center dot]min-1). Males appeared less well
  adapted for foraging on sand than in seagrass, and the presence of females
  could interfere with males' foraging on sand. The reason for the equal
  distribution of the females between the habitats probably lies in the inability
  of one particular habitat to support the entire population of females. Little
  interhabitat movement by individuals was detected. Within a habitat, sexes
  moved synchronously at the 1-ha scale but showed a degree of segregation at the
  individual scale, suggesting that some avoidance existed. Three diet types were
  observed in the godwits in the area: (1) dominated by soldier crabs (Mictyris
  longicarpus) on sand, (2) dominated by sentinel crabs (Macrophthalmus spp.) in
  seagrass, and (3) dominated by soft-bodied prey in seagrass.

AB: An investigation involving raccoons as a sentinel species at the Paducah
  Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP) and Ballard Wildlife Management Area in western
  Kentucky (USA) delineated the extent of exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls
  (PCBs). Three separate measures of hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) induction were
  used to evaluate raccoon physiological responses to PCB exposure. Hepatic CYP
  induction was estimated via determination of total CYP, dealkylase activities,
  and immunoreactive proteins. There were no differences in raccoon biomarker
  responses between study sites. Significant relationships between and among PCB
  residues and biomarkers indicated that hepatic CYP induction had occurred in
  response to PCB exposure. Pentoxy-resorufin O-deethylase (PROD) activity,
  CYP1A1, and CYP1A2 were biomarkers most closely associated with PCB exposure.
  The rank order of responses was CYP1A1 > CYP1A2 > PROD > ethoxyresorufin O
  -deethylase (EROD) as related to raccoon liver PCB concentrations, whereas the
  order was CYP1A1 > PROD > EROD > CYP1A2 when regressed with total PCB
  concentrations in abdominal fat.

AB: An investigation involving raccoons (Procyon lotor) as a sentinel species at
  the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP) in Western Kentucky (USA) delineated
  the extent of exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and PCB spatial
  distribution. Raccoon exposure to PCBs was demonstrated through analysis of
  subcutaneous fat, abdominal fat, liver, and brain tissues from raccoons
  collected at the PGDP but also was clearly evident in raccoons from a reference
  area situated along the Ohio River (USA). Raccoons with the highest tissue PCB
  concentrations appeared to be those inhabiting areas nearest the plant itself
  and most likely those that ventured into the plants interior. Male raccoons at
  the PGDP had similar concentrations of total PCBs in subcutaneous fat (1.86
  [plus or minus] 0.64 [mu]g/g) as males from the reference site (1.41 [plus or
  minus] 0.35 [mu]g/g), but females had higher PCB body burdens than those at the
  reference site (9.90 [plus or minus] 6.13 [mu]g/g vs 0.75 [plus or minus] 0.40
  [mu]g/g). Gross measurements of exposure to radiation-producing materials
  revealed that counts per minute exceeded background in 61% of PGDP raccoons
  compared with 27% at the reference site and five raccoons at the PGDP had beta
  counts that were more than twice the background. Differences among trapping
  success, growth rates, and serum chemistry parameters were noted but may have
  been related to habitat and other environmental and population density factors.

AB: Echinococcus granulosus is shown to occur in eastern Finland in a sylvatic
  cycle involving wolves (Canis lupus) as the definitive host and reindeer
  (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) and probably also elk (Alces alces) and the wild
  forest reindeer (Rangifer tarandus fennicus) as intermediate hosts. Even though
  the prevalence of E. granulosus in reindeer has increased in recent years, it
  is still very low (<0.013%). The results suggest, however, that the reindeer is
  a good sentinel animal to show the contamination of soil with Echinococcus
  eggs. This is the first report of wolves acting as a definitive host for E.
  granulosus in northern Europe. The parasite seems to be quite common in the
  Finnish wolf population, with a prevalence of approximately 30% in both
  intestinal and faecal samples. The present results and previous ones indicate
  that E. granulosus infection has not spread to dogs in the reindeer herding
  area.

AB: Previous research suggests that free metal concentrations in soils are the
  best correlate of the proportion available for uptake, especially by plants.
  The same may be true for animals which ingest soil, such as earthworms and
  gastropod molluscs. Using predictions from a simple model proposed by Sauve et
  al. [Environ. Pollut. (1997) 149] and based on soil pH and total soil
  concentrations, the relationship between free soil Pb and soft tissue Pb
  concentrations is evaluated in the garden snail Helix aspersa. Five replicate
  adults collected from 23 sites in England and Wales were partitioned into two
  tissue fractions and the relationship between their Pb concentrations and those
  of their native soil was examined using simple regression analysis. Levels in
  both fractions rose with free Pb concentrations, but the terms of each
  relationship and its level of significance were greatly influenced by the most
  contaminated soils. Neither tissue fraction served as an effective sentinel of
  free soil Pb and the regression coefficient was a poor summary statistic across
  sites with a large range of contamination. The same was true of Pb
  concentrations in the whole soft tissues. It may be that free ion
  concentrations are not indicative of metal availability to animals with a range
  of mechanisms to assimilate nutrients, perhaps because of undescribed
  environmental and physiological factors governing assimilation or limiting soft
  tissue concentrations.

AB: Epizootic avian vacuolar myelinopathy (AVM) was first recognized as a
  neurologic disease in bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and American coots
  (Fulica americana) in Arkansas, USA in 1994 and 1996, respectively, but
  attempts to identify the etiology of the disease have been unsuccessful to
  date. Between 1998 and 2001, wing clipped sentinel birds (wild American coots
  and game farm mallards [Anas platyrhynchos]) were released at Lake Surf, North
  Carolina, a lake with recurrent outbreaks of AVM, in order to gain a better
  understanding of the epizootiology of the disease. As early as 5-7 days post
  -release, sentinel coots and mallards showed neurologic signs of disease and
  were confirmed with AVM upon histologic examination of their brains. Serial
  releases of sentinel mallards during the summer, fall, and winter of 2000-01
  demonstrated that exposure to the causative agent at a threshold sufficient to
  manifest disease was seasonal and occurred over about a 2 mo period, during
  November and December. Our findings that disease onset can be very rapid (5-7
  days) and that exposure to the causative agent of AVM is site-specific,
  seasonal (late fall to early winter), and occurs over a relatively short
  duration (several months) supports the hypothesis that the disease is caused by
  a chemical substance, most likely of natural origin.

AB: Identifying the presence of bovine tuberculosis (TB; Mycobacterium bovis) in
  wildlife is crucial in guiding management aimed at eradicating the disease from
  New Zealand. Unfortunately, surveys of the principal wildlife host, the
  introduced brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), require large samples
  (>95% of the population) before they can provide reasonable confidence that the
  disease is absent. In this study, we tested the feasibility of using a more
  wide-ranging species, feral pig (Sus scrofa), as an alternative sentinel
  capable of indicating TB presence. In January 2000, 17 pigs in four groups were
  released into a forested area with a low density of possums in which TB was
  known to be present. The pigs were radiotracked at 2 wk intervals from February
  to October 2000, and some of them were killed and necropsied at various
  intervals after release. Of the 15 pigs successfully recovered and necropsied,
  one killed 2 mo after release had no gross lesions typical of TB, and the only
  other pig killed at that time had greatly enlarged mandibular lymph nodes. The
  remainder were killed at longer intervals after release and all had gross
  lesions typical of TB. Mycobacterium bovis was isolated from all 15 pigs by
  mycobacterial culture. Home range sizes of pigs varied widely and increased
  with the length of time the pigs were in the forest, with minimum convex
  polygon range-size estimates averaging 10.7 km2 (range 4.7-20.3 km2) for the
  pigs killed after 6 mo. A 6 km radius around the kill site of each pig would
  have encompassed 95% of all of their previous locations at which they could
  have become infected. However, one pig shifted 35 km, highlighting the main
  limitation of using unmarked feral pigs as sentinels. This trial indicates use
  of resident and/or released free-ranging pigs is a feasible alternative to
  direct prevalence surveys of possums for detecting TB presence.

AB: The range of the native butterfly Pieris virginiensis Edwards has decreased
  in New York and Ontario since the 1940s. Loss of habitat and harm from Cotesia
  glomerata (L.), a braconid parasitoid introduced to North America in the late
  nineteenth century for biological control of the invasive pest butterfly Pieris
  rapae (L.), have been suggested as the causes of this decline. In western
  Massachusetts, extensive habitat suitable for P. virginiensis remains and its
  principal host plant, Cardamine diphylla, is common. We found P. virginiensis
  to be widely present, occurring at 39% of host plant patches. In laboratory
  tests, we found that both C. glomerata and Cotesia rubecula (Marshall) are able
  to parasitize and successfully develop in P. virginiensis larvae when these are
  presented on detached leaves of C. diphylla. However, when we exposed
  laboratory-reared first or second instars of either P. rapae or P. napi (both
  suitable hosts for these Cotesia spp.) as sentinel larvae on leaves of either
  Brassica oleracea or C. diphylla at sites where P. virginiensis was present, no
  parasitism by either Cotesia sp. was detected. Some sentinel larvae were
  parasitized by an unidentified ichneumonid in the genus Hyposoter. We conclude
  that in western Massachusetts, P. virginiensis is widely distributed at low
  densities and that while it is physiologically an acceptable and suitable host
  for both C. glomerata and C. rubecula, larvae of field populations of this
  butterfly are not attacked because these parasitoids do not forage in forested
  habitats, even when they are locally present in adjacent meadows. Consequently,
  we report that this butterfly is not threatened by these parasitoids contrary
  to early suggestions in the literature.

AB: It recently became clear that acanthocephalans parasitizing mammals can
  bioconcentrate several heavy metals to conspicuously higher concentrations than
  the tissues of their definitive hosts. As cestodes are more abundant in
  terrestrial animals than acanthocephalans, and thus potentially more useful in
  attempts toward passive as well as active biomonitoring, a very common tapeworm
  and its synanthropic mammalian host were selected for the present study. The
  tapeworm Hymenolepis diminuta and experimentally infected male Wistar rats of
  the CD-M-strain were investigated with respect to their lead accumulation. The
  worms were allowed to grow up for five weeks post infection followed by a five
  weeks oral lead exposure of the rats. After the exposure period the rats were
  killed and the metal levels were determined in muscle, liver, intestine, testes
  and kidney of the rats as well as in the parasites. Lead concentrations were
  found to be 17 times higher in the cestodes than in kidney, whereas metal
  levels in all other host tissues were below the detection limit. Thus, this
  study reveals that lead accumulation also occurs in cestodes parasitizing
  mammals. Due to a lack of adequate sentinel species in terrestrial habitats the
  host-parasite-system rat-H. diminuta appears to be a useful and promising
  bioindication system especially in urban ecosystems.

AB: Fluorescent dust marking and sentinel pupal bags were used in 1998 and 1999
  to examine dispersal, spatial distribution, and duration of activity of mass
  -released Spalangia cameroni Perkins in a swine facility. In 1998, four
  releases were conducted in the period May-November and in 1999 a final release
  was completed in August. Males were observed in large numbers on window sites
  shortly after releases, whereas females seemed to remain in the environment.
  However, in one trial, and probably due to high air temperatures in the
  facility, a similar flight propensity toward the window sites was noted for the
  females. The distribution of parasitoids was clearly aggregated within a
  perimeter of 3 m from the release point. The duration of activity of marked S.
  cameroni, measured as the number of attacked sentinel pupal bags and
  parasitism, declined to a low level within 2 wk from the time of release. The
  results are discussed in relation to release strategies of S. cameroni in
  control of nuisance flies.

AB: The introduction of a St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLE) genotype new to
  southeastern California during 2000 was followed by focal enzootic
  amplification in the Coachella Valley that was detected by seroconversions of
  29 sentinel chickens in five of nine flocks of 10 chickens each, isolations of
  virus from 30 of 538 pools of 50 Culex tarsalis Coquillett females, and
  collection of 30 positive sera from 2,205 wild birds. This SLE strain over
  wintered successfully and then amplified during the summer of 2001, with 47
  sentinel seroconversions in eight of nine flocks, 70 virus isolations from 719
  pools of Cx. tarsalis and Cx. p. quinquefasciatus Say, and 40 positive sera
  from 847 wild birds. Human illness was not detected by passive case
  surveillance, despite issuance of a health alert during 2001. Virus
  amplification during both years was associated with above average temperatures
  conducive for extrinsic incubation and below average precipitation during
  spring associated with below average vector abundance. Seroconversions by
  sentinel chickens provided the timely detection of virus activity, with initial
  conversions detected before positive mosquito pools or wild bird infections.
  Vertical infection was not detected among Cx. tarsalis adults reared from
  immatures collected during the fall-winter of 2000, even though SLE over
  wintered successfully in this area. Early seroconversions by a sentinel chicken
  during February 2001 and a recaptured Gambel's quaff in April 2001provided
  evidence for transmission during winter and spring when ambient temperatures
  averaged below 17[degree]C, the threshold for SLE replication.

AB: Under controlled conditions we exposed eggs of 17 potential host taxa
  representing five orders and 14 families to females of Trichogramma platneri
  Nagarkatti, an egg parasitoid used as an inundative biological control agent
  against codling moth, Cydia pomonella L. (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae).
  Trichogramma platneri successfully parasitized species from five lepidopteran
  families (Gelechiidae, Noctuidae, Pyralidae, Sphingidae, Tortricidae) and the
  green lacewing, Chrysoperla carnea Stephens (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae). Female
  wasps spent more time on heavier host eggs and the probability of successful
  parasitism was related to the structural integrity of the chorion of the host
  egg. We observed oviposition attempts on all other lepidopteran hosts offered
  and on eggs of Geocoris punctipes Say (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae) and Nezara
  viridula L. (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae). Dipteran and coleopteran eggs were not
  attacked. Sentinel eggs of the six physiologically acceptable hosts were
  exposed in a walnut orchard in California during inundative releases of T.
  platneri and all hosts were attacked equally. Parasitoids were also equally
  active at all heights from 1.5 to 6.5 m within the orchard canopy. Inundative
  releases of T. platneri may impact naturally occurring populations of green
  lacewings within walnut orchards, and have the potential to impact nontarget
  lepidopteran populations within the release area.

AB: Suction traps (30 cm diameter) were more effective for non-attractant
  sampling of flying adult Culex tarsalis Coquillett than were smaller CDC (5.5
  cm diameter), Malaise or ramp traps. Comparative catch in suction traps
  operated in a variety of vegetation types indicated that females congregated
  along elevated ecotones and were significantly less abundant flying over low
  vegetation or under and over elevated vegetation. Most females taken at upland
  orchards or Tamarisk tree lines were unfed (97%, n = 5,278) and similar in
  reproductive condition to host-seeking females. Blood fed and gravid females
  and males were only abundant near emergence sites. Pyrocide 7396 (Pyrethrin 5%,
  PBO 25%) was applied at the label rate of 5 oz/min by truck mounted Pro-Mist
  ultra low volume (ULV) equipment and particle drift measured by bioassay. ULV
  particles dispersed well downwind over low vegetation, between citrus orchard
  rows, and under date orchard canopy, but did not penetrate citrus orchards or
  vineyards when rows were perpendicular to wind direction. Particles did move up
  and over vegetation contacting sentinel mosquitoes placed above the canopy. The
  congregation of adult mosquitoes at vegetative ecotones and within orchard
  vegetation may afford protection from ground applied ULV particles, negatively
  impacting control. These data may explain why repeated applications often fail
  to interrupt encephalitis virus transmission.

AB: A histopathological assessment of the gonad of male fish was performed as
  part of biological field studies carried out in coastal waters and small rivers
  in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, northeastern Germany. In the marine
  environment the eelpout (Zoarces viviparus) was selected as sentinel species.
  The three spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and perch (Perca
  fluviatilis) were chosen at freshwater locations. Histopathology of the testis
  revealed the presence of intersexuality in specimens of all three species. The
  intersex condition was defined by the simultaneous presence of primary oocytes
  within the apparently normal testis tissue. In comparison to stickleback and
  perch the eelpout exhibited the highest intersex prevalence and the most severe
  histological alterations. Fish with intersex were found at contaminated marine
  and freshwater stations as well as at sites with apparently little pollution.
  The findings suggest that feminised male fish were exposed to endocrine
  disrupting substances in the aquatic environment.

AB: The Madison River, Montana, is the site of a whirling disease epizootic
  among rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss caused by the parasite Myxobolus
  cerebralis. We investigated how the timing and location of the spawning and
  rearing of rainbow trout influences the risk of exposure to the parasite.
  Sentinel fish exposures were used to assess the spatial and temporal variation
  in disease severity in 1998 and 1999. Redd counts, radiotelemetry of spawning
  rainbow trout, and electrofishing estimates of fry abundance indicated that
  during the critical 2-3-month posthatch period, when rainbow trout are most
  susceptible to whirling disease, the majority of fry in the Madison River
  population are concentrated within a relatively small portion of the upper
  drainage. Disease severity ranged from low to very high in this area of the
  river. Large temporal variation in disease severity was also evident: severity
  was significantly higher in the spring than in the fall and in 1999 than in
  1998. These data indicate that the effects of whirling disease on rainbow trout
  populations are governed by a complex interaction between the timing and
  location of key life history events (spawning, emergence, and early rearing)
  and the spatial and temporal variation in the presence of the infectious stages
  of M. cerebralis. Life history diversity within rainbow trout populations may
  therefore help buffer the effects of whirling disease and help explain why
  population-level effects are so variable among infected populations.

AB: To date, there are no published MHC sequences from the California sea lion
  (Zalophus californianus), a thriving species that, by feeding high on the
  marine food web, could be a sentinel for disturbances in marine and coastal
  ecosystems. In this study, degenerate primers and RACE technology were used to
  amplify near-full-length (MhcZaca-DQB) and full-length (MhcZaca-DQA) expressed
  class II MHC gene products from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of two
  California sea lions in rehabilitation. Five unique Zaca-DQA sequences and
  eight unique Zaca-DQB sequences, all encoding functional proteins, were
  identified in the two animals, indicating the presence of multiple DQ-loci in
  this species. An additional three Zaca-DQB sequences containing features
  compatible with pseudogenes or null alleles were also identified. Despite the
  identification of multiple DQA and DQB sequences, the degree of heterogeneity
  between them was extremely low. To confirm the limited degree of Zaca-DQ
  nucleotide variation between individuals, we used denaturing gradient gel
  electrophoresis to examine putative peptide binding region sequences from the
  peripheral blood leukocyte-derived RNAs of 19 wild-caught California sea lions
  from physically distinct populations. The pattern of Zaca-DQ sequence migration
  was identical between individuals and independent of geographical region. This
  apparent Zaca-DQ sequence identity between sea lions was confirmed by direct
  sequencing of individual bands. In combination, these findings raise important
  questions regarding immunogenetic diversity within this thriving species, and
  should prompt further research into the existence of a highly polymorphic sea
  lion class II MHC molecule with sequence features that support traditional
  peptide binding functions.

AB: The presence of chemical contaminants in marine coastal waters is a major
  subject of concern since many molecules are potentially immunotoxic, even at
  low concentration. During the last decade, studies in sentinel species, such as
  the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, or the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, have
  revealed that immunosuppressive responses can be related to xenobiotic
  exposure, in the laboratory and in the field. In the present study, European
  flat oysters were experimentally exposed to heavy metals, to investigate
  possible alterations of their immune function. Several hematological and
  functional parameters of hemocytes were measured byflow cytometry, a technique
  allowing rapid, sensitive, cell-by-cell measurements in large cell populations.
  Results reveal a depression of phagocytosis and several subcellular,
  physiological changes in oysters exposed to cadmium and copper, suggesting an
  overall alteration of the phagocytic function.

AB: In the period 1997-2000, approximately 1,800,000 m3 of material dredged from
  the Port of Leghorn was discharged into a sea dumping site located 14 miles
  from the coast. The red mullet (Mullus barbatus) was used as a bioindicator
  species for monitoring the biological impact of these discharges on a
  geographical and temporal scale. Organisms were sampled over three years (1998
  -2000) at different stations and several biomarkers, both of exposure and
  effect, were analyzed. Bioavailability of specific classes of pollutants was
  evaluated by analyzing levels of metallothioneins, the activity of cytochrome
  P450 1A (CYP1A) and of glutathione S-transferases. Among biomarkers of effect,
  special attention was paid to the balance between prooxidant challenge and
  antioxidant defenses, and to the appearance of damage caused by oxidative
  stress. The analyses of the main components of the antioxidant system included
  superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidases, glutathione reductase,
  glyoxalase I and II, and total glutathione. These data were integrated with the
  measurement of total oxyradical scavenging capacity (TOSC) as an indication of
  the overall biological resistance to toxicity of different forms of oxyradicals
  (peroxyl radicals, hydroxyl radicals and peroxynitrite). Results indicated a
  biological impact in organisms sampled near the disposal site; the impact was
  particularly evident during 1999 and mainly related to organic chemicals such
  as PAH. Exposure to these pollutants also caused variations in the levels and
  activity of several antioxidants. The analysis of TOSC, however, revealed that
  the overall capacity of specific tissues of organisms to absorb various
  oxidants was not seriously compromised when challenged with increased
  prooxidant pressures. Variations of single antioxidants were useful in
  revealing early warning "biological responses", while integration with TOSC
  analyses indicated if such changes also reflect a more integrated and
  functional "biological effect" with possible consequences at the organisms
  level. The red mullet appears to be a useful sentinel species for a biomarker
  approach to monitoring impact caused by dredged materials.

AB: The microsporidian species Encephalitozoon cuniculi can infect a wide
  variety of mammals including man. It is a common parasite in rabbits and
  several sporadic infections in laboratory rats have been described. Based on
  molecular data three E. cuniculi strains have been identified. Here we describe
  the first in vitro propagation of E. cuniculi, which was isolated from a free
  -ranging rat (Rattus norvegicus). The rat was one of three seropositive animals
  among 23 rats captured in the city of Zurich. The new isolate was further
  characterised as strain II ("mouse"-strain) based on the rDNA internal
  transcribed spacer sequence. Western blot analysis of this isolate revealed
  slight differences to other available strain II isolates originating from
  laboratory mice and farmed blue foxes. The new isolate caused disseminated
  infection in liver and lung upon oral inoculation of Brown Norway (BN) rats and
  was transmitted to sentinel rats. This rat-adapted isolate will be valuable to
  study the pathogenesis of Encephalitozoon infections in the rat model.

AB: A total of 117 bird species has been recorded in Sehlabathebe National Park,
  south-east Lesotho, consisting of 29 vagrants, 18 visitors and 70 breeding and
  probable breeding residents. For each species status was determined and
  abundance roughly estimated. Quantitative studies on breeding bird communities
  were carried out by means of the line transect method on four transects with
  the total length ca 30 km in the park and on two transects with the total
  length of ca 20 km outside the park. In the park, dominant species were
  represented by the Stonechat Saxicola torquata, Ayres' Cisticola Cisticola
  ayresii, Yellow-rumped Widow Euplectes capensis and Wailing Cisticola Cisticola
  lais. Outside the park dominants were represented by Cape Weaver Ploceus
  capensis, Cape Sparrow Passer melanurus, Cape Canary Serinus canicollis, Common
  Quail Coturnix coturnix, Stonechat, Cape Butning Emberiza capensis and
  Drakensberg Siskin Pseudochloroptila symonsi. Characteristic, high-altitude
  species in the park included Drakensberg Siskin, Mountain Pipit Anthus hoeschi,
  Orange-breasted Rockjumper Chaetops auriantius, Banded Martin Riparia cincta
  and Sentinel Rock Thrush Monticola explorator. Species such as the Laughing
  Dove Streptopelia senegalensis, Sickle-winged Chat Cercomela sinuata, Mountain
  Chat Oenanthe monticola, Thick-billed Lark Galerida magnirostris, Red-winged
  Starling Onychognathus morio, Alpine Swift Apus melba, Cape Sparrow, Grey
  -headed Sparrow Passer diffusus, Red Bishop Euplectes orix and Golden Bishop
  Euplectes afer were absent or occurred in very low densities in the park,
  although they are widespread and common in the Maluti/Drakensberg grasslands
  (including areas neighbouring to the park). The lack of trees and shrubs for
  nesting, the lack of cultivated fields as feeding places and competition with
  related species both for food and nesting sites, may partly play a role in this
  regard.

AB: The interaction between soil types, temperature, and soil water potential
  may have differential effects on the survival of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts
  in the terrestrial environment. We examined the effects of three soil types (a
  silty clay loam, silt loam, and loamy sand), three temperatures (4, 20, and
  30[degree]C), and three soil water potentials (-0.033, -0.5 and -1.5 MPa) on
  the inactivation kinetics of oocysts. Sentinel chambers were filled with air
  -dried and sieved soil, brought to the appropriate soil water potential, and
  inoculated with 2[x]106 freshly purified oocysts. The inoculated chambers were
  buried in the same bulk soil at the appropriate water potentials and incubated
  at one of the three temperatures. Triplicate chambers were removed from the
  bulk soil on days 0, 22, 43, 84 and 156. Sentinel oocysts were extracted, and
  assayed for potential infectivity by the dye permeability method. Oocysts
  suspended in sterile distilled water and incubated with the sentinel chambers
  were used as controls for the effect of temperature. The soil water potentials
  investigated did not affect oocyst inactivation at any temperature or with any
  of the three soil types. Rates of oocyst inactivation increased significantly
  between 4 and 20[degree]C, but not between 20 and 30[degree]C with the
  exception of oocysts incubated in the silty clay loam. Oocyst survival appeared
  to be significantly greater in the silt loam soil than in the two other soil
  types when incubated at 20[degree]C; and at 30[degree]C oocyst survival was
  significantly less in the silt clay loam than in the other two soil types.
  Rates of sentinel oocyst inactivation at all three soil water potentials were
  significantly lower than the control oocysts in water at the three test
  temperatures. Thus oocyst survival in soil was not affected by the water
  potentials between -0.033 and -1.5 MPa; it was affected by soil texture; but
  temperature appeared to be the factor most affecting oocyst survival. In the
  critical ambient range of temperature in temperate climates oocysts may survive
  for months in agricultural soil, and pose a threat to surface waters.

AB: Acute effects of the endocrine disruptor bis(tri-n-butyltin) oxide (TBTO) on
  molting-hormone biosynthesis and imaginaldisc development were investigated in
  larvae of the midge Chironomus riparius (Meigen). Ecdysteroid synthesis was
  measured by 24-h incubation of molting-hormone-synthesizing tissues
  (prothoracic glands) in vitro with or without the addition of TBTO. The amount
  of ecdysteroids produced was analyzed by radioimmunoassay. Developmental
  effects in vivo were investigated by determining the developmental phase of the
  genital imaginal discs before and after a 48-h exposure to TBTO in water. Sex
  -specific effects were found with both endpoints. Ecdysteroid synthesis was
  significantly reduced (analysis of variance [ANOVA], p[ltoreq]0.005) in female
  larvae at all concentrations (TBTO-Sn at 50, 500, and 5,000 ng/L), whereas a
  significant elevation of the biosynthesis rate occurred in male larvae in the
  500-ng/L treatment (ANOVA, p[ltoreq]0.05). In vivo experiments with development
  of the genital imaginal disc within a 48-h exposure period revealed a
  significantly slower development in female larvae and a significantly faster
  development in male larvae (contingency tables, p[ltoreq]0.001) at all
  concentrations tested (TBTO-Sn at 10, 50, 200, and 1,000 ng/L). These results
  partly coincided with the in vitro effects on molting-hormone synthesis. The 48
  -h median lethal concentration (LC50) was 25 [mu]g/L (20-30 [mu]g/L 95%
  confidence intervals). The combination of in vitro and in vivo methods has
  proven to be a useful approach for the detection of endocrine effects of TBTO
  in C. riparius at levels 2,000-fold below the LC50 value. High sensitivity and
  short test duration suggest that chironomids may have potential as freshwater
  sentinel organisms for endocrine-disrupting chemicals.

AB: The fact that raccoons (Procyon lotor) are an opportunistic omnivore has
  severely complicated interpretations of contaminant uptake patterns due to the
  inability to determine the trophic position an individual occupies. Moreover,
  few studies have examined the relationships between heavy metal bioaccumulation
  and trophic structure, especially in the terrestrial environment. In this
  study, the stable isotopes of nitrogen were used to characterize the feeding
  habits of the raccoon at the population level and to determine whether metal
  burden was related to trophic feeding structure within a well-defined
  ecosystem. Raccoon populations were isotopically distinct, and significant
  positive relationships existed between some trace element contents and
  [delta]15N of muscle when site was used as a covariable in a statistical model.
  Although the transfer of metals through terrestrial ecosystems is complex, our
  study showed that some of the variation in contaminant body burdens in raccoon
  populations can be attributed to trophic feeding position and that 15N/14N
  ratios of muscle tissue provide a quantitative measure of this process. The
  potential for using omnivores such as the raccoon, as a sentinel species for
  contaminant studies, should be explored further since the ambiguity of the
  relative trophic level an animal occupies can be directly estimated. This
  provides a more extensive sampling across trophic levels using a single
  species, which can have broad consequences for ecological risk assessments.

AB: Butyltins (BTs) were measured in 2 species of shellfish and 16 species of
  fish collected along the Korean coast. Tributyltin (TBT) was detected in the
  mussels and oysters of sentinel organisms (20 to 940 ng Sn/g dry wt),
  indicating widespread contamination of TBT in the Korean coast. The elevated
  concentrations of TBT in the shellfish found in the sites near harbors or
  shipyards suggests that antifouling paints are probable major sources of
  butyltins in these areas. The TBT compound was detected in 12 out of 16 fish
  samples. The concentrations of TBT in fish muscles were between 7 and 151 ng
  Sn/g dry wt, while the level in whole body of anchovy was very high (793 ng
  Sn/g dry wt). Exposure doses to Korean people via consumption of these marine
  products were evaluated. The results suggested that the environmental levels of
  TBT were below the level of concern.

AB: 1. In order to realize the full potential of natural enemies in integrated
  pest management, it is necessary to understand their population dynamics,
  particularly in relation to the role of refuges. Harvested and unharvested
  plots were established in a commercial hay lucerne Medicago sativa crop and the
  potential for the unharvested vegetation to constitute a refuge for natural
  enemies of Helicoverpa spp., one of the key pests, was evaluated. 2. The
  temporal and spatial dynamics of arthropod populations were evaluated using
  sequential samples from directional traps (pitfall and Malaise) and vacuum
  sampling in both crop treatments. 3. The spatial dynamics of predation were
  measured using 'sentinel' cards baited with Helicoverpa spp. eggs. 4. There was
  no significant directional movement of arthropods captured in pitfall traps,
  except for a 3-day period immediately after harvest when there was a net
  movement of the natural enemies Dicranolaius bellulus, Carabidae adults,
  spiders and the phytophagous mite Halotydeus destructor from harvested to
  unharvested plots. 5. There was net movement of adult Netelia producta, D.
  bellulus, Coccinella transversalis and Syrphidae as well as the pest
  Helicoverpa spp. from harvested to unharvested plots for 24 h following a
  harvest. 6. Densities of D. bellulus and C. transversalis within unharvested
  plots decreased with increasing distance from the borders with harvested plots.
  7. Predation rates of Helicoverpa eggs placed in unharvested plots were broadly
  consistent with predator densities and decreased with distance from the
  harvested plots. 8. Predation rates of Helicoverpa eggs placed in harvested
  plots declined with increasing distance from unharvested plots, suggesting that
  natural enemies from the latter dispersed into regrowing lucerne. 9. Strips
  narrower than the plot width used (30 m) may be adequate to accommodate natural
  enemies displaced by harvesting. Unharvested refuge strips should ideally be
  spaced less than 30 m apart so that the natural enemies can contribute to
  biological control of pests over the entire width of harvested strips.

AB: Two species of bivalves, Mya arenaria and Mactromeris polynima, were exposed
  to contaminated marine sediments from Baie des Anglais, Quebec, for a period of
  10 and 12 weeks, respectively, in order to determine if there was an effect on
  the phagocytic activity of hemocytes from each species. These sediments contain
  elevated levels of both PAHs and PCBs. Uncontaminated beach sand was used as
  control sediments. After a period of 4 weeks, each species of bivalves were
  sampled and hemocyte phagocytic activity was monitored by flow cytometry. While
  phagocytosis by hemocytes from M. polytiyma was significantly suppressed, those
  from M. arenaria were not different from beach sand-exposed controls. At the
  end of the exposure period, the phagocytic activity of hemocytes from both
  species was suppressed. Physiological parameters such as mantle proteins or
  malondialdehyde levels, total protein and total glycogen levels in the
  digestive gland were not affected by exposure to contaminated sediments.
  Moreover, the suppression of phagocytosis was well correlated with the transfer
  of contaminants from the sediments to the bivalves and their subsequent
  bioaccumulation, as demonstrated by the PCB body burden. These results support
  the use of bivalves as good sentinel species to survey sediment contamination
  and the usefulness of hemocyte phagocytic activity as a sensitive biomarker of
  exposure to organic contaminants.

AB: The objective of this study was to identify likely proximate cues to the
  seasonal migrations of cod, Gadus morhua L., in the southern Gulf of St
  Lawrence. We computed a migration timing index across several years using
  commercial fishery (1970-1992) and sentinel survey (1995-1999) catch rate data,
  and closely monitored the seasonal changes in temperature, dissolved oxygen,
  food intake, and energy stores between 1995 and 1998. The inter-year
  variability in the timing of the seasonal migrations was relatively low (s.d.=8
  d for spring migration, 10 d for autumn migration), suggesting that photoperiod
  was involved in the control mechanism of migration. However, other factors were
  also implicated in the control mechanism, given that cod initiated the autumn
  migration progressively earlier in the late 1980s and 1990s. At the onset of
  the autumn migration, dissolved oxygen concentrations were above levels known
  to induce avoidance behaviour in this species, and food resources were
  considered to be relatively abundant. Similarly, cod did not initiate the
  autumn migration at a specific temperature or following a particular
  temperature regime experienced during summer. However, cross correlation
  function analysis indicated that a widespread cooling of near bottom waters
  preceded the mid-1980s shift in migration timing by one to two years,
  suggesting that the cooling event was linked in some way to the change in
  migration dates. Other correlations showed that the earlier migrations
  coincided with older cod becoming more abundant and smaller in size, and also
  with their principal fish prey (herring and capelin) increasing in number.
  These results suggest that older cod played a key role in launching the early
  autumn migrations. One plausible interpretation is that their decline in body
  size and lipid-rich diets led to a rapid build up of energy reserves over
  summer grounds, and thus to an earlier readiness to engage in the autumn
  migration. We discuss the potential impact of earlier departures on stock
  productivity.

  In this study, perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS; C8F17SO3-),
  perfluorooctanesulfonamide (FOSA; C8F17SO2NH2), perfluorohexane-sulfonate
  (PFHxS; C6F13SO3-), and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA; C7F15CO2-) were measured in
  livers of mink and river otters collected from various locations in the United
  States. PFOS was found in all mink livers analyzed. Frequencies of occurrence
  of FOSA, PFHxS, and PFOA were less. The greatest concentration of PFOS measured
  in liver of mink was 5140 ng/g, wet weight. Maximum concentrations of FOSA,
  PFHxS, and PFOA in mink livers were 590, 39, and 27 ng/g, wet weight,
  respectively. There were no significant positive relationships between
  concentrations of PFOS and PFHxS or PFOA in mink livers. Concentrations of PFOS
  were positively correlated with those of FOSA in mink livers from Illinois.
  There was no significant correlation between concentrations of PFOS and lipid
  content in mink livers. There were no age- or sex-related differences in the
  concentrations of fluorochemicals in mink livers. Greater concentrations are
  associated with those individuals collected near urbanized and/or
  industrialized areas. PFOS was detected in livers of all river otters collected
  from Washington and Oregon at concentrations ranging from 25 to 994 ng/g, wet
  wt.

AB: Natural enemies associated with eggs of Nezara viridula (L.) (Heteroptera:
  Pentatomidae) were evaluated by placing sentinel egg masses in weeds and
  cultivated tomato and bean crops in northern California. Egg predation was
  generally less than 10% and normally involved predators with chewing mouth
  parts. Predators seldom destroyed an entire egg mass, typically eating <40 eggs
  per exploited mass. Laboratory evaluation of >25 species of potential arthropod
  predators revealed that few fed on N. viridula eggs to any extent; however,
  numerous species fed on N. viridula nymphs. Five species of egg parasites were
  recovered from sentinel egg masses: Trissolcus basalis (Wollaston), Gryon
  obesum Masner and Telenomus podisi Ashmead (Scelionidae); and Ooencyrtus
  californicus Girault and O. johnsoni (Howard) (Encyrtidae). The major egg
  parasite was T. basalis, the only exotic member of the parasite guild; it
  typically parasitized 100% of the eggs in an exploited egg mass. The results
  indicate that parasitization of eggs and predation of small nymphs can be
  important biotic mortality factors for N. viridula populations in northern
  California. It is suggested that a combination of factors - viz., egg
  parasitization, nymphal predation, regional shortage of overwintering sites,
  and local shortages of suitable hosts - maintains this exotic pest at
  relatively low levels in the region.

AB: Although the effects of heavy metals on marine invertebrate species are well
  studied in term of their toxicity and bioaccumulation, less is known about
  their genotoxicity. The aim of this investigation was to assess the DNA
  damaging potential of cadmium (Cd) in an important pollution sentinel organism,
  the mussel Mytilus edulis. Cadmium is one of the most toxic and widespread
  heavy metals found in the marine environment, and is a recognised carcinogen in
  mammals. Based on the results of the comet assay (alkaline single cell gel
  electrophoresis), Cd was found not to be genotoxic in mussel gill cells under
  acute and chronic exposure conditions, whereas pre-exposure to low
  concentrations of Cd was found to enhance the genotoxicity of another mutagen,
  hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The effects of H2O2 were normally reversible when
  cells were transferred to clean saline buffer. However, in cells that had been
  pre-treated with Cd, in vivo or in vitro, we observed a decrease in this post
  -treatment DNA repair. The effects of Cd were reversed by zinc which suggests
  that the inhibitory effect of Cd on DNA repair was due to the displacement of
  zinc ions from active sites on proteins involved in the repair process (a
  property already described for mammals). Moreover, since Cd inhibits or delays
  the onset of apoptosis (programmed cell death), this removes one of the main
  defence mechanisms responsible for protecting the organism against neoplasia.
  There appears to be a close similarity between the effects of Cd on marine
  molluscs and mammals.

AB: The effect of prolonged exposure at two sites along the Reconquista River
  (Argentina), a highly polluted peri-urban water body, on brain
  acetylcholinesterase (AChE, EC 3.1.1.7, acetylcholine acetylhydrolase) of two
  teleosts was examined. Caged Cyprinus carpio and field-captured Cnesterodon
  decemmaculatus were used as sentinel organisms. Eserine concentration
  inhibiting 50% of AChE activity (IC50) and inhibition kinetic parameters were
  also evaluated. Interspecies IC50 differences were found to agree with observed
  kinetic parameters (KA, ki and kc), indicating that carps were more sensitive
  to eserine. Data obtained disclosed spatial differences and demonstrated the
  high sensitivity of AChE activity as an exposure biomarker. Marked species
  -related differences were detected, showing that enzyme determination of C.
  decemmaculatus is more effective in highly polluted sites. Considering the
  river water physicochemical profile, observed changes in AChE activities can be
  partly attributed to long-lasting raised concentrations of dissolved heavy
  metals.

AB: Late-spawning Fraser River sockeye salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka, stocks have
  suffered significant prespawn mortality associated with an unusually early
  freshwater migration pattern and the myxosporean parasite Parvicapsula
  minibicornis. Surveys of migrating adult salmon from several spawning
  populations were conducted in 1999 and 2000 to determine the extent of
  infection with P. minibicornis, when and where the parasite first becomes
  detectable during migration, and whether early migrating stocks might be used
  as sentinels to assess risk of infection in late-spawning stocks. Posterior
  kidney, preserved in 95% ethanol, was examined for P. minibicornis in stained
  histological sections and using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. The
  prevalence of this parasite in all Fraser River sockeye salmon stocks examined
  was high (range 47-100% infected). In contrast, P. minibicornis was not
  detected in the fish tested from the two sockeye salmon stocks outside the
  Fraser River drainage in either 1999 or 2000. The parasite was also not
  detected histologically or by PCR in the kidney tissue of the fish from the
  Fraser River that were sampled in salt water or early during their freshwater
  migration up the river. These findings and the progression in the prevalence
  and intensity of infection as the fish from three stocks (early Stuart, Weaver
  Creek and Cultus Lake) were monitored over time, suggest salmon acquired the
  parasite either in the lower Strait of Georgia or in the lower Fraser River
  before the confluence of the Harrison River. In both 1999 and 2000 the parasite
  was present in all Fraser River sockeye salmon stocks sampled, which suggests
  that early Stuart salmon may be valuable as a sentinel stock for the presence
  of the parasite in later-spawning stocks.

AB: Bucephaloides gracilescens is a common parasite in the intestine of the
  angler fish Lophius piscatorius, and the metacercariae have been recorded from
  a number of gadoid intermediate hosts. In a toxicokinetic study of lindane
  ([gamma]-hexachlorocyclohexane) in bullrout Myoxocephalus scorpius,
  metacercariae of B. gracilescens were found in the central nervous system
  (CNS). Furthermore, the metacercariae accumulated concentrations of lindane
  that were higher than in the surrounding CNS tissue. This is the first report
  of metacercariae of B. gracilescens in bullrout. In addition the present
  results contribute knowledge of the disposition of an important environmental
  contaminant in the metacercarial stage of a trematode that has been pointed out
  as a promising sentinel species of pollution in the marine environment.

AB: The aim of this study was to begin evaluating the utility of sand crabs
  (Emerita analoga) as an indicator species for the algal neurotoxin, domoic acid
  (DA), in Monterey Bay, California, USA, a site of recurrent blooms of the DA
  -producing diatom, Pseudo-nitzschia. One of the current sentinel organisms, the
  sea mussel (Mytilus californianus), has shown minimal or undetectable toxicity
  during some local bloom events. As a critical step in assuring the accuracy of
  DA determinations in E. analoga, we have developed and validated a highly
  efficient extraction protocol that yields toxin recoveries of
  97[plus/minus]2.9%. We also determined by HPLC-UV and receptor binding assay,
  with confirmation by LC-MS/MS, that sand crabs accumulated measurable amounts
  of DA during toxic Pseudo-nitzschia blooms, while the sea mussel showed no
  detectable toxin. In addition, a comparison of inter-animal variability in DA
  content revealed values ranging from ca. 0.5 to 5 [mu]g DA g-1 tissue and no
  consistent trend with size class, based on either animal weight or length.
  These data on the toxicity of individual animals will be useful in designing an
  appropriate sampling strategy for monitoring DA and, importantly, indicate that
  sand crabs do not appear to progressively bioaccumulate DA with age.

AB: This study compared the use of sentinel species-and community-based field
  approaches for assessing the biological status of fish living in a river
  receiving pulp and paper mill effluents. Three approaches were compared. Two
  approaches used sentinel species. One of these involved an internal/external
  examination of the fish that leads to the calculation of a fish health
  assessment index (HAI) and the other involved biochemical measurements of
  hepatic mixed function oxidase (MFO) activity and plasma steroid levels. The
  third approach characterized the fish community structure according to an index
  of biotic integrity (IBI). The comparison focused on how the methods respond to
  the hypothesis that recent process modifications/effluent treatment changes,
  resulting in demonstrable improvements in effluent quality, have beneficial
  effects on fish. Neither of the approaches using sentinel fish indicated clear
  mill-related influences either before or after the process
  modifications/effluent treatment changes. There was no evidence of depressed
  plasma steroids and increased MFO activity in fish frequently associated with
  mill effluent exposure in previous studies. While the HAI was higher at
  stations downstream from two mills, this could not be linked to effluent
  exposure alone. In contrast, the study of community structure showed a
  substantial improvement in fish assemblages at all the mill sites.

AB: Cooperative sentinel behaviour in Arabian babblers, Turdoides squamiceps,
  appears generally consistent with state-dependent models of individually
  selfish antipredator behaviour. We examined further detailed aspects of this
  cooperative behaviour, including the suggestion that by engaging in this
  behaviour sentinels advertise their status and gain social prestige. Chosen
  sentinel locations were higher, but no more exposed, than the best alternative
  locations within 25 m. Sentinels started off closer to the centre of the
  foraging group than when sentinel bouts were terminated. Change-overs between
  sentinels were nearly always due to previous sentinels terminating their own
  bout. On the rare occasions when bouts were interrupted by upcoming sentinels,
  physical contact or aggression was extremely rare. Dominant males tended to
  terminate sentinel bouts of other birds, interrupting especially the dominant
  females. Other than this, there was no effect of an individual's sex or
  dominance rank on any aspect of sentinel change-overs or location choice when
  acting as a sentinel. There were also no differences in any sentinel activity
  between simple family groups, and those more complex nonfamily groups within
  which individuals compete for reproduction. Rates of alarm calling did not
  differ between group members, although dominant males did make more territorial
  calls to neighbouring groups while acting as a sentinel. Therefore, we found
  relatively little evidence that individuals compete for the chance to act as a
  sentinel as a means of showing off within groups of Arabian babblers. Instead,
  our study confirms the primary function of sentinels as a system of cooperative
  vigilance.

AB: 1. Sentinel behaviour involves a unique cooperative system of dedicated look
  -outs which protect members of their social group from attack by predators.
  Using detailed observations from groups of Arabian babblers, Turdoides
  squamiceps, we tested the original theoretical suggestion that cooperative
  sentinel systems are simply the result of individually selfish state-dependent
  patterns of behaviour. 2. Sentinel effort and the number of sentinel bouts per
  individual per hour were greater for males than females, and both increased
  with individual dominance status within the group. 3. Sentinel behaviour was
  unaffected by group social structure, in terms of patterns of relatedness and
  the number of potential breeders. 4. Total group sentinel effort increased with
  group size, while the effort per individual decreased irrespective of sex and
  dominance rank. Simultaneous sentinel behaviour by two or more birds was very
  rare, but increased with group size. 5. Sentinel effort followed seasonal
  fluctuations in food availability, but not peaks of raptor migration through
  the study site. 6. Body mass was greater for males than females and was
  positively related to dominance rank. Overall, body mass explained much of the
  variation in individual sentinel effort both within and between birds. However,
  data on individual foraging performance could not be related to changes in body
  mass and thus to differences in sentinel effort. 7. Sentinel behaviour in
  groups of Arabian babblers therefore confirms many of the predictions arising
  from state-dependent models of cooperative, yet individually selfish, sentinel
  behaviour.

AB: Within the scope of the multidisciplinary research project Valimar (1995
  -1999), the present study emphasizes the use of histopathological
  investigations to evaluate the effects of the different chemical impact of two
  small streams on the general health and condition of the two sentinel fish
  species, brown trout (Salmo trutta f. fario) and loach (Barbatula barbatula).
  Parasitological investigations were also included to assess a possible
  relationship between toxicant exposure, parasitic load, and the occurence of
  histopathological organ changes. According to the multitiered approach of the
  Valimar project, fish from the field, individuals exposed to stream water under
  semi-field conditions, and fish from laboratory experiments were investigated.
  Under semi-field conditions, the histopathological responses in brown trout
  proved to reflect the different levels of contamination of the two small
  streams more clearly than those detected in loach. When captured from the
  field, both fish species revealed, in most cases, a higher degree of
  histopathological alterations than those individuals exposed at the respective
  site under semi-field conditions. Simulation of the toxic load of the more
  polluted stream in a laboratory experiment did not result in the same kind of
  tissue lesions in brown trout as in the field and semi-field investigations.
  Whereas results from the laboratory experiments could be specified as "toxicant
  -induced", the histopathological alterations in fish from both semi-field and
  field studies represent stress responses which integrate the effects of various
  abiotic and biotic stress factors including both toxicants and parasitic
  diseases.

AB: The effect of host weed phenology, abundance, and diversity and natural
  enemies on the population dynamics of the southern green stink bug, Nezara
  viridula (L.), in Hawaiian macadamia orchards was investigated. We found that
  the highest kernel damage occurred immediately following abrupt reductions in
  the flowering and fruiting stages of host weeds. Areas with the greatest
  diversity of host weeds showed higher damage, presumably because of higher N.
  viridula population levels. Predation rates on sentinel egg masses were highest
  over the two seasons in areas where the bigheaded ant, Pheidole megacephala
  (F.), comprised a large portion of the ant fauna. In one of the orchards, P.
  megacephala and the longlegged ant, Anoplolepis longipes (Jerdon), occurred in
  a spatial mosaic where the boundaries shifted back and forth over time.
  Sentinel egg masses placed in these two adjacent areas showed predation rates
  were highest in the areas dominated by P. megacephala, and intermediate in the
  interface zone and lowest where only A. longipes were found. The importance of
  weed phenology and natural enemy induced mortality is discussed.

AB: There is no existing formal, long-term program for gathering evidence of the
  incidence and severity of the health effects of toxic substances in wildlife.
  However, research-based studies of bald eagles, herring gulls, night herons,
  tree swallows, snapping turtles, mink, and beluga over the past 30 years have
  revealed a broad spectrum of health effects in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence
  basin including thyroid and other endocrine disorders, metabolic diseases,
  altered immune function, reproductive impairment, developmental toxicity,
  genotoxicity, and cancer. These effects occurred most often and were most
  severe in the most contaminated sites (Green Bay, Saginaw Bay, Lake Ontario,
  the St. Lawrence estuary, and more recently, Lake Erie), some of which are
  International Joint Commission-designated Areas of Concern (AOCs). In all
  cases, a strong argument can be made for an environmental etiology, and in many
  cases for the involvement of persistent organic pollutants, particularly
  polychlorinated biphenyls, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, and polycyclic
  aromatic hydrocarbons. For some, the association with particular contaminants
  is consistent with controlled studies, and in some, dose-response relationships
  were documented. The biologic significance of these health impairments to the
  affected species is currently unclear, but they resemble those observed with
  increased incidence in human subpopulations in one or more AOCs. Formalizing
  health effects monitoring of sentinel wildlife species by the parties to the
  Canada-USA Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement is required. This would
  facilitate the optimal use of sentinel wildlife health data in a larger,
  epidemiologic weight-of-evidence context upon which to base decisions and
  policies regarding the effects of chemical exposures on human populations.

AB: The flavivirus Iguape was isolated for the first time in 1979, from a
  sentinel mouse exposed in a forested area in Iguape County - SP, Brazil.
  Monotypic hemagglutination inhibition antibodies for Iguape virus were detected
  in domestic and sylvan animals, in Ribeira Valley region, Sao Paulo State.
  Monotypic antibodies have also been detected in human sera, although there is
  no evidence of clinical disease. The authors report the isolation of a new
  strain of Iguape virus from naturally infected mosquitoes. The study was
  conducted in May, 1994 in Juquitiba County - Sao Paulo State, in a forested
  area. Mosquitoes were captured by light traps After systematics identification,
  pools of mosquitoes were processed for virus isolation in suckling mice. An
  isolate (SPAr-158482) was obtained from Anopheles (Kerteszia) cruzii. Tests of
  Hemagglutination, Hemagglutination Inhibition, Complement Fixation,
  Neutralization in suckling mice and sensitivity to Sodium Deoxycholate were
  employed for identification of the isolate. According to tests of Complement
  Fixation, Hemagglutination Inhibition and Neutralization in mice, the virus was
  identified as the same as Iguape virus. This finding suggests that this species
  of mosquito may play a role in the transmission cycle of Iguape virus in
  natural environment.

AB: Freshwater nematomorphs, or gordiids, are parasitic as larvae, but free
  -living in aquatic environments as adults. Studies based on the collection of
  adults have reported gordiids to be widespread, but discontinuous in
  distribution. However, a relatively short adult life span and unknown life
  history make the detection of adults difficult. An alternative approach to
  investigate gordiid distribution is to use cysts. Of all paratenic hosts,
  snails were chosen because they lacked internal defense reactions to the cysts
  and become easily infected. Here, it is reported that the occurrence of
  gordiids on the basis of the cyst stage is much more common than previously
  reported, thus altering the perception of how common these worms are. Using
  this modified survey procedure, gordiid cysts were found at 70% of sites
  examined, in an area where extensive sampling over 3 yr yielded adults only at
  a single site. Of 1,000 snails dissected, 395 were infected with gordiids
  (intensity range: 1-465). Furthermore, different types of human-modified
  landscapes did not affect gordiid distribution, suggesting that as urban and
  suburban areas sprawl, human encounters or pseudoparasitism with nematomorphs
  may increase. The results of this study indicate that use of organismal
  -specific sampling techniques can be critical in studies of parasite
  distribution and biodiversity.

AB: In order to use a sentinel organism to monitor hazardous trace metals in the
  marine environment, a reliable analytical procedure for the determination of
  trace metal concentrations in biological samples is necessary. A critical step
  of the trace metal determination is a sample digestion to solubilize metals. In
  order to develop a simple method of sample digestion using a commercially
  available laboratory microwave equipment, an acid combination (HNO3 and H2SO4)
  and microwave power-time program were examined with respect to recovery of
  reference materials. Using 1 g of reference material with 5 mL of nitric acid
  and 1 mL of sulfuric acid, Mn, Cd, Cu, Ni, Se, As, Sr and Zn were properly
  analyzed yielding the certified values within the analytical uncertainties, but
  Pb yielded a slightly higher values. The detection limit was 0.1, 0.1, 0.5,
  0.5, 1, 0.7, 1, 0.2 and 1 ppm for Mn, Cd, Cu, Ni, Se, As, Zn, Sr and Pb,
  respectively. This method was successfully applied to natural oysters and blue
  mussels collected from Tokyo Bay and Aburatsubo Bay.

AB: The dispersal behavior of Trichogramma ostriniae Pang et Chen, a potential
  biological control agent of European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis Hubner, was
  investigated in fields of sweet corn in central New York. The aims of the study
  were to quantify T. ostriniae dispersal, to determine whether they persisted in
  release fields, and what minimum number of release points per unit area would
  be adequate to ensure uniform distribution of the wasps for augmentative
  releases. Dispersal was monitored from central release points over distances
  from 35 to 230 m, in a square 9 ha grid of monitoring points, using yellow
  sticky cards and O. nubilalis sentinel egg masses to detect T. ostriniae.
  Results showed that the wasps dispersed rapidly, up to 180 m in 6 days and 230
  m in 21 days. The number of T. ostriniae captured on sticky cards and sentinel
  egg mass parasitism decreased with distance from point of release, although 11
  -40% parasitism of egg masses occurred in monitoring positions most distant
  from the release points. Uniform parasitism of sentinel egg masses was achieved
  in areas of 1-2 ha surrounding central release points. It is suggested that a
  single release point per hectare should be adequate to ensure uniform dispersal
  of T. ostriniae into sweet corn fields.

AB: Natural patterns of cooperative sentinel behaviour in Arabian babblers,
  Turdoides squamiceps, have proven consistent with state-dependent models of
  individually selfish anti-predator strategies. Here we demonstrate
  experimentally that sentinel effort within groups is determined simply by
  individual state. The two highest-ranking males in eight groups were separately
  fed a supplement of mealworms, each for one day at a time. Control days before
  and after each treatment confirmed that no carry-over effects occurred, and
  that most normal sentinel activity was carried out by alpha males, then beta
  males and then by the rest of the group. When supplemented, both alpha and beta
  males exhibited similar marked increases in sentinel activity, relative to
  control days. Unsupplemented males and the rest of the group incompletely
  compensated for these increases with reductions in sentinel effort. Differences
  in individual body mass within groups reflected natural and experimental
  variation in sentinel effort. Alpha and beta males weighed more than other
  group members, and gained mass only when supplementally fed. There was no
  evidence either for competitive sentinel behaviour, nor for any increased
  interference between males during the supplementation treatments. These results
  therefore provide strong evidence in support of the state-dependent approach to
  cooperative sentinel behaviour.

  12,000; 1997, n = 12,000), and Baton Rouge, Louisiana (1996, n = 12,257) were
  tested by a polymerase chain reaction and Southern hybridization-based test for
  the presence of third-stage larvae of the canine heartworm Dirofilaria immitis.
  Mosquito heads were pooled (1-200 heads) by month, locality, and species for
  testing. The test used was species specific for D. immitis and was capable of
  detecting DNA from a single larva in a pool of 200 mosquito heads. Specificity
  for the third larval stage was achieved by probing only mosquito heads. One or
  more D. immitis-infected mosquito heads were detected in each month of the year
  from Bartow in both 1996 and 1997. No infected mosquito heads were detected
  from Gainesville or Baton Rouge in December, January, February, or March. These
  results are in general agreement with previous sentinel dog and model
  prediction studies that showed heartworm transmission in the warm temperate
  Gulf coast region of the United States to be seasonal rather than continuous as
  previously believed.

AB: Parasites are attracting increasing interest from parasite ecologists as
  potential indicators of environmental quality due to the variety of ways in
  which they respond to anthropogenic pollution. In environmental impact studies
  certain organisms provide valuable information about the chemical state of
  their environment not through their presence or absence but instead through
  their ability to concentrate environmental toxins within their tissues. Free
  living invertebrates, notably bivalve molluscs, are commonly employed in this
  role as 'sentinel organisms' to monitor the concentrations of bioavailable
  metals in aquatic ecosystems. Also certain parasites, particularly intestinal
  acanthocephalans of fish, can accumulate heavy metals to concentrations orders
  of magnitude higher than those in the host tissues or the environment. The
  comparison of metal accumulation capacities between acanthocephalans and
  established free living sentinel organisms revealed significantly higher
  concentrations of several elements in Acanthocephalus lucii (Mueller) than in
  the Zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas) which is a commonly used
  bioindicating organism in Europe. In contrast to the high heavy metal
  concentrations recorded in adult acanthocephalans, the larval stages in their
  respective crustacean intermediate hosts show little tendency to accumulate
  metals. A number of experimental studies demonstrate a clear time dependent
  accumulation of lead for acanthocephalans in their final hosts. These
  investigations provide evidence that the extremely high metal concentrations in
  intestinal acanthocephalans of fish are not the result of a slow process of
  accumulation but instead a relatively rapid uptake to a steady-state level.
  Thus, metal concentrations in adult acanthocephalans respond rapidly to changes
  in environmental exposure of their hosts. The value of parasites for
  environmental monitoring will be discussed in detail in the present article.

AB: It recently became clear that adult eo- and palaeacanthocephalans
  parasitizing fish can bioconcentrate several heavy metals to significantly
  higher concentrations than the tissues of their definitive hosts. Following
  this discovery the lead accumulation of the archiacanthocephalan Moniliformis
  moniliformis was investigated using experimentally infected male Wistar rats of
  the CD-M-strain. The worms were allowed to grow up for 4 weeks post-infection
  followed by a 3 weeks oral lead exposure of the rats. After the exposure period
  the rats were killed and the metal levels were determined in muscle, liver,
  intestine and kidney of the rats as well as in different organs of female and
  male acanthocephalans. Lead concentrations were found to be highest in female
  M. moniliformis followed by the kidneys of the rats. Male worms contained
  approximately the same lead concentration as the hosts' kidneys. Lead analysis
  of the worms' organs revealed the highest lead concentration in the eggs of
  female acanthocephalans, followed by the cement gland of male Worms. Whilst the
  lead burden of the presoma was higher than that detected in the kidneys of the
  rats, the lead content of the metasoma was even lower than in the kidneys. A
  lead uptake of M. moniliformis from the intestinal lumen of the host became
  apparent as the faeces of infected rats contained significantly less lead
  compared to the uninfected conspecifics. Thus, this study reveals that lead
  accumulation also occurs in archiacanthocephalans parasitizing mammals. But the
  degree of metal bio-concentration is considerably lower compared to eo- and
  palaeacanthocephalans in fish. Anyway, due to a lack of adequate sentinel
  species in terrestrial biotopes the host-parasite system rat- M. moniliformis
  appears to be a useful and promising bioindication system especially in urban
  ecosystems in temperate regions.

AB: New techniques are presented on the use of 15N to mark insects. 15N, a
  stable isotope of nitrogen, was enriched above natural abundance in plant and
  insect tissues. Two laboratory studies demonstrated that enriched 15N
  -concentrations could be tracked from plant to insect using mass spectrometry.
  In the first study, adult Cotesia plutellae (Kurdjimov) (Hymenoptera:
  Braconidae) and Hippodamia convergens Guerin-Meneville (Coleoptera:
  Coccinellidae) were allowed to feed at the flowers of rapid-cycling Chinese
  cabbage plants that had been fertilized with 15N-enriched potassium nitrate
  (KNO3-15NO3). Both insect groups were found to have significantly elevated 15N
  levels after visiting the flowers of the 15N-enriched plants for 48 hours. In
  the second study, 15N-enriched bean plant (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) tissue was
  incorporated into an insect diet and fed to navel orangeworms, Amyelois
  transitella (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). When the navel orangeworm larvae
  were 4th instars, they were removed from the diet and exposed to the
  parasitoid, Goniozus legneri Gordh (Hymenoptera: Bethylidae). Results indicated
  that the enriched 15N-concentration of the bean plants was transferred to the
  navel orangeworms and, subsequently, to the parasitoids. This work may provide
  useful techniques to help establish whether agriculturally important
  entomophaga visiting 15N-enriched flowers or parasitizing enriched sentinel
  larvae in the field can be effectively marked with 15N.

AB: Farmed Atlantic salmon were used in British Columbia as sentinels to
  determine whether fallowing farms and previously infected channels would
  effectively eliminate infectious haematopoietic necrosis (IHN) virus from a
  region. The sentinel approach involved re-introducing salmon to a few
  strategically placed (sentinel) sites and subsequent monitoring for the
  presence of IHN virus over a specified period of time. Seven farmed Atlantic
  salmon sites with a history of infection were monitored for the presence of the
  virus for six months following a minimum fallow period of two months. After re
  -stocking, the virus was not detected in the sentinel fish, suggesting that the
  concentration of the virus in the area was not sufficient to cause disease in a
  species known to be highly susceptible to the virus. Specifically, transmission
  of the IHN virus from one year class to another may be prevented by fallowing
  sites between year classes. Similar models using farmed fish as sentinels may
  be useful for answering other environmental questions. Thus, fish farms
  themselves could act as monitors for the general health condition of a bay,
  inlet, strait, or other body of water in which the farms are situated.

AB: Several species of anuran amphibians have undergone drastic population
  declines in the western United States over the last 10 to 15 years. In
  California, the most severe declines are in the Sierra Mountains east of the
  Central Valley and downwind of the intensely agricultural San Joaquin Valley.
  In contrast, coastal and more northern populations across from the less
  agrarian Sacramento Valley are stable or declining less precipitously. In this
  article, we provide evidence that pesticides are instrumental in declines of
  these species. Using Hyla regilla as a sentinel species, we found that
  cholinesterase (ChE) activity in tadpoles was depressed in mountainous areas
  east of the Central Valley compared with sites along the coast or north of the
  Valley. Cholinesterase was also lower in areas where ranid population status
  was poor or moderate compared with areas with good ranid status. Up to 50% of
  the sampled population in areas with reduced ChE had detectable
  organophosphorus residues, with concentrations as high as 190 ppb wet weight.
  In addition, up to 86% of some populations had measurable endosulfan
  concentrations and 40% had detectable 4,4'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene,
  4,4'-DDT, and 2,4'-DDT residues.

  molluscs (Donax faba, Donax cuneatus, Scapharca inaequivalvis, Pinctada

  levels of 210Po among the tested species ranged from 65.8 to 2,668.9 Bq kg-1.
  Analyses indicated that the soft tissues of the bivalves registered a higher
  level of 210Po than the shells. Further, analyses also showed a non-uniformity
  in the distribution of 210Po in the various internal organs. The concentration
  recorded in them maintained the following descending order: digestive glands >
  viscera > gills > foot > mantle > shell. It is evident that P. indica could be
  used as a sentinel organism for 210Po in the ambient waters.

AB: Myxobolus cerebralis, the myxozoan parasite causing whirling disease in
  salmonids, was first detected in northeastern Oregon in 1986. To better
  understand the potential impact of M. cerebralis on resident and anadromous
  salmonids in this region, a series of studies was conducted in the Lostine
  River, where infected fish were first reported. Rainbow trout Oncorhynchus
  mykiss fry were exposed in sentinel cages for 14 d at five sites from near the
  river's mouth to the headwaters during the period from July 1998 to November
  1999. A subsample of exposed fry was assayed for the presence of DNA of M.
  cerebralis by polymerase chain reaction. Following four exposures, fish were
  held in the laboratory for 5 months of observation. The severity of infection
  in these fish was determined by histological examination, enumeration of spores
  isolated from the cranial cartilage, and observation of clinical signs.
  Sentinel fry became infected throughout the river from March to November,
  although the prevalence of infection increased in groups exposed in late
  summer. Infection prevalence was highest among fish exposed at the lower river
  site, ranging from 22.2% to 100%. Among fish held for 5 months, only those
  exposed in the lower river developed cranial lesions, whirling behavior, and
  black tail. The parasite's oligochaete host Tubifex tubifex was consistently
  identified only from the lower river site. Of the water quality measurements
  taken at each location, only conductivity correlated with infection prevalence
  (P<0.001). These data indicate that juvenile rainbow trout, steelhead (the
  anadromous form of rainbow trout), and chinook salmon O. tshawytscha, which
  emerge during times of peak infection, are exposed to M. cerebralis and are
  likely to become infected in this river.

AB: Previous studies have demonstrated no difference in micronucleus (MN)
  frequencies between wild rodents chronically exposed to the environmental
  radiation contamination of the Chornobyl (Ukraine) exclusion zone and those
  inhabiting reference populations. The aim of the present study was to test the
  hypothesis that a population of bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) has
  developed radioresistance as a result of 14 years of chronic, low-dose
  radiation exposure. Naive voles were placed in environmental enclosures in the
  Red Forest region of the exclusion zone for 30 d. Blood samples were obtained
  at regular intervals, and the MN assay was used to assess chromosomal damage.
  Additionally, radionuclide uptake was monitored throughout the study, and dose
  was documented for each individual as well as for their offspring. Total dose
  for the voles experimentally exposed in this environment averaged 1.09 Gy
  (36.20 mGy d-1) for the 30-d study period. Our results indicate that exposure
  to radiation levels well above regulatory statutes did not result in an
  increased MN frequency. Furthermore, our results do not support the hypothesis
  that voles chronically exposed to these radiation levels have developed a
  genetic basis for radioresistance that is unique from that present in naive
  populations. The use of C. glareolus as a sentinel species for environmental
  studies of radiation contamination and the question of whether the MN assay is
  an appropriate endpoint for studies of low-dose, chronic radiation exposure are
  also discussed.

AB: Temporal and spatial changes in the enzootic activity of western equine
  encephalomyelitis (WEE) and St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) viruses were monitored
  at representative wetland study sites in the Coachella, San Joaquin, and
  Sacramento valleys of California from 1996 to 1998 using three methods: (1)
  virus isolation from pools of 50 host-seeking Culex tarsalis Coquillet females,
  (2) seroconversions in flocks of 10 sentinel chickens, and (3) seroprevalence
  in wild birds collected by mist nets and grain baited traps. Overall, 74 WEE
  and one SLE isolates were obtained from 222,455 Cx. tarsalis females tested in
  4,988 pools. In addition, 133 and 40 seroconversions were detected in 28
  chicken flocks, and 143 and 27 of 20,192 sera tested from 149 species of wild
  birds were positive for antibodies to WEE and SLE, respectively. WEE was active
  in all three valleys, whereas SLE only was detected in Coachella Valley.
  Seroconversions in sentinel chickens provided the most sensitive indication of
  enzootic activity and were correlated with seroprevalence rates in wild birds.
  Avian seroprevalence rates did not provide an early warning of pending enzootic
  activity in chickens, because positive sera from after hatching year birds
  collected during spring most probably were the result of infections during the
  previous season. Few seroconversions were detected among banded recaptured
  birds collected during spring and early summer. Age and resident status, but
  not sex, were significant risk factors for wild bird infection, with the
  highest seroprevalence rates among after hatching year individuals of permanent
  resident species. Migrants (with the exception of mourning doves) and winter
  resident species rarely were positive. House finches, house sparrows, Gambel's
  quail, California quail, common ground doves, and mourning doves were most
  frequently positive for antibodies. The initial detection of enzootic activity
  each summer coincided closely with the appearance of hatching year birds of
  these species in our study areas, perhaps indicating their role in virus
  amplification. Bird species most frequently positive roosted or nested in
  elevated upland vegetation, sites where Cx. tarsalis host-seeking females hunt
  most frequently. These serosurveys provided important background information
  for planned host competence and chronic infection studies.

AB: Induction of heat shock proteins (Hsps) is often associated with a cellular
  response to a harmful stress or to adverse life conditions. The main aims of
  the present study were (1) to assess if stress-induced Hsp70 could be used to
  monitor exposure of the earthworm species Lumbricus terrestris to various soil
  pollutants, (2) to assess the specificity of pollutants in their tissue
  targeting and in Hsp70 induction, and (3) to evaluate if dose-response
  relationships could be established and if the stress-response observed was
  specific. The midgut/intestinal tissues of L. terrestris are shown to express
  an inducible member of the Hsp70 family after heat shock treatment in vitro and
  exposures to different soil toxicants in vivo (re: artificial soil). Short-term
  (24-72 hours) and long-term (14-16 days) exposures to the chemical standards
  chloroacetamide and pentachlorophenol and to heavy metals (Pb++, Cd++, Cu++,
  and Hg++) also affected the earthworms, and Hsp70 was induced in their
  midgut/intestinal tissues. After a 3-day exposure to heavy metals, the level of
  Hsp70 induction in the midgut/intestinal tissues appears to correlate well with
  the reported in vivo and in vitro toxicity data. Comparatively, in proximal and
  midbody wall muscle tissues of animals exposed to the heavy metals, a decrease
  in expression of Hsp70 was sometimes detected. Thus Hsp analysis by Western
  blot in L. terrestris tissues and particularly in the midgut/intestine proved
  to be a suitable and sensitive assay for adverse effects in earthworms and
  showed a good level of reproducibility despite some individual variations. The
  use of pristine/nonexposed animals transposed into contaminated environments as
  in the present study should therefore be of high ecological relevance.
  Induction of Hsp70 in earthworms should represent not only a good wide-spectrum
  biomarker of exposure but also a biomarker of effect since known toxicants
  altered gene expression in tissues of these animals, as contrasted with a
  simple accumulation of Hsp. Hence, the detection of Hsp70 in earthworms can
  constitute an early-warning marker for the presence of potentially deleterious
  agents in soils, with L. terrestris in particular and earthworms in general
  acting as potential sentinel animal species.

AB: The effects of Cu and Cd on functional responses of hemocytes in Tapes
  philippinarum, a Veneridae clam widespread in the lagoon of Venice, were
  evaluated. Bivalves were exposed for 7 days to various concentrations of
  CuCl2[cntdot]2H2O (0, 10, 60, and 110 [mu]g/L) and CdCl2[cntdot]H2O (0, 150,
  300, and 450 [mu]g/L). Hemocytes were collected from exposed clams, and the
  effects of Cu and Cd on phagocytosis, Neutral Red retention capacity,
  superoxide dismutase, and cytochrome oxidase activities were investigated.
  Hemocytes from animals exposed to Cu showed a significant decrease in
  phagocytic activity, whereas no inhibition was observed in cells from Cd
  -exposed animals. Diffusion of Neutral Red into the cytosol, an index of
  lysosomal membrane alteration, was enhanced by high concentrations of both
  metals. Different results in biochemical parameters were observed. Exposure to
  60 and 110 [mu]g Cu/L caused a significant reduction in hemocyte superoxide
  dismutase activity, whereas no changes resulted after Cd exposure. Increased
  cytochrome oxidase activity was observed in hemocytes from mollusks exposed to
  60 [mu]g Cu/L and 300 [mu]g Cd/L; no significant differences were found in
  cells from bivalves exposed to 110 [mu]g Cu/L and 450 [mu]g Cd/L. These results
  suggest a relationship between heavy metal exposure and alterations in
  functional responses of hemocytes in T. philippinarum and indicate that the
  type of observed effects vary with the nature and concentration of heavy
  metals. Moreover, the data obtained in the analyzed clam support the
  possibility of using it as sentinel organism in biomonitoring studies, even if
  used biomarkers will be further evaluated in field conditions.

AB: We used a simulated gizzard environment to examine the bioavailability of
  barium, cadmium, copper, lead and zinc to wild and sentinel mallards (Anas
  platyrhynchos) using a seasonally-flooded wetland. This impoundment was
  originally constructed as a containment area for dredged sediments which were
  contaminated through previous smelting operations. Extraction of elements from
  gizzard contents indicated that sentinel mallards experienced greater exposure
  to contaminants than their wild counterparts. Concentrations of the selected
  elements extracted from ingesta were lower than in seeds and sediments from the
  study site. Notable exceptions were barium and lead, which were not detected in
  seeds of some plant species, though the were present in the ingesta of one or
  more treatment groups. This technique may provide a more realistic means of
  estimating bioavailability and exposure than methods which measure total
  concentrations of elements in dietary components. The use of sentinel mallards
  may result in inflated estimates of risk to wild ducks using seasonally
  -available wetlands.

AB: Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus first appeared in Australia in 1995, when
  three clinical cases (two fatal) were diagnosed in residents on Badu Island in
  the Torres Strait, northern Queensland. More recently, two confirmed human JE
  cases were reported in the Torres Strait Islands and Cape York Peninsula, in
  northern Queensland in 1998. Shortly after JE virus activity was detected in
  humans and sentinel pigs on Badu Island in 1998, adult mosquitoes were
  collected using CO2 and octenol-baited CDC light traps; 43 isolates of JE virus
  were recovered. Although Culex sitiens group mosquitoes yielded the majority of
  JE isolates (42), one isolate was also obtained from Ochlerotatus vigilax
  (Skuse). Four isolates of Ross River virus and nine isolates of Sindbis (SIN)
  virus were also recovered from members of the Culex sitiens group collected on
  Badu Island in 1998. In addition, 3,240 mosquitoes were speciated and pooled
  after being anesthetized with triethylamine (TEA). There was no significant
  difference in the minimum infection rate of mosquitoes anesthetized with TEA
  compared with those sorted on refrigerated tables (2.8 and 1.6 per 1,000
  mosquitoes, respectively). Nucleotide analysis of the premembrane region and an
  overlapping region of the fifth nonstructural protein and 3' untranslated
  regions of representative 1998 Badu Island isolates of JE virus revealed they
  were identical to each other. Between 99.1% and 100% identity was observed
  between 1995 and 1998 isolates of JE from Badu Island, as well as isolates of
  JE from mosquitoes collected in Papua New Guinea (PNG) in 1997 and 1998. This
  suggests that the New Guinea mainland is the likely source of incursions of JE
  virus in Australia.

AB: Fish-eating birds are particularly subject to accumulation of persistent
  organic pollutants, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been shown to
  constitute a major hazard for this group of birds. Grey heron (Ardea cinerea)
  hatchlings from two rookeries were applied as sentinel species to study PCB
  burdens in coastal ecosystems in mid Norway and north Norway, and plasma
  retinol and dioxin-equivalencies ([SIGMA]TEQ) were applied to assess toxic
  effects of the PCB-burdens. The results show that grey herons appear to be
  amongst the fish-eating birds in Norway that are accumulating PCBs to the
  largest extent. There were no differences in [SIGMA]PCB or [SIGMA]TEQ in the
  yolk of grey heron hatchlings from the two rookeries and, accordingly, none in
  plasma retinol concentrations either. Furthermore, plasma retinol
  concentrations could not be related to [SIGMA]PCB or [SIGMA]TEQ. Thus, it seems
  that exposure levels are below the threshold for gross retinoid-related effects
  in grey heron hatchlings. There are also indications that the grey heron could
  be relatively insensitive to retinoid-related effects of PCBs. In the
  hatchlings with the highest pollutant levels, [SIGMA]TEQs were in the lower
  range of levels that have been associated with reduced hatching success in
  other fish-eating bird species.

  from the Japan coast and Uca vocans and Ocypode ceratophthalma, were examined
  electrophoretically for genetic variations in 13 enzymatic and one non
  -enzymatic protein comprising 17 loci. Most species were highly differentiated
  from each other (Nei's genetic distance, 0.29-1.63). The least genetic distance
  was found between M. japonicus and M. banzai, the genetic distinctiveness, of
  the two taxa being supported by three divergent loci with no common allele. The
  genetic relationships among Macrophthalmus species differed greatly from those
  inferred from morphological features, with a UPGMA tree suggesting that the sub

AB: We investigated some entomological factors underlying altitudinal prevalence
  variation in the Venezuelan Amazonia human onchocerciasis focus. Spatial and
  temporal variation in relative abundance, daily biting rate, proportion of
  parous flies, and monthly parous biting rate were studied for the three main
  simuliid vectors (based on their vectorial competence: Simulium oyapockense
  s.l. Floch & Abonnenc[apprxeq]S. incrustatum Lutz[mchlt]S. guianense s.l.
  Wise). Yanomami villages were selected among sentinel communities of the
  ivermectin control program, representing hypoto hyperendemicity conditions of
  infection. Spatial variation was explored via increasing village altitude on
  two river systems (A: Ocamo-Putaco and B: Orinoco-Orinoquito). Temporal
  variation was studied between 1995 and 1999 by sampling the biting population
  during dry and rainy months. Environmental variables included monthly rainfall
  and maximum river height. Simuliid species composition itself varied along the
  altitudinal and prevalence gradient. S. oyapockense s.l. prevailed below 150 m.
  Above this altitude and up to 240 m, S. incrustatum and S. guianense s.l.
  became more frequently and evenly collected along A but not along B, where S.
  incrustatum remained absent. The daily biting rate of S. oyapockense s.l. was
  higher during the dry season along A, whereas the converse took place along B.
  Daily biting rate of S. incrustatum was lowest during early rains. By contrast,
  the daily biting rate of S. guianense s.l. was highest during this period.
  There was a significant negative cross-correlation between proportion of parous
  of S. oyapockense s.l. and river height (2 and 3 mo lagged), whereas this
  variable (1 and 2 mo lagged) was positively correlated with the proportion of
  parous flies for S. incrustatum. Monthly parous biting rate values suggest that
  the months contributing most to onchocerciasis transmission in the area are
  likely to be the dry season and the transition periods between seasons.

AB: Vectorial capacity of Culicoides sonorensis Wirth & Jones for the
  transmission of bluetongue (BLU) virus was examined at a southern California
  dairy from January 1995 to December 1997. Insects were collected one to two
  times per week in five CDC-type suction traps (without light) baited with CO2
  at a constant release rate of 1,000 ml/min. BLU virus was detected in midges
  collected from May through December with an estimated overall infection rate of
  0.08%. The BLU virus infection rate of field-captured midges was not correlated
  with sentinel calf seroconversions to BLU virus. Sentinel calf seroconversions
  were highly seasonal, occurring from August through November with most calves
  seroconverting during September and October. Vector competence of field
  -collected nulliparous flies fed a locally acquired serotype of BLU virus in
  the laboratory was stable among years (17-23%). Vectorial capacity was strongly
  correlated with BLU virus transmission (measured by sentinel calf
  seroconversions) during 1995 and 1996, but not during 1997. Host biting rate
  estimated for traps nearest to the sentinel calves was the index best
  correlated with BLU virus transmission for all study years and was most highly
  correlated with sentinel seroconversions 4 wk later. The utility of vectorial
  capacity and its component variables is discussed for this system.

AB: A review is given of egg parasitoids (Hymenoptera Scelionidae,
  Platygastridae and Encyrtidae), associated with Metcalfa pruinosa (Say) or
  other Flatidae (Homoptera), that may be considered for evaluation as potential
  agents for biological control of this exotic planthopper in Europe. Egg
  parasitoid species of the same families, associated with Fulgoroidea other than
  Flatidae are also reported. A scelionid, Telenomus sp, crassiclava gr., bred
  from sentinel eggs of M. pruinosa in Texas (USA) in 1992, is the first certain
  record of an egg parasitoid from this flatid. A couple of other records in
  North America need further investigation. No native egg parasitoids are known
  to have adapted to M. pruinosa in Italy, except for a single case of a
  parasitized egg with an emergence hole. The low occurrence of egg parasitoids
  associated with M. pruinosa and the need for further research is discussed in
  order to evaluate the potential of such old associations and possible new
  associations with parasitoids of other Flatidae or Fulgoroidea.

AB: The garden snail (Helix aspersa) is currently used as bioindicator of
  metallic pollution. Our objective was to extend its use to organic chemicals by
  studying the effects and tissue concentrations of the organophosphorus
  pesticide dimethoate following dietary uptake. After exposure for four weeks to
  increasing doses of pesticide in the diet, the median lethal concentration
  (LC50) was determined to be 3,700 [mu]g/g food. Clinical signs indicated a no
  -observed-effect concentration of 100 [mu]g/g and a lowest-observed-effect
  concentration of 250 [mu]g/g. The growth parameters were decreased with
  increasing exposure to the pesticide. The median effective concentration
  (EC50), which was evaluated based on both shell diameter and dry weight
  inhibitions, was 665 and 424 [mu]g/g, respectively, and the EC10 was 180 and
  145 [mu]g/g, respectively. Accumulation in the viscera was related to the
  amount of dimethoate in the food. The bioconcentration factors were low
  (>6[x]10-3). Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was strongly decreased (80%
  from 250 [mu]g/g). In conclusion, we demonstrated that the species H. aspersa
  could be a useful sentinel organism for organophosphorus contamination surveys.
  Among the effects measured, the inhibition of AChE activities and clinical
  signs were the most sensitive, followed by the growth parameters. These results
  confirm the suitability of the garden snail for development of sublethal
  toxicity tests using primary consumers and aboveground organisms.

AB: Sentinel species are biological monitors that accumulate a pollutant in
  their tissues without significant adverse effects. Primarily used to measure
  the amount of a pollutant that is biologically available, they may also
  increase the sensitivity of an analytical procedure or summarise a complex
  pollution signal. This paper examines the validation of sentinels, referring
  particularly to the use of invertebrates in monitoring toxic metal pollution in
  terrestrial ecosystems. Few studies measure the capacity of a sentinel to
  quantify changes in ambient levels. Definitions of 'bioavailability' also
  differ between workers and few note that this may be a highly species-specific
  measure. Validation requires that the temporal and spatial scales over which a
  sentinel integrates a pollution signal are known. The sentinel has to be
  calibrated against source concentrations and this relationship shown to be
  consistent over the normal range of exposure. This requires some consideration
  of the environmental and biological determinants of pollutant assimilation.
  Differences between populations can confound simple comparisons between sites
  based on native populations. Transplanted individuals, matched for age, sex and
  physiological state, might be used when the aim is not to assess
  bioavailability to the resident population. A simple measure of their capacity
  to detect differences in ambient pollutant levels is proposed to evaluate
  candidate species, to assess their consistency and capacity to equilibrate with
  their source. A small survey of earthworms from a well-defined gradient of Pb
  pollution is used to illustrate problems of interpreting tissue concentrations
  in sentinels.

AB: Sentinels are group members that watch from prominent positions. Sentinel
  interchanges often appear orderly and the number of sentinels changes little
  despite the turnover of individuals. I modeled why solitary individuals or
  group members might take up prominent positions. Such positions can be safe
  places to rest because they provide a good view of approaching predators, even
  if undetected predators preferentially attack sentinels. In pairs, coordinated
  sentinel behavior is favored whenever information spreads from a detecting to a
  non-detecting individual more than half the time. Under these conditions,
  safety for a sentinel produces safety for a forager as a by-product. Thus
  sentinel behavior occurs for selfish safety reasons but coordination of
  sentinels is based on mutualism. If sentinels can coordinate their individual
  actions, evidence of the game is hidden from view. The fitness consequences of
  some games may be best indicated by the strategies organisms take to avoid
  playing them.

AB: Year-round no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) can enhance conservation of
  exploited species and biodiversity overall. MPAs have the potential to sustain
  living marine resources and their support systems at genetic, population
  -community, ecosystem, and landscape levels. From a fisheries perspective they
  can protect spawning and nursery areas of key species, maintain age structure
  (retain older, proportionately more fecund individuals), protect key habitats,
  and reduce bycatch. MPAs are used sporadically in management of fisheries and
  are generally based on predicted responses for populations of exploited taxa.
  However, identification of representative, rare, and high diversity areas of
  temperate and boreal marine systems, especially on outer continental shelves,
  is still in its infancy. There is information available from both the
  scientific literature and from fishers on the life history and behavior of
  economically important species, on species assemblage patterns, and on physical
  structure of the marine environment. Such information could be used as a
  starting point for identifying areas of particular importance to populations or
  communities of fishes and for the conservation of diversity at the regional
  scale. Identification of such areas could serve as a basis to design an
  experimental network of MPAs. Such MPAs, designated for the purpose of
  maintaining or developing sustainable fisheries, must explicitly be designed
  within an experimental context, maintaining flexibility for changes in
  regulations as new information becomes available. Monitoring change in
  exploited and non-target populations (intra- and inter-guild), habitat
  complexity indices, and diversity of sentinel taxa (for assessing maintenance
  of diversity) will be needed to provide feedback to assess the efficacy of MPAs
  and to recommend changes in the regulatory framework.

AB: As sensitive and ecologically relevant measures of environmental conditions,
  bioindicators can be used to assess the health of aquatic ecosystems which may
  be compromised by a variety of environmental stressors such as contaminants,
  sediments, nutrients, and varying temperature, salinity, and hydrologic
  regimes. The bioindicators approach is a proven bioassessment method that uses
  responses of key (sentinel) aquatic organisms both as integrators of stress
  effects and as sensitive response (early-warning) indicators of environmental
  health. This integrated approach involves measuring a suite of selected
  biological and ecological responses at several levels of biological
  organization from the biomolecular and biochemical to the community levels.
  When properly designed and applied in field situations, bioindicator studies
  can help identify causal mechanisms between environmental stressors and
  population and community-level effects, and serve as a basis for which the
  effectiveness of remedial actions on the health of aquatic organisms can be
  evaluated. Rapidly-responding sensitive biomarkers, such as biomolecular and
  biochemical responses, and slower-response ecologically relevant bioindicators,
  such as population and community responses, can be included in field
  bioassessment programs to provide measurement endpoints for use in
  environmental compliance, regulatory decision-making, and ecological risk
  assessments. This bioindicators approach should be particularly relevant in
  helping to identify and diagnose sources of stressors in environments impacted
  by multiple stressors. To demonstrate use of bioindicators in addressing water
  quality issues, spatial and temporal patters in various biological responses
  are related to spatial and temporal patterns of contaminants in two aquatic
  systems compromised by different stressors.
