AB: Under controlled conditions we exposed eggs of 17 potential host taxa
  representing five orders and 14 families to females of Trichogramma platneri
  Nagarkatti, an egg parasitoid used as an inundative biological control agent
  against codling moth, Cydia pomonella L. (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae).
  Trichogramma platneri successfully parasitized species from five lepidopteran
  families (Gelechiidae, Noctuidae, Pyralidae, Sphingidae, Tortricidae) and the
  green lacewing, Chrysoperla carnea Stephens (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae). Female
  wasps spent more time on heavier host eggs and the probability of successful
  parasitism was related to the structural integrity of the chorion of the host
  egg. We observed oviposition attempts on all other lepidopteran hosts offered
  and on eggs of Geocoris punctipes Say (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae) and Nezara
  viridula L. (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae). Dipteran and coleopteran eggs were not
  attacked. Sentinel eggs of the six physiologically acceptable hosts were
  exposed in a walnut orchard in California during inundative releases of T.
  platneri and all hosts were attacked equally. Parasitoids were also equally
  active at all heights from 1.5 to 6.5 m within the orchard canopy. Inundative
  releases of T. platneri may impact naturally occurring populations of green
  lacewings within walnut orchards, and have the potential to impact nontarget
  lepidopteran populations within the release area.

AB: Elimination of an enzootic infection of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) from a
  large population of genetically engineered mice was accomplished by selecting
  seropositive, non-infective breeders for a newly restored MHV-free breeding
  colony. An ELISA was used to test for the presence of MHV-specific antibody,
  and TaqMan reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis
  was used to detect MHV in the feces. After 10 weeks of intentional exposure,
  approximately 30% of mice with MHV antibodies continued to shed MHV in the
  feces. A natural transmission study was conducted to validate that positive
  fecal RT-PCR results indicated presence of infective virus. Sentinel results
  from the re-instituted breeding colony indicated that MHV was successfully
  eliminated by use of RT-PCR analysis for selection of non-infective mice.

AB: Fluorescent dust marking and sentinel pupal bags were used in 1998 and 1999
  to examine dispersal, spatial distribution, and duration of activity of mass
  -released Spalangia cameroni Perkins in a swine facility. In 1998, four
  releases were conducted in the period May-November and in 1999 a final release
  was completed in August. Males were observed in large numbers on window sites
  shortly after releases, whereas females seemed to remain in the environment.
  However, in one trial, and probably due to high air temperatures in the
  facility, a similar flight propensity toward the window sites was noted for the
  females. The distribution of parasitoids was clearly aggregated within a
  perimeter of 3 m from the release point. The duration of activity of marked S.
  cameroni, measured as the number of attacked sentinel pupal bags and
  parasitism, declined to a low level within 2 wk from the time of release. The
  results are discussed in relation to release strategies of S. cameroni in
  control of nuisance flies.

AB: The interaction between soil types, temperature, and soil water potential
  may have differential effects on the survival of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts
  in the terrestrial environment. We examined the effects of three soil types (a
  silty clay loam, silt loam, and loamy sand), three temperatures (4, 20, and 30
  degrees C), and three soil water potentials (-0.033, -0.5 and -1.5 MPa) on the
  inactivation kinetics of oocysts. Sentinel chambers were filled with air-dried
  and sieved soil, brought to the appropriate soil water potential, and
  inoculated with 2 x 10(6) freshly purified oocysts. The inoculated chambers
  were buried in the same bulk soil at the appropriate water potentials and
  incubated at one of the three temperatures. Triplicate chambers were removed
  from the bulk soil on days 0, 22, 43, 84 and 156. Sentinel oocysts were
  extracted, and assayed for potential infectivity by the dye permeability
  method. Oocysts suspended in sterile distilled water and incubated with the
  sentinel chambers were used as controls for the effect of temperature. The soil
  water potentials investigated did not affect oocyst inactivation at any
  temperature or with any of the three soil types. Rates of oocyst inactivation
  increased significantly between 4 and 20 degrees C, but not between 20 and 30
  degrees C with the exception of oocysts incubated in the silty clay loam.
  Oocyst survival appeared to be significantly greater in the silt loam soil than
  in the two other soil types when incubated at 20 degrees C; and at 30 degrees C
  oocyst survival was significantly less in the silt clay loam than in the other
  two soil types. Rates of sentinel oocyst inactivation at all three soil water
  potentials.
 were significantly lower than the control oocysts in water at the
  three test temperatures. Thus oocyst survival in soil was not affected by the
  water potentials between -0.033 and -1.5 MPa; it was affected by soil texture;
  but temperature appeared to be the factor most affecting oocyst survival. In
  the critical ambient range of temperature in temperate climates oocysts may
  survive for months in agricultural soil, and pose a threat to surface waters.

AB: The effects of air quality with three levels of ozone (O3) were studied on
  three cabbage varieties during a one month exposure period in the Valencia area
  by means of modulated chlorophyll (Chl) a fluorescence, lipid peroxidation and
  solute leakage. Increasing O3 exposure reduced the maximum quantum yield of
  PSII photochemistry (F(v)/F(m)) in line with a reduction in non-cyclic electron
  flow (phi(psii)), lower capacity to reduce the quinone pool (q(p)) and a
  decrease in the potential phothosynthetic quantum conversion, Rfd ratio. These
  reductions were more evident in Caramba and Sentinel varieties but lower in
  Othelo. Ozone and its oxidative derivates weakened the plasmalemma, which
  caused a leakage of cellular liquids into intercellular spaces. In our results,
  the ion leakage increased with O3 concentration. Moreover, data from
  thiobarbituric acid reactive (TBARS) analysis confirmed the hypothesis that O3
  modified the membrane structure by increasing the lipid peroxidation more in
  Caramba and Sentinel varieties. These alterations in the membranes reduced the
  ability to develop non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). The O3 effects on solute
  leakage and lipid peroxidation in the Othelo variety were lower than in the
  other two varieties, which allowed non-photochemical quenching to develop in
  this variety. These results suggest the possibility adverse effects of ozone on
  winter crops grown in the Valencia region.

AB: Suction traps (30 cm diameter) were more effective for non-attractant
  sampling of flying adult Culex tarsalis Coquillett than were smaller CDC (5.5
  cm diameter), Malaise or ramp traps. Comparative catch in suction traps
  operated in a variety of vegetation types indicated that females congregated
  along elevated ecotones and were significantly less abundant flying over low
  vegetation or under and over elevated vegetation. Most females taken at upland
  orchards or Tamarisk tree lines were unfed (97%, n = 5,278) and similar in
  reproductive condition to host-seeking females. Blood fed and gravid females
  and males were only abundant near emergence sites. Pyrocide 7396 (Pyrethrin 5%,
  PBO 25%) was applied at the label rate of 5 oz/min by truck mounted Pro-Mist
  ultra low volume (ULV) equipment and particle drift measured by bioassay. ULV
  particles dispersed well downwind over low vegetation, between citrus orchard
  rows, and under date orchard canopy, but did not penetrate citrus orchards or
  vineyards when rows were perpendicular to wind direction. Particles did move up
  and over vegetation contacting sentinel mosquitoes placed above the canopy. The
  congregation of adult mosquitoes at vegetative ecotones and within orchard
  vegetation may afford protection from ground applied ULV particles, negatively
  impacting control. These data may explain why repeated applications often fail
  to interrupt encephalitis virus transmission.

AB: The introduction of a St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLE) genotype new to
  southeastern California during 2000 was followed by focal enzootic
  amplification in the Coachella Valley that was detected by seroconversions of
  29 sentinel chickens in five of nine flocks of 10 chickens each, isolations of
  virus from 30 of 538 pools of 50 Culex tarsalis Coquillett females, and
  collection of 30 positive sera from 2,205 wild birds. This SLE strain over
  wintered successfully and then amplified during the summer of 2001, with 47
  sentinel seroconversions in eight of nine flocks, 70 virus isolations from 719
  pools of Cx. tarsalis and Cx. p. quinquefasciatus Say, and 40 positive sera
  from 847 wild birds. Human illness was not detected by passive case
  surveillance, despite issuance of a health alert during 2001. Virus
  amplification during both years was associated with above average temperatures
  conducive for extrinsic incubation and below average precipitation during
  spring associated with below average vector abundance. Seroconversions by
  sentinel chickens provided the timely detection of virus activity, with initial
  conversions detected before positive mosquito pools or wild bird infections.
  Vertical infection was not detected among Cx. tarsalis adults reared from
  immatures collected during the fall-winter of 2000, even though SLE over
  wintered successfully in this area. Early seroconversions by a sentinel chicken
  during February 2001 and a recaptured Gambel's quail in April 2001 provided
  evidence for transmission during winter and spring when ambient temperatures
  averaged below 17 degrees C, the threshold for SLE replication.

AB: New techniques are presented on the use of 15N to mark insects. 15N, a
  stable isotope of nitrogen, was enriched above natural abundance in plant and
  insect tissues. Two laboratory studies demonstrated that enriched 15N
  -concentrations could be tracked from plant to insect using mass spectrometry.
  In the first study, adult Cotesia plutellae (Kurdjimov) (Hymenoptera:
  Braconidae) and Hippodamia convergens Guerin-Meneville (Coleoptera:
  Coccinellidae) were allowed to feed at the flowers of rapid-cycling Chinese
  cabbage plants that had been fertilized with 15N-enriched potassium nitrate
  (KNO3-15NO3). Both insect groups were found to have significantly elevated 15N
  levels after visiting the flowers of the 15N-enriched plants for 48 hours. In
  the second study, 15N-enriched bean plant (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) tissue was
  incorporated into an insect diet and fed to navel orangeworms, Amyelois
  transitella (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). When the navel orangeworm larvae
  were 4th instars, they were removed from the diet and exposed to the
  parasitoid, Goniozus legneri Gordh (Hymenoptera: Bethylidae). Results indicated
  that the enriched 15N-concentration of the bean plants was transferred to the
  navel orangeworms and, subsequently, to the parasitoids. This work may provide
  useful techniques to help establish whether agriculturally important
  entomophaga visiting 15N-enriched flowers or parasitizing enriched sentinel
  larvae in the field can be effectively marked with 15N.

AB: The egg parasitoid Trichogramma brassicae Bezdenko was introduced from
  Moldavia to western Europe some 30 years ago and since then has been
  inundatively released to control the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis
  Hubner, in maize. We investigated parasitism of non-target butterfly eggs by T.
  brassicae in field cages and under field conditions in Switzerland. Parasitism
  of eggs (exposed for 24 h) of six non-target species (Papilio machaon L.,
  Clossiana selene Denis and Schiffermuller, Maniola jurtina L., Melanargia
  galathea L., Hipparchia alcyone Denis and Schiffermuller, Cyaniris semiargus
  Rottemburg) in field cages of 2x2x2 m ranged between 2.5 and 18.7% when based
  on a relative high number of released parasitoid females (780 +/- 273 SD/cage).
  This number is 16-fold more compared to agricultural practices (120,000/ha). As
  a control, Ephestia kuehniella Zeller eggs were glued on the same plant. A
  difference in parasitism rates between the non-target species and E. kuehniella
  was only observed for M. galathea. During inundative releases of T. brassicae
  in maize, sentinel eggs of two suitable non-target hosts and of E. kuehniella
  were exposed for 72 h. Parasitism rates of E. kuehniella egg masses inside
  maize fields averaged 40% compared to significantly lower parasitism rates of
  26.2 and 12.6% for eggs of H. alcyone and M. galathea. At 2 m distance from the
  maize field, parasitism rates decreased to 2.3% for M. galathea, 6.1% for H.
  alcyone, and 9.8% for E. kuehniella while no single egg was found parasitized
  at 20 m distance from the release fields. We conclude that, although the tested
  non-target butterflies were all attacked under semi-field and field conditions,
  effects on non-target butterflies due to mass released T. brassicae are minimal.

AB: Routine testing of bedding sentinels from a barrier room revealed one mouse
  seropositive to ectromelia virus (EV). Results of hemagglutination-inhibition
  testing and western blot analysis were confirmatory for orthopoxvirus
  antibodies. Additional seropositive animals were not identified. Interviews
  indicated that replication-competent vaccinia virus (VV), Western Reserve
  strain (VV-WR), recently had been given to mice. Although VV-WR was not
  expected to spread by contact or via fomites, the case evidence suggested
  transmission of vaccinia via soiled bedding. In a follow-up experiment, 15
  index mice were inoculated with 107 plaque-forming units of VV by either
  subcutaneous or intrarectal instillation. A dedicated contact sentinel and a
  bedding sentinel were provided for each index mouse. All 15 index mice were
  positive for antibodies when tested 22 days after inoculation. One mouse,
  inoculated by the subcutaneous route, appeared ill and developed lesions on the
  proximal portion of the tail. The contact sentinel mouse housed with this index
  mouse was the only sentinel to seroconvert. We conclude that VV-WR can spread
  to contact sentinels and potentially to bedding sentinels. The ability of other
  VV strains to be transmitted horizontally and the susceptibility of different
  mouse strains to infection merit further investigation. The use of VV in animal
  facilities must be managed carefully since the available serologic tests do not
  distinguish between VV and EV, an exotic agent of major concern to laboratory
  animal facilities.

AB: The effect of host weed phenology, abundance, and diversity and natural
  enemies on the population dynamics of the southern green stink bug, Nezara
  viridula (L.), in Hawaiian macadamia orchards was investigated. We found that
  the highest kernel damage occurred immediately following abrupt reductions in
  the flowering and fruiting stages of host weeds. Areas with the greatest
  diversity of host weeds showed higher damage, presumably because of higher N.
  viridula population levels. Predation rates on sentinel egg masses were highest
  over the two seasons in areas where the bigheaded ant, Pheidole megacephala
  (F.), comprised a large portion of the ant fauna. In one of the orchards, P.
  megacephala and the longlegged ant, Anoplolepis longipes (Jerdon), occurred in
  a spatial mosaic where the boundaries shifted back and forth over time.
  Sentinel egg masses placed in these two adjacent areas showed predation rates
  were highest in the areas dominated by P. megacephala, and intermediate in the
  interface zone and lowest where only A. longipes were found. The importance of
  weed phenology and natural enemy induced mortality is discussed.

AB: The range of the native butterfly Pieris virginiensis Edwards has decreased
  in New York and Ontario since the 1940s. Loss of habitat and harm from Cotesia
  glomerata (L.), a braconid parasitoid introduced to North America in the late
  nineteenth century for biological control of the invasive pest butterfly Pieris
  rapae (L.), have been suggested as the causes of this decline. In western
  Massachusetts, extensive habitat suitable for P. virginiensis remains and its
  principal host plant, Cardamine diphylla, is common. We found P. virginiensis
  to be widely present, occurring at 39% of host plant patches. In laboratory
  tests, we found that both C. glomerata and Cotesia rubecula (Marshall) are able
  to parasitize and successfully develop in P. virginiensis larvae when these are
  presented on detached leaves of C. diphylla. However, when we exposed
  laboratory-reared first or second instars of either P. rapae or P. napi (both
  suitable hosts for these Cotesia spp.) as sentinel larvae on leaves of either
  Brassica oleracea or C. diphylla at sites where P. virginiensis was present, no
  parasitism by either Cotesia sp. was detected. Some sentinel larvae were
  parasitized by an unidentified ichneumonid in the genus Hyposoter. We conclude
  that in western Massachusetts, P. virginiensis is widely distributed at low
  densities and that while it is physiologically an acceptable and suitable host
  for both C. glomerata and C. rubecula, larvae of field populations of this
  butterfly are not attacked because these parasitoids do not forage in forested
  habitats, even when they are locally present in adjacent meadows. Consequently,
  we report that this butterfly is not threatened by these parasitoids contrary
  to early suggestions in the literature.

AB: A bin washing apparatus (drencher) was used to treat late-instar codling
  moth, Cydia pomonella Linnaeus-infested wooden fruit bins with the
  entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema carpocapsae. Sentinel late-instar codling
  moth larvae were placed in strips of wood, made from dismantled bins, that were
  subsequently screwed into the corners of real bins before treatment. Pre
  -soaking the bins with water prior to treatment and covering the bins with a
  plastic tarp post-treatment, to maintain a high humidity, significantly
  increased sentinel codling moth mortality. Treatment for 1 min with 50 S.
  carpocapsae infective juveniles mL-1 water resulted in more than 80% mortality
  over 6 h in which the nematodes were continuously pumped through the drencher.
  The temperature of the water in the bin washer was less than or equal to 15
  degrees C and the chlorine in the city water was too low to harm the nematodes.
  The key disadvantage of washing the bins was the labour involved. It may be
  possible to reduce post-treatment holding time and increase codling moth
  mortality by holding the bins at a higher temperature post-treatment, however
  this parameter was not included in the study. The presence of the codling moth
  granulosis virus within the larvae did not influence the nematode-induced
  codling moth mortality over a range of concentrations and two temperatures in
  laboratory trials.

AB: Ideally, a phytosanitary performance standard would be defined as a
  probabilistic tolerance. For treatments such as solid wood pasteurization, this
  could be operationalized by stating with a specific degree of confidence that
  the treatment failure rate for a sentinel pest should be less than a defined
  level (e.g., X% confidence that the wood heat treatment failure rate for pest Y
  does not exceed Z%). This article illustrates a probabilistic approach to
  developing a phytosanitary performance standard, using heat treatment of the
  wood-inhabiting fungus Postia placenta as an example. The uncertainty about the
  proportion of wood blocks in which P. placenta survives after treatment is
  characterized by the Beta distribution, subject to the biological constraint
  that survival should decrease monotonically with increased time and
  temperature. Monte Carlo simulation techniques are then used to generate a
  probabilistic response surface relating proportion survival to treatment time
  and temperature. This modeling approach relaxes the parametric assumptions
  associated with traditional statistical methods for fitting response surfaces
  and is more flexible than conventional methods, resulting in a better fit to
  the observed data.

AB: An outbreak of paralysis among 16- to 20-week-old CFW Swiss Webster sentinel
  mice developed in one of our barrier facilities. Two months after arrival and
  over a period of four weeks, six of 400 mice purchased from an approved vendor,
  developed progressive hind limb paralysis without other clinical signs of
  disease. On the basis of the histopathologic changes and negative serologic
  test results, lymphoblastic lymphoma causing compression of the spinal cord was
  diagnosed. There were two leading features to this outbreak: its unusual
  epidemiologic presentation, and the localization of the lesions principally in
  the lumbar muscles. A presumptive diagnosis of retroviral infection with
  Abelson's murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) was established on the basis of
  histopathologic and immunohistochemical findings. Little is known about
  retroviral status in many commercial colonies, and few users report presence of
  spontaneous lymphomas. This report points out complications derived from
  commercially available animals that carry endogenous retroviruses. It also
  emphasizes the need of diagnosing and reporting clusters of hind limb paralysis
  or lymphomas in mice to assess the prevalence and relevance of retroviral
  infections in commercial colonies.

AB: When Hereford heifers infested with Boophilus annulatus (Say) were treated
  with a single Ivomec SR Bolus, the concentration of ivermectin in the serum of
  the treated cattle reached a maximum of 8.8 +/- 0.9 ppb at 2 wk posttreatment.
  The single bolus treatment resulted in 84.4% control of standard engorging B.
  annulatus females on treated cattle over the 20-wk trial. Although fewer
  engorged ticks were collected from the sentinel heifers exposed in the treated
  pasture than those in the control pasture at weeks 4, 10, and 16 posttreatment,
  none of the differences was statistically significant. Each exposure of
  sentinel cattle found free-living ticks in both the treated and control
  pastures, indicating the infestation was not eliminated by the treatment. When
  the trial was repeated using two Ivomec SR Boluses/heifer, the concentration of
  ivermectin in the serum of the treated cattle reached a maximum level of 31.2
  +/- 3.9 ppb at week 13 posttreatment. The use of two boluses/heifer resulted in
  99.6% control of standard engorging B. annulatus females over the 20-wk trial.
  No ticks were found on sentinels placed in the treated pasture after week 9
  posttreatment, an indication that the treatment had eliminated the free-living
  population in the treated pasture. From these studies, we conclude that a
  single Ivomec SR Bolus is incapable of sufficient control of B. annulatus to
  meet the rigid requirements of the Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program in
  South Texas. Although two boluses per animal did eliminate the ticks from
  treated heifers and the pasture they were in, the treatment would not be
  sufficiently efficacious for mature cattle (>400 kg) for it to be useful in the
  program.

AB: Three infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) isolates, CU82792, CU82805, and
  CU82808, were recovered from sentinel chickens placed with three different
  layer flocks of a large commercial poultry farm in New York State. The three
  isolates were classified as members of the DE072 serotype on the basis of 1)
  their S1 genes could be amplified with only a modified primer designed for the
  DE072 serotype and 2) their restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns,
  after digestion with endonucleases HaeIII, BstyI and XcmI, were
  indistinguishable from that of DE072 virus. Additional characterization of one
  of the isolates, CU82805, revealed that its S1 gene bears approximately 96%
  identity at the nucleotide level and 94% identity at the amino acid level with
  DE072. Yet, in an in vitro reciprocal virus neutralization test, only a one-way
  neutralization was observed, i.e., antiserum to CU82805 neutralized DE072,
  whereas CU82805 was not neutralized by DE072 antiserum. Implications of these
  findings with regard to IBV diagnosis and immunization are discussed.

AB: Based on the premise that augmented host numbers may help multiply and
  support parasitoid populations, the egg parasitoid Trichogramma platneri
  Nargarkatti was released in apple orchards which were participating in a
  sterile codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.), release program. Nonviable eggs
  resulting from matings involving at least one sterile codling moth partner can
  be successfully parasitized by T. platneri. Grain moth-reared, as well as
  codling moth-reared, T. platneri were released either in the spring or in the
  spring and summer oviposition period(s) of wild codling moth. Sentinel codling
  moth eggs were hung weekly, for 3-day periods, from May until September to
  determine fluctuations in T. platneri populations both during and between
  releases. Low numbers of wild or nonviable coaling moth eggs or other
  susceptible host eggs resulted in sufficient eggs to maintain low spring- or
  summer-introduced T. platneri populations. T. platneri reduced codling moth
  damage in trees in which the Trichogramma were released.

AB: Several species of anuran amphibians have undergone drastic population
  declines in the western United States over the last 10 to 15 years. In
  California, the most severe declines are in the Sierra Mountains east of the
  Central Valley and downwind of the intensely agricultural San Joaquin Valley.
  In contrast, coastal and more northern populations across from the less
  agrarian Sacramento Valley are stable or declining less precipitously. In this
  article, we provide evidence that pesticides are instrumental in declines of
  these species. Using Hyla regilla as a sentinel species, we found that
  cholinesterase (ChE) activity in tadpoles was depressed in mountainous areas
  east of the Central Valley compared with sites along the coast or north of the
  Valley. Cholinesterase was also lower in areas where ranid population status
  was poor or moderate compared with areas with good ranid status. Up to 50% of
  the sampled population in areas with reduced ChE had detectable
  organophosphorus residues, with concentrations as high as 190 ppb wet weight.
  In addition, up to 86% of some populations had measurable endosulfan
  concentrations and 40% had detectable 4,4-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene, 4,4
  -DDT, and 2,4-DDT residues.

AB: Survival has been determined for Pasteurella pneumotropica on various
  surfaces found in an animal room at 23+/-1 degrees C and 50+/-10% relative
  humidity. Longest survival (120 min) was found on mouse hair, shortest (< 30
  min) on laboratory coat fabric. Transmission experiments were performed using
  sentinel animals in order to evaluate the efficiency of their use for the
  detection of P. pneumotropica in quarantined mice. In sentinels exposed to
  infected mice by close contact, P. pneumotropica was detected by culture 2
  weeks post-exposure and seroconversion 3 weeks after contact. Transfer of
  soiled bedding from Pasteurella-infected mice did not infect sentinels within a
  period of 12 weeks as tested by cultivation or serum antibodies.

AB: Variation in susceptibility to viral infection is well documented across
  mouse strains. Specific combinations of viral strains and murine hosts may
  favor viral infection and disease, and could potentially allow the unexpected
  development of chronic, persistent, or latent infections. In some genetically
  modified strains of mice, immune function and perhaps other physiologic or
  metabolic systems may be substantially or marginally impaired. In the case
  study reported here, we document the apparent persistent transmission of mouse
  hepatitis virus (MHV) over a two-year period by MHV-seropositive transgenic
  mice. Transmission occurred via direct contact with seropositive mice and
  exposure to contaminated bedding. However, MHV was not detected at diagnostic
  laboratories by use of viral isolation or reverse transcriptase-polymerase
  chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of tissues from MHV-seropositive animals. Our
  observation, together with the constantly expanding varieties of immune
  -impaired or poorly characterized murine hosts and the burgeoning dissemination
  of these animals throughout the biomedical research community, indicate that
  unexpected pathophysiologic presentations of common murine viral diseases may
  present new challenges to the biomedical research community in the future.

AB: Gastric dilatation (GD) has been observed in Tac:(SW)fBR surveillance mice,
  with mean age of 10 months, that are exposed to high levels of environmental
  antigens during routine exposure to dirty bedding. The aim of the study
  reported here was to determine whether GD was associated with other systemic
  conditions affecting mice. Three groups of nine animals including-surveillance
  mice not exposed to dirty bedding (control), surveillance mice without GD
  (NGD), and surveillance mice with GD (group GD)--had mean stomach weight with
  ingesta of 0.5 +/- 0.02 g, 1.09 +/- 0.07 g (P < 0.0001), and 2.54 +/- 0.4 g (P
  < 0.0001), respectively. Mean serum creatinine concentration was significantly
  higher in GD (1.6 +/- 0.25 mg/dl), compared with NGD (0.17 +/- 0.22 mg/dl, P <
  0.0001) and control (0.2 +/- 0.16 mg/dl, P < 0.0001) mice. In addition, lesions
  consistent with severe chronic nephropathy and mild gastritis were common in
  GD, compared with NGD and control mice. Finally, serum amidated gastrin
  concentration was significantly high in GD (179.37 +/- 53.86 pM, P < 0.03) and
  NGD (264.89 +/- 115.89 pM, P < 0.009), compared with control (60.77 +/- 8.39
  pM) mice. Gastric dilatation syndrome is associated with chronic nephropathy,
  hypergastrinemia, and gastritis in surveillance mice exposed to high levels of
  environmental antigens.

AB: The dispersal behavior of Trichogramma ostriniae Pang et Chen, a potential
  biological control agent of European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis Hubner, was
  investigated in fields of sweet corn in central New York. The aims of the study
  were to quantify T. ostriniae dispersal, to determine whether they persisted in
  release fields, and what minimum number of release points per unit area would
  be adequate to ensure uniform distribution of the wasps for augmentative
  releases. Dispersal was monitored from central release points over distances
  from 35 to 230 m, in a square 9 ha grid of monitoring points, using yellow
  sticky cards and O. nubilalis sentinel egg masses to detect T. ostriniae.
  Results showed that the wasps dispersed rapidly, up to 180 m in 6 days and 230
  m in 21 days. The number of T. ostriniae captured on sticky cards and sentinel
  egg mass parasitism decreased with distance from point of release, although 11
  -40% parasitism of egg masses occurred in monitoring positions most distant
  from the release points. Uniform parasitism of sentinel egg masses was achieved
  in areas of 1-2 ha surrounding central release points. It is suggested that a
  single release point per hectare should be adequate to ensure uniform dispersal
  of T. ostriniae into sweet corn fields.

AB: Infant rats are susceptible to persistent rat virus (RV) infection, but risk
  of persistent infection after prenatal exposure to virus is unclear. We
  examined this aspect of RV infection in the progeny of dams inoculated with
  virus during or prior to pregnancy. Sprague-Dawley (SD) dams were infected
  during pregnancy (gestation day 9) by oronasal inoculation with 10(5) TCID50 of
  the UMass strain of RV.SD rats were infected prior to pregnancy by oronasal
  inoculation of two-day-old females with 10(2) TCID50 of RV-UMass, which induced
  persistent infection. They were mated to non-immune males after reaching sexual
  maturity. Rats were assessed for RV infection by virus isolation, in situ
  hybridization, contact transmission, or serologic testing. The progeny of dams
  inoculated with virus during gestation had high prevalence of infection through
  postpartum week 9 (9 of 12 rats were virus positive at week 3, and 7 of 10 were
  virus positive at week 9). Additionally, 2 of 10 rats were virus positive at
  least through postpartum week 15. The progeny from persistently infected,
  seropositive dams had no evidence of infection and did not transmit infection
  to contact sentinels. However, 12 dams were virus positive at necropsy and 9
  had transmitted infection to their breeding partners. These results indicate
  that prenatal infection in non-immune dams can lead to RV persistence in their
  progeny. By contrast, the progeny of persistently infected dams are protected
  from infection, presumably by maternal antibody, although their dams can
  transmit infection to their breeding partners.

AB: Specific-pathogen-free sentinel birds were used as an initial biological
  system to isolate infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) field isolates from
  commercial broiler farms exhibiting recurrent respiratory problems and poor
  performance. Reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was
  used to amplify a 248-bp product encompassing the hypervariable region of the
  IBDV VP2 gene. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the
  RT-PCR products was performed with the restriction endonucleases DraI, SacI,
  TaqI, StyI, BstNI, and SspI. Two isolates (619 and 850) exhibited a RFLP
  pattern characteristic of Delaware variant E IBDV. Restriction enzyme digestion
  for four isolates (625, 849, 853, and 11153) revealed unmatched RFLP patterns
  when compared with reference IBDV strains. Nucleotide and deduced amino acid
  sequence analyses of the VP2 hypervariable region for these six isolates
  revealed identity (96.3% up to 98%) with Delaware E variant IBDV strain.
  However, serine at position 254, which is characteristic of Delaware variant
  strains, was substituted by asparagine in these six isolates. The seventh IBDV
  isolate (9109) also exhibited a unique RFLP pattern, which included the SspI
  restriction site, which is characteristic of very virulent (vv) IBDV strains.
  Nucleotide and amino acid sequence analyses of the hypervariable region for
  this isolate revealed identity (90%) with the standard challenge strain.
  However, the leucine residue at position 294 was substituted by isoleucine.
  This substitution corresponds to one of the amino acids that are conserved in
  the vvIBDV strains. Antigenic index studies of the predicted amino acid
  sequence of the.
 hypervariable region of VP2 from isolates 619, 625, 849,
  850, 853, and 11153 exhibited a profile almost identical to variant E, whereas
  the isolate 9109 exhibited a profile characteristic of standard IBDV strains.

AB: Commercially obtained Nasonia vitripennis Walker and Muscidifurax
  raptorellus Kogan & Legner were released weekly for 12 wk into a high-rise,
  caged-layer poultry house. After the release period, parasitoids were sampled
  using sentinel house fly (Musca domestica L.) pupae that were either laboratory
  -reared or field-collected as larvae and exposed for 2, 4, 7, and 14 d.
  Parasitoid-induced mortality was observed in 31% of laboratory colony pupae and
  in 26% of field-collected pupae, whereas successful parasitism rates of 48 and
  51% were observed from these pupal sources, respectively. Parasitism was
  primarily by M. raptorellus (88%), and Muscidifurax raptor Girault & Sanders
  (11%), while N. vitripennis accounted for <1%. Percent female progeny ranged
  from 43% in M. raptorellus to 76% in N. vitripennis. Parasitoid emergence from
  2-d exposed sentinel pupae was the lowest of all treatments. Parasitoid
  emergence from 7-d exposed sentinel pupae was the highest of all treatments. We
  found no differences between pupal source, suggesting that when sampling for M.
  raptor, M. raptorellus, and N. vitripennis, in poultry facilities, pupal source
  is not a confounding factor.

AB: Whereas the reproduction ratio (R) of pseudorabies virus (PRV) in vaccinated
  specific pathogen free (SPF) pigs without maternally derived antibodies under
  experimental conditions has repeatedly been shown to be significantly below 1,
  R in vaccinated conventional pigs in the field with maternally derived
  antibodies was significantly above 1. To exclude the difference in husbandry
  conditions as a cause for this discrepancy, we quantified and compared the
  transmission of PRV in both groups under identical experimental conditions.
  Whereas none of the SPF sentinel pigs became infected (R = 0, significantly <
  1), all conventional sentinel pigs did become infected (R = 2.5, significantly
  > 1). Moreover, only one SPF pigs shed virus in saliva, the mean cumulative
  titre being almost a 100-fold less than in conventional pigs (17 pigs, P =
  0.003). In addition, the mean proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes in
  response to PRV antigens was significantly higher in SPF pigs than in
  conventional pigs at all points studied (P < 0.0001). Moreover, the virus
  -neutralising antibody titre after vaccination was significantly higher in SPF
  pigs than in conventional pigs. We conclude that the discrepancy in
  transmission between vaccinated SPF pigs and vaccinated conventional pigs
  cannot be attributed to the experimental conditions.

AB: Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus first appeared in Australia in 1995, when
  three clinical cases (two fatal) were diagnosed in residents on Badu Island in
  the Torres Strait, northern Queensland. More recently, two confirmed human JE
  cases were reported in the Torres Strait Islands and Cape York Peninsula, in
  northern Queensland in 1998. Shortly after JE virus activity was detected in
  humans and sentinel pigs on Badu Island in 1998, adult mosquitoes were
  collected using CO2 and octenol-baited CDC light traps; 43 isolates of JE virus
  were recovered. Although Culex sitiens group mosquitoes yielded the majority of
  JE isolates (42), one isolate was also obtained from Ochlerotatus vigilax
  (Skuse). Four isolates of Ross River virus and nine isolates of Sindbis (SIN)
  virus were also recovered from members of the Culex sitiens group collected on
  Badu Island in 1998. In addition, 3,240 mosquitoes were speciated and pooled
  after being anesthetized with triethylamine (TEA). There was no significant
  difference in the minimum infection rate of mosquitoes anesthetized with TEA
  compared with those sorted on refrigerated tables (2.8 and 1.6 per 1,000
  mosquitoes, respectively). Nucleotide analysis of the premembrane region and an
  overlapping region of the fifth nonstructural protein and 3' untranslated
  regions of representative 1998 Badu Island isolates of JE virus revealed they
  were identical to each other. Between 99.1% and 100% identity was observed
  between 1995 and 1998 isolates of JE from Badu Island, as well as isolates of
  JE from mosquitoes collected in Papua New Guinea (PNG) in 1997 and 1998. This
  suggests that the New Guinea mainland is the likely source of incursions.

  JE virus in Australia.

AB: We investigated some entomological factors underlying altitudinal prevalence
  variation in the Venezuelan Amazonia human onchocerciasis focus. Spatial and
  temporal variation in relative abundance, daily biting rate, proportion of
  parous flies, and monthly parous biting rate were studied for the three main
  simuliid vectors (based on their vectorial competence: Simulium oyapockense
  s.l. Floch & Abonnenc approximately equal to S. incrustatum Lutz << S.
  guianense s.l. Wise). Yanomami villages were selected among sentinel
  communities of the ivermectin control program, representing hypo-to
  hyperendemicity conditions of infection. Spatial variation was explored via
  increasing village altitude on two river systems (A: Ocamo-Putaco and B:
  Orinoco-Orinoquito). Temporal variation was studied between 1995 and 1999 by
  sampling the biting population during dry and rainy months. Environmental
  variables included monthly rainfall and maximum river height. Simuliid species
  composition itself varied along the altitudinal and prevalence gradient. S.
  oyapockense s.l. prevailed below 150 m. Above this altitude and up to 240 m, S.
  incrustatum and S. guianense s.l. became more frequently and evenly collected
  along A but not along B, where S. incrustatum remained absent. The daily biting
  rate of S. oyapockense s.l. was higher during the dry season along A, whereas
  the converse took place along B. Daily biting rate of S. incrustatum was lowest
  during early rains. By contrast, the daily biting rate of S. guianense s.l. was
  highest during this period. There was a significant negative cross-correlation
  between proportion of parous of S. oyapockense s.l. and river height (2 and 3
  mo lagged), whereas this variable (1.
 and 2 mo lagged) was positively
  correlated with the proportion of parous flies for S. incrustatum. Monthly
  parous biting rate values suggest that the months contributing most to
  onchocerciasis transmission in the area are likely to be the dry season and the
  transition periods between seasons.

AB: The garden snail (Helix aspersa) is currently used as bioindicator of
  metallic pollution. Our objective was to extend its use to organic chemicals by
  studying the effects and tissue concentrations of the organophosphorus
  pesticide dimethoate following dietary uptake. After exposure for four weeks to
  increasing doses of pesticide in the diet, the median lethal concentration
  (LC50) was determined to be 3,700 microgram/g food. Clinical signs indicated a
  no-observed-effect concentration of 100 microgram/g and a lowest-observed
  -effect concentration of 250 microgram/g. The growth parameters were decreased
  with increasing exposure to the pesticide. The median effective concentration
  (EC50), which was evaluated based on both shell diameter and dry weight
  inhibitions, was 665 and 424 microgram/g, respectively, and the EC10 was 180
  and 145 microgram/g, respectively. Accumulation in the viscera was related to
  the amount of dimethoate in the food. The bioconcentration factors were low (>6
  x 10(-3)). Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was strongly decreased (80%
  from 250 microgram/g). In conclusion, we demonstrated that the species H.
  aspersa could be a useful sentinel organism for organophosphorus contamination
  surveys. Among the effects measured, the inhibition of AChE activities and
  clinical signs were the most sensitive, followed by the growth parameters.
  These results confirm the suitability of the garden snail for development of
  sublethal toxicity tests using primary consumers and aboveground organisms.

AB: Vectorial capacity of Culicoides sonorensis Wirth & Jones for the
  transmission of bluetongue (BLU) virus was examined at a southern California
  dairy from January 1995 to December 1997. Insects were collected one to two
  times per week in five CDC-type suction traps (without light) baited with CO2
  at a constant release rate of 1,000 ml/min. BLU virus was detected in midges
  collected from May through December with an estimated overall infection rate of
  0.08%. The BLU virus infection rate of field-captured midges was not correlated
  with sentinel calf seroconversions to BLU virus. Sentinel calf seroconversions
  were highly seasonal, occurring from August through November with most calves
  seroconverting during September and October. Vector competence of field
  -collected nulliparous flies fed a locally acquired serotype of BLU virus in
  the laboratory was stable among years (17-23%). Vectorial capacity was strongly
  correlated with BLU virus transmission (measured by sentinel calf
  seroconversions) during 1995 and 1996, but not during 1997. Host biting rate
  estimated for traps nearest to the sentinel calves was the index best
  correlated with BLU virus transmission for all study years and was most highly
  correlated with sentinel seroconversions 4 wk later. The utility of vectorial
  capacity and its component variables is discussed for this system.

AB: Parasitoids of dried-fruit insects were surveyed at a culled fig warehouse
  in Fresno, CA. Three parasitoids of pyralid larvae were found: Habrobracon
  hebetor (Say), Venturia canescens (Gravenhorst), and at least one species in
  the genus Goniozus Forster. Two parasitoids of pyralid pupae also were noted:
  Mesostenus gracilis (Cresson) and a new species of Psilochalcis Keifer. The
  latter is a new host association. Several beetle parasitoids were present,
  including Anisopteromalus calandrae (Howard), three species of Cephalonomia
  Westwood, Laelius centratus (Say), and Cerchysiella utilis Noyes. C. utilis, a
  parasitoid of driedfruit beetle, Carpophilus hemipterus (L.), is a new record
  for California. Most activity by parasitoids (detected by yellow flight traps)
  occurred directly above the fig mass. Pyralid parasitoids exhibited two peaks
  of seasonal activity; one in late summer through early fall, shortly after new
  figs were brought into the warehouse, and one in the spring. H. hebetor
  generally attacked older host larvae, whereas V. canescens equally attacked
  older and younger larvae, indicating that these two parasitoids may coexist by
  exploiting different portions of the host population. H. hebetor was active
  throughout the winter, suggesting that winter release of H. hebetor could be
  used to control diapausing pyralid populations in dried fruit and nut storage
  areas.

AB: Mitotic root micronucleus (MCN) frequency in Vicia faba as a bioassay, is
  primarily based on the extent of the sentinel Vicia response in terms of
  cytogenetic damage quantitatively or qualitatively to indicate the presence of
  mutagenic contaminants. This paper describes an investigation designed to
  assess changes in MCN frequencies of Vicia faba from three generation plants
  obtained, respectively from a reference site (RS) and a metal-contaminated
  experimental field (EF) in the bioassay of mutagenic Cd2+ and NaN3. The
  background value, dose-response to Cd2+ and to NaN3 in three generation (F1, F2
  and F3) plants of the EF and the initial (F0) plants were determined in terms
  of MCN frequencies. With more generations of growing Vicia plants in the EF, a
  higher background value of MCN frequency, a lower slope value in the regression
  equation, a smaller ratio of MCN frequency between the control and treatment in
  the same generation and larger perturbation values were observed. This denotes
  that the decreased reliability and efficiency are represented in Vicia plants
  from the EF if the plants are used as sentinels in the bioassay of mutagenic
  Cd2+ and NaN3. It was concluded that the Vicia MCN bioassay should be used as
  an endpoint biomarker acceptable in biomonitoring environmental mutagens when
  the sentinel plants were collected from clean areas. Because no place is
  absolutely without pollutants, it is suggested that several seed stock centers
  should be established for providing sentinel Vicia if Vicia MCN bioassay is
  used as a biomarker to identify the global environmental status.

AB: Tradescantia pallida cv. Purpurea, a popular garden plant in Brazil, was
  used for the Tradescantia micronucleus (Trad-MCN) assay. In situ monitoring of
  the genotoxicity of air pollutants was carried out by sentinel approach, using
  the plant grown in the field or using the plants in pots which were carried to
  the monitoring sites. Two highly polluted sites, in Sao Paulo city (Cerqueira
  Cesar and Congonhas) and two rural sites (the cities of Pirassununga, 200 km
  and Caucaia do Alto, 50 km from Sao Paulo, respectively) were chosen for this
  study, in order to determine the gradient difference of the air pollution
  levels. Sentinel plants in Congonhas site presented the highest frequency of
  micronuclei (4.4%), in comparison with 2.2 and 2.3% found in plants from
  Pirassununga and Cerqueira Cesar sites, respectively (Kruskal-Wallis; P <
  0.020). Significant increases (F test; P < 0.0001) in the frequency of
  micronuclei were observed in plants exposed in the polluted urban sites
  (Cerqueira Cesar: 5.7%; Congonhas: 7.1% and Caucaia do Alto: 2.3%). The
  increase in the frequency of micronuclei observed indicates the potential risk
  of mutagenicity in presence of high concentrations of pollutants.

AB: Background and Purpose: Natural infection of research mice with
  enterohepatic Helicobacter spp. is common and may confound experimental studies
  from intercurrent disease. We evaluated a protocol of dirty bedding exposure
  for transmission of Helicobacter infection from colony mice to female
  Tac:(SW)fBR sentinel mice over 6 months. Methods: Cecal scrapings from culled
  colony mice and associated sentinel mice were tested for H. hepaticus, H.
  rodentium, and H. bilis using polymerase chain reaction analysis (PCR). These
  results were correlated with the results of sentinel serum IgG responses
  measured by ELISA. Results: In 9 colony rooms, 43 of 45 mice were infected with
  H. hepaticus; in 14 rooms, 58 of 70 mice were infected with H. rodentium; and
  in 2 rooms, 2 of 10 mice were infected with H. bilis. Concurrence of
  Helicobacter infection between colony and sentinel mice was 82% for H.
  hepaticus, 88% for H. rodentium, and 94% for H. bilis. Concurrence of
  Helicobacter infection status of sentinel cagemates was 98% for H. hepaticus,
  86% for H. rodentium, and 95% for H. bilis. Fecal samples pooled by sentinel
  cage had positive PCR results for H. hepaticus and H. rodentium at 1 month in
  60 and 44%, respectively, of the cages that contained test-positive mice at
  necropsy (6 months). By 3 months, detection rates were 100 and 81% for H.
  hepaticus and H. rodentium, respectively, and H. bilis was not detected until 4
  months. Newly acquired infections with H. rodentium and H. bilis were evident
  throughout the 6-month study period. Seroconversion was coincident with
  positive PCR results in sentinel mice, and serum IgG values continued to
  increase until necropsy. The serum IgG ELISA was 98 to 100% sensitive, but was
  low.
 in specificity (34 to 44%), most likely attributable to common
  coinfection with H. hepaticus and H. rodentium. Conclusion: Sentinel mice
  acquire infection with Helicobacter spp. through dirty bedding exposure.
  Combined use of PCR analysis and serologic testing of sentinel mice was
  predictive of Helicobacter infection status of mouse colonies used for
  biomedical research.

AB: Over a 2-year period field trials were conducted to assess the potential to
  disrupt mating of Plutella xylostella (L.) using a commercial rope formulation
  of a 70:30 mixture of (Z)-11-hexadecenal and (Z)-11-hexadecenyl acetate, two
  components of the sex pheromone of the female. Screened field cages were placed
  into blocks of cabbage which were either treated with the pheromone or left
  untreated. Different densities of P. xylostella pupae were placed into each
  cage and then larval and pupal counts were made of the subsequent generation.
  In addition, sentinel females at mating stations were placed in each cage to
  assess the influence of the pheromone on the ability of males to locate and
  mate with females. Likewise, we used pheromone traps to assess whether the
  pheromone treatment influenced the ability of males to locate a pheromone
  source. In both years larval and pupal populations, produced as a result of the
  original inoculation, did not differ between pheromone-treated and untreated
  fields. The effect of pheromone treatment on larval and pupal numbers did not
  change with changes in inoculated P. xylostella density, however, the density
  of P. xylostella released caused significant differences in the density of the
  subsequent generation. No significant differences were detected between the
  number of sentinel female adult P. xylostella that successfully mated in
  pheromone-treated fields compared with untreated fields. Significant
  differences in the numbers of male P. xylostella caught in pheromone-baited
  traps occurred between pheromone-treated and untreated fields in the first
  trial of 1993, and in the first trial in 1994 but not in the second trial. Such
  differences are often thought.
 of as indications of mating disruption,
  although our other data presented in this study and reports from other studies
  indicate this is not always the case. Previous studies on mating disruption of
  P. xylostella in larger scale field tests have been performed but the results
  have been variable and often ambiguous. Overall, our results indicate that
  mating disruption of P. xylostella with the present technology does not appear
  to work even under the very controlled situations which we utilized to
  eliminate insect movement between plots.

AB: The influence of gastrointestinal nematode infections on performance of four
  groups of female Holstein Friesian calves was monitored until the end of the
  second grazing season (SGS). In the first year three groups were grazed and one
  group (G4) was permanently housed. General and grazing management during the
  first grazing season (FGS) was arranged such that G1 acquired moderate
  infections, G2 low infections and G3 very low infections with gastrointestinal
  nematodes. These infections were monitored through faecal egg counts,
  differentiation of faecal larval cultures, pasture larval counts, serum
  pepsinogen values, ELISA with a recombinant Cooperia oncophora protein, weight
  gain, tracer worm counts and sentinel worm counts. In 1998 all four groups were
  grazed together as one herd from 23 April to 26 October and infections were
  monitored with the same techniques with the exception of sentinel calves. In
  the FGS weight gain was higher in G4 than in the other groups and higher in G3
  (28.6 kg) than in G1. Weight gain of G2 was intermediate to G1 and G3 but did
  not significantly differ from either group. In the SGS weight gain in G4 was
  far less than in any other group and the mean weight at the end of the
  experiment was 41.9, 38.6 and 50.9 kg lower than G3, G1 and G2, respectively.
  Though no significant differences were observed between G1, G2 and G3 at the
  end of the experiment it was obvious that the weight gain advantage of G3 over
  G1 at the end of the FGS had disappeared. Parasitological and serological
  findings in the SGS indicated that G3 and G4 had build up less immunity during
  the FGS compared to G1 and G2. The conclusion of the experiment is that
  resilience to.
 parasitic gastroenteritis in the SGS depends on the level of
  exposure to nematodes in the FGS. However, problems with poor weight gain only
  will be expected when exposure is very low in the FGS and high in the SGS.

AB: Isogenic mutants of Salmonella enteritidis defective for the elaboration of
  fimbrial types SEF14, SEF17, SEF21 and flagella were used to study the
  contribution these organelles made to colonization, invasion and lateral
  transfer in young chicks. The caecum, liver and spleen were colonized within 24
  h following oral inoculation of 1-day-old chicks with 10(5) wild-type S.
  enteritidis strain LA5. However, for some mutants, the numbers of organisms
  recovered from internal organs was reduced significantly, particularly at 24 h
  post-inoculum, which supported the hypothesis that the organelles contribute to
  invasion and dissemination to internal organs. Specifically, mutations
  affecting SEF17, SEF21 and flagella contributed to a delay in colonization of
  the spleen, and those affecting SEF21 and flagella delayed colonization of the
  liver. Lower numbers of bacteria were recovered from the caecum with mutants
  deficient in elaboration of SEF21. Sentinel birds were colonized by LA5 or
  EAV40 (14-, 17-, 21-, fla-) directly from the environment within 2 days,
  although a consistent slight delay was observed with the multiple mutant.
  Overall, our data suggest a collective role for SEF17, SEF21 and flagella, but
  not SEF14, in the early stages of colonization and invasion of young chicks by
  S. enteritidis, but these surface appendages appear unnecessary for
  colonization of birds from their immediate environment.

AB: Six male and six female Yucatan pigs were utilized to investigate the
  feasibility of this species as a non-rodent model for routine regulatory and
  mechanistic toxicology studies. This study evaluated disease surveillance and
  computerized electrophysiology, along with possible gross and micropathology
  changes. Two pigs were used as sentinel animals to evaluate the microbiological
  status of the vendor upon arrival; the other pigs were maintained as
  biomonitors and to provide baseline clinical chemistry, urinalysis, pathology
  and electrophysiology data. The electrophysiology tests conducted included
  electrocardiography (ECG), electroretinography (ERG) and quantitative
  electroencephalography (qEEG), which achieved consistent baseline values with
  acceptable intrasubject variation. Tissue cholinesterase and histochemical
  staining were done to determine their suitability for testing cholinesterase
  compounds. Evaluation of the serum chemistry profile demonstrated increased CPK
  and LDH, which was likely associated with slight haemolysis or minor
  subclinical muscle stress during handling. There were no additional clinical
  chemistry changes or findings in haematology, urinalysis parameters or gross
  pathology. Micropathology found an absence of background lesions which would
  interfere with routine toxicology studies, except for a mild rhinitis. The
  aetiological agent was identified by electron microscopy as being consistent
  with inclusion body rhinitis of swine, previously unreported in miniature
  swine. This would most notably interfere with inhalation studies. The
  anatomical and physiological similarities of the Yucatan pig, along with its
  ability to accept the performance of.
 electrophysiology tests allow this
  species to be considered as a suitable model for organ system testing in
  toxicology studies.

AB: Mummichog, a small-sized sentinel fish species, has been proposed for use in
  environmental effects monitoring programs conducted by pulp mills that release
  their effluent in marine waters. In order to evaluate the suitability of
  mummichog as a sentinel species and to support the interpretation of biological
  effects data, tissue concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and
  dibenzofurans, (PCDD/Fs), chlorophenolic compounds (CPs), polychlorinated
  biphenyls (PCBs), and chlorinated pesticides were investigated in mummichog
  sampled in the Miramichi Estuary, which was receiving a bleached-kraft mill
  (BKM) effluent, and in a reference estuary, the Bouctouche Estuary. Higher
  concentrations PCDD/Fs (up to 50 times), CPs (up to 60 times), DDT, and PCBs
  (up to 10 times) were found in mummichog sampled at the upstream site of the
  Miramichi Estuary. At this site, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin toxic
  equivalent concentrations were slightly above the threshold for ethoxy
  resorufin O-deethylase induction. Multivariate analyses on congener profiles
  revealed that the contamination by PCDD/Fs and CPs originated both from the BKM
  and from a former wood-preservation plant and that PCDD/Fs and CPs typical of
  the BKM were transported 40 km downstream from the mill. Patterns and levels of
  persistent contaminants differed between sites within the Estuary, indicating
  that the fish did not mix during their growing period. These findings support
  the use of mummichog in environmental effects monitoring programs, because this
  species bioaccumulates chlorinated compounds contained in BKM effluent and is
  sedentary. The cause-effect relationship between exposure to the BKM effluent
  and the observed.
 biological responses will have to be demonstrated by
  laboratory studies because of the presence of multiple sources of contamination.

AB: Disease severity caused by races 1 through 6 of Xanthomonas campestris pv.
  vesicatoria on eight near-isogenic lines (isolines) of Early Calwonder (ECW)
  with three major resistance genes (Bs1, Bs2, and Bs3) in different combinations
  was evaluated in the greenhouse and field. Strains representing races 1, 3, 4,
  and 6 caused similar high levels of disease severity, followed by races 2 and 5
  on susceptible ECW. Race 3 caused severe disease on all isolines lacking
  resistance gene Bs2. Race 4, which defeats Bs1 and Bs2, caused less disease on
  isoline ECW-12R (carries Bs1 + Bs2), than on isolines ECW, ECW-10R (carries
  Bs1), and ECW-20R (carries Bs2). Similar results were obtained with race 4
  strains in field studies conducted during 1997 and 1998. In greenhouse studies,
  race 6, which defeats all three major genes, caused less disease on isoline ECW
  -13R (carries Bs1 + Bs3) and ECW-123R (carries Bs1 + Bs2 + Bs3) than on
  isolines ECW, ECW-10R, ECW-20R, and ECW-30R (carries Bs3), but not on ECW-23R
  (carries Bs2 + Bs3). In greenhouse studies with commercial hybrids, strains of
  races 4 and 6 caused less disease on Boynton Bell (carries Bs1 + Bs2) than on
  Camelot (carries no known resistance genes), King Arthur (carries Bs1), and X3R
  Camelot (carries Bs2). Race 6 caused less disease on hybrid R6015 (carries Bs1
  + Bs2 + Bs3) and Sentinel (carries Bs1 + Bs3) than on Camelot. Residual effects
  were not as evident in field studies with race 6 strains. Defeated major
  resistance genes deployed in specific gene combinations (i.e., gene pyramids)
  were associated with less area under the disease progress curve than when genes
  were deployed individually in isolines of ECW or commercial hybrids. Successful
  management of.
 bacterial spot of pepper is achieved incrementally by
  integrating multiple tactics. Although there is evidence of residual effects
  from defeated genes, these effects alone likely will not provide acceptable
  bacterial spot control in commercial production fields. However, when combined
  with sanitation practices and a judicious spray program, pyramids of defeated
  resistance genes may aid in reducing the risk of major losses due to bacterial
  spot.

AB: Leptotrombidium deliense Walch that attached to sentinel laboratory mice and
  the roof rat, Rattus rattus (L.), placed in an orchard habitat near Bangkok,
  Thailand, were studied between April 1993 and April 1995. A single L. deliense
  larva was attached to only 1 of 51 laboratory mice placed in the study area
  between April and September 1993. Overall, 89/202 (44.1%) R. rattus had 1 or
  more L. deliense larvae attached, and Orientia tsutsugamushi (Hayashi), the
  etiologic agent for scrub typhus, was isolated from liver/spleen samples of
  2/202 (1.0%) rats placed in an endemic area for a single night. A total of 474
  L. deliense attached to sentinel R. rattus, of which 314 larvae successfully
  fed to repletion and were recovered, and 2 (0.6%) of these were naturally
  infected with O. tsutsugamushi. The occurrence of L. deliense was influenced by
  rainfall, with more chiggers attached to rodents in the wetter months of the
  year. The study showed that the risk of exposure to infection with O.
  tsutsugamushi is greater during the wetter months of the year, and that only a
  relatively small number of chigger attachments are needed to infect potential
  hosts.

AB: Pteromalid parasitoids were sampled using sentinel bags containing house fly
  puparia as bait and placed in broiler-breeder houses of northwest Arkansas.
  Collected pteromalids were examined for occurrence of microsporidian pathogens.
  Five pteromalid species were collected: Muscidifurax spp. Nasonia vitripennis,
  Pachycrepoideus vindemiae, Spalangia cameroni, and S. endius. Relative wasp
  abundances were 10.3, 16.6, 32.4, 20.3, and 20.2% in 1994 and 30.7, 7.0, 22.7,
  6.0, and 33.5% in 1995 for Muscidifurax spp., N. vitripennis, P. vindemiae, S.
  cameroni, and S. endius, respectively. Infection prevalences were 13.0, 3.0,
  12.0, 21.0, and 31.0% in 1994 and 5.0, 16.0, 50.0, 50.0, and 58.0% in 1995 for
  Muscidifurax spp., N. vitripennis, P. vindemiae, S. cameroni, and S. endius,
  respectively. These results are the first known reports of microsporidia from
  field-collected specimens of N. vitripennis, P. vindemiae, S. cameroni, and S.
  endius. Though commercially reared pteromalids were released in some houses for
  fly control, these "release" wasps were not a major source of microsporidia.
  Spore sizes differed significantly among wasp species but not between the years
  collected. Microsporidioses in field populations of pteromalids might have
  negative impacts on the poultry industry; parasitoids infected with the
  pathogens are less fecund than healthy wasps, potentially leading to reduced
  filth fly control.

AB: The potential of Dicyphus hesperus Knight as a predator of greenhouse
  whitefly, Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood), and two-spotted spider mites,
  Tetranychus urticae Koch, was assessed in the laboratory and in a tomato
  greenhouse. D. hesperus adults fed readily upon both pest species in the
  laboratory, and nymphs completed development from egg to adult on either
  whitefly or mites. Whitefly, however, were a superior food for growth and
  development of D. hesperus compared to mites. Development time was shorter and
  resulting adult body size was larger for nymphs reared on whitefly compared to
  those reared on mites. In a greenhouse release, adults oriented to and
  oviposited on whitefly-infested sentinel plants but did not orient to mite
  -infested sentinel plants. D. hesperus adults oviposited on greenhouse tomatoes
  and their progeny completed development in a greenhouse in which both whitefly
  and mites were present. The results are discussed as they relate to the use of
  D. hesperus for biological control of pests of greenhouse vegetables.

AB: House flies, Musca domestica L., breed rapidly in poultry house manure and
  consequently pose a nuisance and public health threat. We studied the dispersal
  of commercially produced Muscidifurax raptorellus Kogan and Legner, a
  biological control agent of flies, in a high-rise poultry facility in
  Pennsylvania. We released this pupal parasitoid at three densities in the pit
  of a poultry house and recorded emergence of F(1) and F(2) progeny from
  spatially referenced field-collected and laboratory-reared sentinel hosts over
  a 10-week period. Among the F(1) progeny, there were higher rates of successful
  parasitism from laboratory reared hosts, rendering them more suitable
  indicators of dispersal than field-collected conspecifics for the first
  generation. Overall, the emergence of both F(1) and F(2) progeny of M.
  raptorellus decreased exponentially over distance, with the greatest emergence
  occurring within 2 m of release points, suggesting its utility as a site
  -specific control tactic of house flies.

AB: The efficacy of an injectable microsphere formulation of ivermectin for
  control of the cattle tick, Boophilus annulatus (Say), was tested on 2 groups
  of 6 Hereford heifers held on separate 7-ha, tick-infested, buffel grass
  pastures. Cattle in one pasture were injected subcutaneously in the neck with a
  controlled-release microsphere formulation of ivermectin at the rate of 2.4 mg
  AI/kg body weight; the other group was injected with carrier only. Beginning 4
  wk after injection and continuing throughout the remainder of the test (16 wk),
  no engorged ticks (> or = 5.5 mm) were found on any of the treated cattle,
  whereas large numbers of engorged ticks were found on the untreated controls
  during this period, a few ticks were recovered from untreated sentinel animals
  placed in the treatment pasture during 7-8 wk after treatment, but none were
  recovered from animals exposed from 11-12 wk or 14-15 wk. Large numbers of B.
  annulatus ticks were found on untreated sentinel cattle placed in the control
  pasture during these same periods. Although the cattle, pastures, and tick
  habitat were approximately equal, the treated cattle gained an average of 77 kg
  compared with an average of 42 kg for the control group. This technology offers
  a possible alternative to the current official program of dipping and vacating
  pastures for eradication of Boophilus sp. infestations from the quarantine zone
  in southern Texas. Larger scale testing is needed to determine the potential of
  the injectable microsphere formulation and to optimize its use in eradication
  or control strategies.

AB: 'Reduction' and  Refinement' can be achieved in transgenic mouse studies by
  re-deriving transgenic mouse lines and subsequently maintaining them under high
  standards of husbandry in a unit with restricted access. This report describes
  the initial steps of a project to improve the health and welfare of transgenic
  mice at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), by re-deriving
  transgenic lines as microbiologically defined animals to be maintained in a
  barrier unit in a newly constructed animal facility. A pilot study showed that
  it was possible to transfer embryos obtained from contaminated donor mice in
  the old facility to specific pathogen free recipients housed in a ventilated
  cabinet in the new unit, without concomitant carry over of disease. The
  offspring born following embryo transfer were of high health status and did not
  show any evidence of contamination with any of the pathogens present in the
  mice in the old animal unit. Antibodies to various murine viruses (mouse
  hepatitis virus (MHV), rota virus, reo-3 virus, Theilers encephalomyelitis
  virus, adenovirus) and parasites were present in sentinel animals from the old
  animal house whereas the re-derived animals were found to be free of virus
  antibodies and parasites. Therefore the methods used were considered to be
  successful in terms of disease prevention and enhancement of welfare. The
  barrier unit was sterilized without the use of formaldehyde or related
  substances, to minimize the risks to personnel and to the environment from
  using potentially dangerous substances. From the results of in vitro and in
  vivo screening, the protocol for sterilization described here was found to be
  effective in achieving.
 microbiological sterility of the barrier unit and was
  cost effective.

AB: Organotin pollution has been monitored in mollusks from the Catalan coast
  (Spain). Tributyltin (TBT) was the major compound detected, ranging from 200 to
  1,100 ng/g wet weight as Sn. Tributyltin metabolites and triphenyltin (TPhT)
  were also detected although to a lesser extent. Virtually organotin-free
  mollusks were obtained in the Alfacs Bay (Ebro Delta). Aromatase activity was
  determined in the digestive gland of a selected number of samples by measuring
  the tritiated water release from [1beta-(3)H]-androstenedione. Enzyme activity
  was linear as a function of incubation time and protein content of the
  microsomal fraction. It was determined at a substrate concentration of 10
  micromolar, and it exhibited a typical Michaelis-Menten kinetic, with an
  apparent constant, K(m), of 32 +/- 3 micromolar. Low aromatase activity (217
  -264 fmol/h/mg protein) was seen in mussels sampled in TBT-polluted
  environments compared with mussels from the virtually organotin-free point (345
  fmol/h/mg protein). These results support the hypothesis of a TBT-mediated
  inhibition of cytochrome P450-aromatase activity in mussels, although no
  significant changes on tissue titers (if testosterone/estradiol were observed.

AB: Seven field releases of Trichogramma ostriniae and T. nubilale (Hymenoptera:
  Trichogrammatidae) were made separately and in combination in a sweet corn
  field to compare the level of parasitism in sentinel eggs of the European corn
  borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). The results indicate that
  the levels of egg parasitism among different release dates differed mainly
  because of changes in weather and plant architecture within the season. The
  level of egg parasitism by releasing T. ostriniae alone was found to be 15%
  higher than that by releasing T. nubilale alone, and 20% higher than by
  releasing the combination of the two species. Further analyses using the
  logistic regression model for independent and correlated data indicated T.
  ostriniae to be more efficient at discovering host egg masses and to have
  higher levels of egg parasitism than T. nubilale. Mutual interference between
  T. ostriniae and T. nubilale was the main factor for the lower level of egg
  parasitism when T. ostriniae and T. nubilale were released together. The
  results suggest that T. ostriniae is the better candidate for augmentative
  releases for control of the European corn borer, and the two species should not
  be released into a corn field at the same time.

AB: A field trial in Zimbabwe investigated the efficacy of insecticide-treated
  cattle as a barrier to prevent the re-invasion of tsetse, Glossina morsitans
  and G. pallidipes (Diptera: Glossinidae), into cleared areas. The original
  tsetse barrier consisted of insecticide-treated odour-baited targets, at an
  operational density of four to five targets per (km)2, supported by insecticide
  -treatments of cattle with either deltamethrin dip (Decatix, Coopers) at two
  -weekly intervals, or deltamethrin pouron (Spoton, Coopers) at monthly
  intervals, in a band approximately equal to 20 km wide from the reinvasion
  front. Tsetse catch, and trypanosomiasis incidence in nine sentinel herds was
  recorded for 7-8 months, respectively, before the targets were removed, leaving
  only the insecticide treatment of the local cattle to stem the reinvasion of
  tsetse. After the removal of the target barrier, the tsetse readily invaded the
  trial area and the incidence of trypanosomiasis in sentinel herds increased,
  while their PCVs decreased. After seven months without the targets in place,
  trypanosomiasis prevalence in the local stock had reached alarmingly high
  levels; the trial was terminated prematurely and the target barrier re
  -deployed. Immediately after the re-deployment of the target barrier, the
  tsetse catch in the trial area reverted to acceptable levels along the
  reinvasion front, and trypanosomiasis incidence in the sentinel cattle
  decreased. It is concluded that, under the conditions of the field trial, the
  insecticidal treatment of local cattle did not in itself form an effective
  barrier to tsetse reinvasion. By contrast, the target barrier performed as was
  predicted by mathematical.
 and experimental analysis, and readily cleared the
  tsetse infestation and reduced trypanosomosis incidence in the trial area.

AB: A small-volume sentinel chamber was developed to assess the effects of
  environmental stresses on survival of sucrose-Percoll-purified Cryptosporidium
  parvum oocysts in soil and animal wastes. Chambers were tested for their
  ability to equilibrate with external chemical and moisture conditions. Sentinel
  oocysts were then exposed to stresses of the external environment that affected
  their viability (potential infectivity), as indicated by results of a dye
  permeability assay. Preliminary laboratory experiments indicated that
  temperatures between 35 and 50 degrees C and decreases in soil water potential
  (-0.003 to -3.20 MPa) increased oocyst inactivation rates. The effects of two
  common animal waste management practices on oocyst survival were investigated
  on three dairy farms in Delaware County, N.Y., within the New York City
  watershed: (i) piling wastes from dairy youngstock (including neonatal calves)
  and (ii) spreading wastes as a soil amendment on an agricultural field.
  Sentinel containers filled with air-dried and sieved (2-mm mesh) youngstock
  waste or field soil were wetted and inoculated with 2 million oocysts in an
  aqueous suspension and then placed in waste piles on two different farms and in
  soil within a cropped field on one farm. Controls consisted of purified oocysts
  in either phosphate-buffered saline or distilled water contained in sealed
  microcentrifuge tubes. Two microdata loggers recorded the ambient temperature
  at each field site. Sentinel experiments were conducted during the fall and
  winter (1996 to 1997) and winter (1998). Sentinel containers and controls were
  removed at 2- to 4-week intervals, and oocysts were extracted and tested by the
  dye permeability assay. The.
 proportions of potentially infective oocysts
  exposed to the soil and waste pile material decreased more rapidly than their
  counterpart controls exposed to buffer or water, indicating that factors other
  than temperature affected oocyst inactivation in the waste piles and soil. The
  effect of soil freeze-thaw cycles was evident in the large proportion of empty
  sentinel oocysts. The potentially infective sentinel oocysts were reduced to
  <1% while the proportions in controls did not decrease below 50% potentially
  infective during the first field experiment. Microscopic observations of empty
  oocyst fragments indicated that abrasive effects of soil particles were a
  factor in oocyst inactivation. A similar pattern was observed in a second field
  experiment at the same site.

  aphids) on cotton leaves were exposed for 8 h to the air over a commercial
  cotton field in Louisiana during the night of 1-2 July 1995. At 0015 h there
  were 90,437 primary conidia/m3 air of the fungus Neozygites fresenii
  (Entomophthorales: Neozygitaceae) at the midfield position as determined from
  Rotorod samples. Forty-eight percent (n = 106) of the sentinel aphids exposed
  for 8 h at midfield were infected by aerial conidia of N. fresenii. Exposure of
  sentinel aphids outside the cotton field, at 10 and 100 m downwind and 10 m
  upwind, resulted in 34.8% (n = 131), 24.0% (n = 129), and 17.4% (n = 146)
  infected aphids, respectively. These data demonstrate that wind-dispersed
  aerial conidia of N. fresenii are infective and rapidly and efficiently
  disperse the pathogen throughout aphid populations within and between fields.

AB: A widespread epidemic of St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus was reported
  from central Florida from late July through December 1990 with 226 clinical
  cases and 11 deaths in humans. The abundance of blood-fed and gravid Culex
  nigripalpus Theobald females, the vector of SLE in Florida, was monitored at a
  resting site in Indian River County, FL, for the 3 yr before the epidemic, the
  epidemic year, and for 1 yr following the epidemic. Each study year was divided
  into four 3-mo periods that depict the subtropical SLE transmission cycle; a
  January-March maintenance phase, an April-June amplification phase, a July
  -September early transmission phase, and an October-December late transmission
  phase. The abundance of blood-fed and gravid females was significantly greater
  during the amplification, early transmission, and late transmission phases of
  the 1990 SLE epidemic when compared with the 3 pre-epidemic years. Throughout
  the study, Cx. nigripalpus blood feeding and oviposition was driven by epic
  (>50 mm) rainfall events. The abundance of gravid females decreased, whereas
  the number of blood-fed females increased following heavy rainfalls. Epizootic
  and epidemic transmission of SLE to sentinel chickens and humans in Indian
  River County was greatest immediately following heavy rainfalls that
  synchronized Cx. nigripalpus oviposition and blood feeding.

AB: Objective: To describe the design of the Olestra Postmarketing Surveillance
  Study (OPMSS) and to present baseline results from the sentinel site. The
  purpose of the OPMSS is to monitor consumption patterns of olestra-containing
  snacks and to determine whether consumption affects nutritional status. Design:
  The OPMSS combines repeated cross-section, random-digit dial telephone surveys
  before and after the market release of olestra-containing foods as well as
  intensive dietary and clinical assessments on a subsample of survey
  participants. Subjects: Data are from baseline telephone (n=1,962) and clinical
  (n=1,069) assessment of participants (aged 18 to 74 years) in the Marion
  County, Indiana, sentinel site. Mean age of participants in the telephone
  survey was 43.2 years; 19% of respondents were black and 29% had completed
  college. Statistical analysis: Analyses examined associations among savory
  snack use, fruit and vegetable consumption, and demographic and health-related
  characteristics. Data from the telephone survey were adjusted to be
  representative of the Marion County population. Results: Almost 96% of the
  population surveyed had eaten savory snacks in the month before the survey: 74%
  had eaten regular-fat, 26% fat-reduced, and 78% nonfat types. Total snack
  consumption did not differ by gender, education, or race. Residents younger
  than 35 years ate snacks 16 times a month compared with 12 times a month among
  older residents. Types of snacks consumed differed markedly by demographic
  characteristics. Male, younger, and less educated residents ate more regular
  -fat snacks; female, white, and college-educated residents ate more nonfat
  snacks. In general, residents practicing healthful.
 behaviors, including not
  smoking, eating fruits and vegetables, and exercising, also ate fewer regular
  -fat and more nonfat snacks. Fat intake was also related linearly to use of
  snack foods, ranging from 33.2% of energy among those consuming 1 serving per
  month or less to 36.8% among those consuming 20 or more servings per month.
  Applications/conclusions: Procedures for recruitment and nutrition assessment
  appear adequate for evaluating the impact of olestra consumption on nutritional
  status. Nutritionists should be aware that there is potential for relatively
  high olestra consumption, given that almost 35% of Marion County residents eat
  snack foods at least 20 times a month. Consumers eating at least 20 servings of
  snacks per month derived more than 12% of their total energy and fat from snack
  foods, which suggests that substituting olestra snacks could substantially
  reduce intakes of fat and energy.

AB: Egg production drops associated with western equine encephalitis (WEE) virus
  infection occurred in three turkey breeder flocks in California during summer
  1993 and again in one flock the following year. Egg production losses totaled
  8.76%, 9.57%, 9.71%, and 10.12% and were accompanied by an increase in small
  white-shelled and shell-less eggs. The outbreaks coincided with peak WEE virus
  activity in the state on the basis of statistics compiled by the California
  Department of Health Services on seroconversion rates in sentinel chicken
  flocks. Paired serum samples taken 2-3 wk apart showed increased titers to WEE
  between acute and convalescent sera in turkeys from three affected flocks.
  Convalescent sera were not available for testing from the fourth flock. WEE
  virus was isolated from one breeder hen submitted to the diagnostic laboratory
  during the early stages of the outbreak.

AB: An outbreak of diarrhea spanning 3 months occurred in a breeding colony of
  scid/Trp53 knockout mice. Approximately a third of the 150 mice were clinically
  affected, with signs ranging from mucoid or watery diarrhea to severe
  hemorrhagic diarrhea with mortality. Helicobacter bilis and the newly
  recognized urease-negative organism H. rodentium were isolated from
  microaerobic culture of feces or cecal specimens from affected mice. Dual
  infection with H. bilis and H. rodentium were confirmed by culture and
  polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in several animals. Both Helicobacter species
  rapidly colonized immunocompetent sentinel mice exposed to bedding from cages
  containing affected mice, but the sentinel remained asymptomatic. Mice with
  diarrhea had multifocal to segmental proliferative typhlitis, colitis, and
  proctitis. Several affected mice had multifocal mucosal necrosis with a few
  focal ulcers in the cecum, colon, and rectum. Mice with diarrhea were treated
  with antibiotic food wafers (1.5 mg of amoxicillin, 0.69 mg of metronidazole,
  and 0.185 mg of bismuth/mouse per day) previously shown to eradicate H.
  hepaticus in immunocompetent mice. Antibiotic treatment resulted in resolution
  of diarrhea, but not eradication of H. bilis and H. rodentium; mice continued
  to have positive PCR results after a 2-week treatment regimen, and clinical
  signs of diarrhea returned in some mice when treatment was suspended. To the
  authors' knowledge, this is the first report of natural infection with either
  H. bilis and/or H. rodentium causing acute diarrheal disease and suggests that
  H. bilis and/or H. rodentium can be an important pathogen for scid mice.

  Kapuskasing River, Ontario, Canada, where the presence of a hydro dam restricts
  the movement of fish between reference and exposure areas. Trout-perch
  collected downstream of the mill were shorter, lighter, and younger than
  upstream fish, whereas exposed white sucker were longer, heavier, and, for male
  sucker, older than reference fish. Only male trout-perch showed induced hepatic
  mixed function oxygenase activity (7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase). Both
  forskolin-stimulated in vitro production of 17 beta-estradiol in trout-perch
  and plasma concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol in sucker were significantly
  depressed in exposed fish. The inconsistency in responses between species made
  it difficult to determine how the opposing responses were related and which
  species was most sensitive to instream conditions. Despite the discrepancies,
  use of an interpretation framework indicated that both species identified
  similar potential problems (e.g., size-selective mortality and recruitment
  problems), suggesting that either species could be used as a sentinel species
  at this site.

AB: Larger fish species may not always be suitable for monitoring the response
  to industrial effluents because they are mobile and capable of extensive
  movement beyond effluent exposure areas. Spoonhead sculpin (Cottus ricei) was
  collected upstream and downstream of a large bleached-kraft pulp mill on the
  Athabasca River, Alberta, Canada, during fall and spring periods to determine
  whether small, sedentary fish species demonstrate responses reflecting local
  exposure conditions. During the fall sampling period, exposed fish were older
  and larger than upstream fish and showed increases in condition, gonad size,
  egg weight, liver weight, and hepatic mixed function oxygenase activity (7
  -ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase [EROD]). Sculpin collected from the opposite
  river bank, where exposure was reduced, showed condition factors, gonad size,
  egg weight, liver weight, and EROD activity that were not significantly
  different from reference sites or intermediate between reference and downstream
  values. In the spring after a prolonged overwinter exposure to higher effluent
  concentrations, exposed fish were larger, showed increased size-at-age,
  condition, liver weight, ovary size, and EROD activity. Far-field collections
  showed that most responses persisted downstream for at least 48 km. The general
  response of exposed spoonhead sculpin was consistent with a nutrient enrichment
  effect described in studies investigating water quality, algal growth, and
  benthos communities at this site but also may be related to reduced competition
  associated with the loss of older fish observed in the spring. The use of small
  species for sentinel monitoring provided a viable alternative to use.
 of
  larger, more mobile species.

AB: The ecology of western equine encephalomyelitis virus (WEE) was studied
  during 1994-1996 along a portion of the north shore of the Salton Sea in
  Coachella Valley, California, known to support a focal Aedes dorsalis (Meigen)
  population. WEE was detected during 1995 by the seroconversion of sentinel
  chickens concurrently at sites within and outside of the area supporting Ae.
  dorsalis. WEE was not detected during 1994 or 1996; neither was WEE detected by
  seroconversion of sentinel rabbits nor by isolation from host-seeking females
  of either the primary vector, Culex tarsalis Coquillett (42,083 females tested
  in 913 pools), or Ae. dorsalis (10,804 females tested in 245 pools and 1,940
  adults reared from field-collected immatures tested in 72 pools). Collectively,
  the results of this and previous investigations indicate that Ae. dorsalis may
  not be essential for the maintenance or amplification of WEE virus in
  southeastern California.

AB: Laboratory tests and field experiments were conducted to determine the
  functional response of Trichogramma ostriniae Pang & Chen to its host, eggs of
  the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner), under different
  conditions. Individual female wasps were offered different densities of host
  eggs for 16 h at 17, 20, and 27 degrees C. Field experiments were carried out
  in a sweet corn field that was divided into 6 plots of equal size (120 m2).
  Sentinel European corn borer egg masses were exposed to wasps for 3 d, from day
  0 to 3 and day 4 to 7 after releasing wasps. Both the laboratory study and
  field experiments indicated that egg parasitism was positively correlated with
  egg density. However, this relationship differed significantly for the 3
  temperatures in the laboratory study and varied considerably for the different
  days of exposures (days 0-3 versus days 4-7) and for different replicates (time
  of the year). The Gompertz equation and a modified disc equation were fitted to
  the laboratory data categorized based on temperatures. The results showed that
  female T. ostriniae might exhibit the type II or type III functional response
  depending on temperature. The field data suggested a type II functional
  response when data were pooled for all replicates.

AB: A case of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) was found in a farming area located
  in the southern part of Hokkaido, Japan, in 1993. TBE viruses were isolated
  from sentinel dogs in the area where the human case occurred in 1995. Ticks
  were collected in the area by 2 collection methods in 1995 and virus isolation
  was conducted on ticks in 1995 and 1996. Ixodes ovatus Neumann was found to be
  the predominant tick species in the area. In 1996, 2 virus strains were
  isolated from 600 I. ovatus ticks (300 females and 300 males), giving the
  minimum infection rate of 0.33% (2 of 600). The 2 virus strains were identified
  as TBE virus by antigenic analysis using monoclonal antibodies and the indirect
  immunofluorescent antibody test. The results showed that I. ovatus was a
  suspected vector of the emerging TBE virus in Hokkaido.

AB: The development of Aprostocetus hagenowii (Ratzeburg) in irradiated 2-wk-old
  Periplaneta americana (L.) oothecae yielded a significantly higher percentage
  of female-biased clutches than freeze-killed oothecae, but per clutch the
  number of females and males, sex ratio, and developmental time were not
  significantly different. In parasitoid development studies, ootheca age and the
  factor clutch significantly affected the number of female and male parasitoids
  per clutch; younger oothecae yielded more parasitoids than older oothecae.
  Weekly for 30 wk, parasitoids were released in blattid-infested treeholes.
  Parasitism of sentinel oothecae at release sites was higher than at control
  sites each week after the release program was initiated. From April to
  November, parasitism of sentinel oothecae in control treeholes was 10-40% but
  peaked at 46% the week of 7 July. Weekly winter (December through March)
  sentinel ootheca parasitism was <10%. Parasitism of sentinel oothecae in
  release treeholes remained higher for 10 of the 11 wk after parasitoid releases
  were terminated, indicating that naturally occurring oothecae, parasitized
  during the release program, served as inoculum for subsequent generations of
  parasitoids.

AB: To be informed about foodborne diseases is a basic requirement for the
  production of safe food. Establishing the patterns of disease facilitates
  policy decisions, provides a basis for legislative action and the development
  of intervention strategies, and helps to set priorities in relation to research
  investments. The information on foodborne diseases made available indicates
  that foodborne disease is increasing worldwide and that new and emerging
  problems get through current safety procedures. Reasons for this include the
  increasing globalization of food production and trade, the application of new
  process technologies, changing eating habits, and increasing human migration.
  However, additional and more adequate information is needed for a rapid
  recognition of new and emerging foodborne diseases. Information is also deemed
  necessary for a risk analysis approach to safe food production. This applies
  especially to identifying hazards and gaining information about dose-response
  relationships. There are several ways to obtain such information: (i) a more
  extended analysis of reported food-associated incidents of disease, including
  gaining information about the dose-response relationship, (ii) application of
  sentinel and population studies for specific pathogenic agents, (iii) case
  -control studies to identify and quantify risk factors, and (iv) calculation of
  human exposure and translating the exposure by dose-response relationship into
  disease. To protect the consumer, both food producers and governments have
  their responsibilities in actively collecting the necessary information about
  foodborne disease and where necessary actively making use of risk communication.

AB: This is the first part of a four-part series on foodborne disease
  surveillance. Although these articles are primarily built on expertise gained
  within North America, the substance is of value to any community or country
  wishing to initiate or improve its surveillance system. Foodborne disease
  surveillance is necessary for preventing further spread of foodborne disease
  and includes identifying and controlling outbreaks at the time they are
  occurring; gathering data on incidence of these diseases and prevalence of
  their etiologic agents, vehicles, and reservoirs; identifying factors that led
  to the outbreaks; providing a data bank for HACCP systems and risk assessments;
  estimating health and economic impacts of foodborne diseases; and providing
  information upon which to base rational food safety program goals and
  priorities. Reports of outbreaks by local health agencies to regional and,
  then, national agencies responsible for disease surveillance, laboratory
  isolations of certain foodborne pathogens from human beings, sentinel community
  studies, and hazard surveillance are the types of foodborne disease
  surveillance activities that are used to varying extents in Canada and the U.S.
  In recent years, some national surveillance reports have been collated
  internationally in Europe and Latin America. Surveillance at local,
  state/provincial, national, and international levels must be coordinated for
  effective and rapid transfer of data. Computer software can assist
  investigation and management of the information submitted through surveillance
  networks. Information summarized on individual reports usually includes (a)
  location of the event, (b) clinical data, (c) epidemiologic data, (d)
  laboratory findings, and.
 (e) results of on-site investigations. Each
  outbreak report should be subjected to critical review before classifying it
  into the various categories of surveillance data. Such a review would also be
  useful when comparing surveillance data from different places and intervals.
  Highlights of individual reports are tabulated as line listings that are the
  direct sources of surveillance data, which are the subject of the second and
  third parts of this series.

AB: The effect of major resistance genes (Bs1, Bs2, and Bs3) or gene
  combinations for resistance to bacterial spot of bell peppers (Xanthomonas
  campestris pv. vesicatoria) in 15 commercial cultivars on disease reduction and
  yield were studied during 1995 and 1996. Reaction of cultivars to specific
  races (races 1, 2, or 3) of the pathogen corresponded with seed company claims
  for resistance against these races. Races 1 to 4 were used as initial inoculum
  in 1995, and races 1 to 6 in 1996 field experiments. Cultivars with no known
  resistance genes to bacterial spot (e.g., Camelot, Jupiter, and Valiant), a
  single resistance gene (X3R Camelot, King Arthur), or a combination of Bs1 and
  Bs3 genes (Guardian, Sentinel, and Admiral) were severely diseased. Yields were
  reduced in all inoculated cultivars compared to non-inoculated cultivars used
  as controls. Although races 4 and 6 caused significant disease in cultivars
  with only Bs1 (King Arthur) or Bs2 (X3R Camelot) genes, cultivars with a
  combination of Bs1 and Bs2 (Boynton Bell, PR93008) had much lower levels of
  bacterial spot. Roger 4178, a hybrid with a combination of Bs1, Bs2, and Bs3
  genes, had the lowest disease ratings. Overall, race 3 was predominant during
  1995, while races 3 and 6 were recovered most frequently in 1996.

AB: Peach texture during storage is affected by temperature, humidity, and
  oxygen level. Four cultivars, 'Sentinel', 'Topaz', 'Parade and 'Fairtime', were
  stored at 0 C for 28 days after which time texture tests were done for the next
  four days during the peach's ripening at 25 C. A cylindrical peach specimen was
  penetrated with a wire probe installed in an Instron universal testing machine.
  From the force-displacement response, firmness parameters were determined and a
  fast fourier transform frequency analysis was performed to determine the
  jaggedness of the curves. Effegi firmness, Instron peak force, and spectrum
  area changed the most during ripening. The lowest frequency ratio (0 to 0.19
  Hz) changed more than any other frequency ratio during ripening. Significant
  decreases in Effegi firmness and in Instron peak force, steady state force, and
  frequency ratio were observed between the first and the second day of ripening
  but the changes were not significant thereafter. After one day of ripening,
  late season cultivars 'Fairtime' and 'Parade' were significantly less firm than
  'Topaz'. Most parameters indicated that 'Sentinel' an early season cultivar,
  was firm like 'Topaz', a mid-season cultivar. After two days, differences in
  firmness parameters among the four cultivars were not significant.

AB: In 1992, sentinel squash plants treated with carbofuran successfully
  attracted and killed squash bug, Anasa tristis (De Geer), and cucumber beetle,
  Acalymma vittatum (F.), emerging from overwintering at 5 locations in Atoka
  County, Oklahoma. In 1993, responses of cucumber beetle and squash bug to
  carbofuran-treated squash trap plants and to Adios or Adios-AG attracticidal
  baits were compared in <1.0-ha plots of seedling cantaloupe, squash, and
  watermelon at Lane, OK. Regardless of crop, cucumber beetles and squash bug
  populations were highly attracted to 'Lemondrop' squash trap plants that
  amounted to <1% of the total crop area. Squash trap-plants attracted an
  estimated 39.7, 32.4, and 66.3% of the cucumber beetle population,
  respectively, observed in fields of cantaloupe, squash, and watermelon
  seedlings. In cantaloupe and watermelon, squash trap-plants attracted >90% of
  the estimated squash bug population but were less effective in squash. In all
  cases, squash trap plants treated with carbofuran killed >90 and 16-37%,
  respectively, of the cucumber beetles and squash bugs found on the plants.
  Single applications of attracticidal baits provided up to 70% cucumber beetle
  mortality for 3-5-d post treatment. Studies conducted in 1994 showed that
  significantly greater numbers of cucumber beetles, primarily Diabrotica
  undecimpunctata howardii Barber, were attracted to 'Blue Hubbard' than
  Lemondrop squash trap plants that were treated with systemic insecticides,
  carbofuran at 0.15 g (AI) or imidacloprid at 0.04 g (AI), and positioned in a
  field of watermelon. Imidacloprid was as effective as carbofuran, each provided
  >90% cucumber beetle mortality. In this study, an.
 estimated 46.7% of the
  total cucumber beetle population was attracted to the squash trap plants.
  Results from these studies suggest that minimal plantings of systemically
  treated squash can be used effectively to suppress early-season populations of
  cucumber beetle and squash bug in seedling cantaloupe, squash, and watermelon.

AB: Laboratory assays were used to compare the ability of commercially produced
  Trichogramma spp. to parasitize eggs of the obliquebanded leafroller,
  Choristoneura rosaceana (Harris), in the laboratory and field. Trichogramma
  platneri Nagarkatti parasitized more obliquebanded leafroller eggs per egg mass
  than did Trichogramma pretiosum Riley or Trichogramma minutum Riley produced by
  either of 2 insectaries. T. minutum produced at 1 insectary caused
  significantly more host mortality by host feeding and repiercing than by
  parasitism. Variation in parasitoid performance from different insectaries and
  among shipments from the same insectary was common. Young egg masses were more
  heavily parasitized than old egg masses. Parasitism increased as the number of
  conspecific female Trichogramma spp. placed on the same host increased, but the
  number of eggs parasitized per female decreased. Exposure of host egg masses to
  female Trichogramma spp. prevented additional oviposition in the same egg mass
  by conspecific, ovipositionally experienced females but had no effect on
  parasitism by conspecific, ovipositionally naive females. The method used to
  attach sentinel egg masses to foliage influenced parasitism rates. Moistening
  the leaf with water and adhering the egg mass to the moistened leaf had the
  least impact. Inundative releases of Trichogramma spp. into an apple orchard
  paralleled laboratory assays by showing greater parasitism of obliquebanded
  leafroller egg masses by T. platneri than with T. minutum. However, extreme
  differences observed in field performance between the 2 species was not
  predicted from the assays.

AB: To identify putative persistent bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV)
  infections in cattle, seven cattle that had experienced BRSV infections were
  treated with corticosteroids for two periods of 5 days. During the 5-day
  periods and the 3 weeks after treatment, attempts were made to isolate BRSV
  from lung lavage fluid and nasal swab specimens. Fluorescent antibody tests
  were used to detect BRSV antigen in lung lavage cells. A BRSV specific
  polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed, and was performed on lung
  lavage samples of all seven cattle as well as on various tissues of five of the
  cattle. In addition, nasal swabs of 74 over-one-year-old cattle, in a closed
  dairy herd were also assayed by PCR. The virus or its RNA was not detected in
  putative carriers, by any of the methods used, whereas all positive controls
  were positive. After corticosteroid treatment, three of the seven cattle showed
  a four-fold rise in antibody titre, suggesting induction of virus replication.
  BRSV-seronegative sentinel calves, that were housed together with each
  corticosteroid-treated animal, did not develop antibodies to BRSV indicating
  that BRSV was not shed by corticosteroid-treated cattle, or was shed at a very
  low level. In addition BRSV was not detected in seropositive cattle in a closed
  farm in summer. Although we consider the rises in antibody titres against BRSV
  an indication for persistence of BRSV in cattle, BRSV or its RNA was not
  detected in infected cattle.

AB: Twelve red maple selections in an existing field trial were evaluated for

  concentration with a LECO CHN analyzer, and total foliar chlorophyll content
  (CHL) by N,N-dimethylformamide extraction. Selections included Acer rubrum L.
  'Autumn Flame', 'Fairview Flame', 'Franksred' (Red Sunset), 'Karpick',
  'Northwood', 'October Glory', 'Redskin', 'Schlesingeri', and 'Tilford', and A.
  xfreemanii E. Murray 'Autumn Blaze' ('Jeffersred'), 'Morgan' ('Indian Summer'),
  and 'Scarsen' (Scarlet Sentinel). 'Franksred' and 'Northwood' had the highest
  monthly SPAD-502 values in 1993 and 1994. Lowest SPAD-502 values were on
  'Redskin' and 'Autumn Blaze' each year. Foliar N concentration ranged from
  2.62% for 'Autumn Flame' to 2.01% for Redskin. CHL levels on a fresh-weight
  basis ranged from 5.38 mg.g-1 for 'Fairview Flame' to 3.94 mg.g-1 for 'October
  Glory'. SPAD-502 and extractable CHL values were correlated (r = 0.45; P less
  than or equal to 0.001); however, the correlation (r = 0.15; P less than or
  equal to 0.38) between SPAD-502 values and total foliar N concentration was
  nonsignificant.

AB: Western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE) and St. Louis encephalitis (SLE)
  viruses were detected in the Imperial Valley during the summers of 1991-1994 by
  isolation from the primary vector, Culex tarsalis Coquillett, and by the
  seroconversion of sentinel chickens. Enzootic transmission consistently was not
  detected first each year at sampling sites near specific landscape features
  such as a heron rookery and other riparian habitats along the New River, sites
  along the Mexican border, or saline and freshwater marshes along the southern
  shore of the Salton Sea. Despite mild winter temperatures and the elevated
  vernal abundance of Cx. tarsalis, WEE and SLE activity was not detected until
  June or July, indicating considerable amplification may be necessary before
  detection by testing mosquito pools for virus infection or sentinel chicken
  sera for antibodies. Results did not permit the spatial focusing of early
  season control efforts or research on mechanisms of virus interseasonal
  persistence.

AB: In separate trials, layer pullets were vaccinated with Mycoplasma
  gallisepticum (MG) strain 6/85 or strain ts-11 commercially produced live
  vaccines. For a 15-wk postvaccination (PV) period, vaccinates were commingled
  with unvaccinated pullets and were in indirect contact with sentinel groups of
  pullets, broiler breeders, turkey breeders, or meat turkeys in adjoining pens.
  Infectivity and transmissibility of vaccine strains were determined by tracheal
  culture and serology at 1 wk followed by 3-wk intervals PV. Strain 6/85 was
  recovered from 0%-20% of vaccinates, but not from commingled pullets or
  sentinel birds. Strain ts-11 was recovered from 60%-90% of vaccinates and 0%
  -40% of commingled pullets but not from any of the sentinel birds. No birds in
  the 6/85 vaccine trial tested positive for MG antibodies by serology. MG enzyme
  -linked immunosorbent assays detected positive responses in ts-11 vaccinates
  (range = 10%-70%) at 42, 63, 84, and 105 days PV, and commingled pullets (10%)
  at 84 and 105 days PV MG serum plate agglutination tests detected positive
  responses in 90% and 20% of ts-11 vaccinates at 42 and 105 days PV,
  respectively, and commingled pullets (10%) at day 42 PV. Clinical signs,
  morbidity or mortality suggestive of pathogenic MG infection were not observed
  in any bird during either trial, and no gross lesions were observed at
  necropsy. Random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis was capable of
  distinguishing each of the vaccinal strains 6/85 and ts-11 from each other by
  their distinct DNA banding patterns.

AB: Recent outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis and reports of other newly described
  parasitic diseases associated with drinking water transmission prompted a
  reevaluation of source water monitoring criteria for public health protection.
  The field of microbial indicators was reviewed and each candidate sentinel
  evaluated in terms of its sensitivity, specificity, and technical feasibility.
  In addition, a clear distinction was made between source water monitoring and
  monitoring in the distribution system. Of all potential candidate microbial
  sentinels, Escherichia coli is deemed the most efficacious for public health
  protection. Based on a conservative estimate of its half-life in groundwater
  for 8 d, it is recommended that at least two samples be obtained during this
  half-life. In addition to E. coli, two water quality indicator sentinels, which
  are not necessarily direct public health threats, should also be monitored at
  the same frequency. These are the total coliform group and the enterococci. If
  E. coli is present in any source water sample, the borehole and any directly
  connected borehole should be embargoed. If either total coliforms or
  enterococci are detected, only that individual borehole should be taken off
  line and not used until the situation is remediated and the cause of the fecal
  contamination eliminated. Clostridium perfringens spores serve as a useful long
  -lived indicator. However, their perseverance in a sample should not be
  considered a direct public health threat because spores may far outlive
  pathogens. As a parasite indicator, C. perfringens should have the same
  importance as a positive coliform or enterococcus analysis. Coliphages do not
  yet fulfill enough of the criteria to be.
 routinely employed. Biological
  monitoring should be coupled with physicochemical monitoring to establish a
  long-term history of the source. Because all natural waters vary in the amounts
  of heterotrophic plate count bacteria, test methods should be employed that are
  refractory to them. A combination of rigorous source protection plus
  extraordinary source monitoring serve as sufficient multiple barriers for
  parasite protection.

AB: This paper presents evidence supporting the view that in the past natural
  fungal poisons (mycotoxins) in moldy grain strongly influenced variations in
  fertility and mortality rates. The poisons that influenced fertility may have
  reduced conceptions and increased spontaneous abortions. Those that influenced
  mortality may have damaged the immune system. In particular, tuberculosis, the
  most common cause of death, may have been a sentinel disease for immune system
  damage by mycotoxins. It is unlikely that any one formula (specifying the
  amounts of each predictor variable) will be found that can predict fertility
  and mortality over wide areas or long time periods. However, by using just
  three kinds of variables--climatic, dietetic and economic--it may be possible
  to predict more than half of the variation in fertility and tuberculosis
  mortality up to 1900 in Europe and America. The evidence presented supports the
  view that the two principal factors influencing natural population increase in
  Connecticut during 1660-1900 were (1) increased consumption of potatoes and (2)
  improvement in transportation systems.

AB: A case of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) has not been reported for many years
  in Japan, although a serological survey of sera from domestic animals suggested
  the presence of TBE foci in Hokkaido, the northern island of Japan. Studies
  were conducted to prove the presence of an endemic focus of TBE virus in Japan
  by means of serology and virus isolation. In October 1993 in Hokkaido, a severe
  case of encephalitis in a dairy farmer's wife was diagnosed as TBE. Serological
  examination of paired serum specimens showed a rise in the neutralization
  antibody titer to Russian spring summer encephalitis virus. A
  seroepizootiological survey of dogs showed that the TBE-related virus was
  prevalent in the area. Three virus isolates were obtained from the blood of
  sentinel dogs, and antigenic analysis grouped the isolates into TBE-related
  viruses. Sequence analysis of the envelope protein gene identified one of the
  isolates as being of the same subtype as the Russian spring summer encephalitis
  (Far Eastern TBE) virus. The results provide evidence that TBE is endemic in a
  certain area of Japan.

AB: Inoculative releases of Lagenidium giganteum (California isolate) were made
  against a population of Mansonia dyari during a typical breeding season at one
  site in eastern Hillsborough County, Florida. Zoospores of L. giganteum were
  introduced into outdoor caged replicated test pools containing waterlettuce
  Pistia stratiotes, and larvae of M. dyari collected from an inactive phosphate
  pit. First and second instar larvae were added twice a week between August and
  December, 1993, to simulate natural oviposition by M. dyari. Adult emergence
  was reduced by >77% in test pools treated with L. giganteum. Sentinel larvae
  provided evidence of recycling of the fungus approximately 14 days
  posttreatment. Continuous larval mortality of M. dyari was observed for a
  period of 46 days. Our data showed that water quality in the test pools and
  phosphate pit was suitable for fungal growth and zoosporogenesis as long as the
  water temperature did not exceed 38 degrees C.

AB: Six red maple (Acer rubrum L.) and four Freeman maple (A. X freemanii E.
  Murray) cultivars were compared for rooting of single-node stem cuttings and
  subsequent development of rooted cuttings. Cuttings were taken in May 1990 and
  1991 and treated with either 3 or 8 g IBA/kg. Rooting after 4 weeks differed
  among cultivars, ranging from 22% for 'Karpick' to 100% for 'Schlesinger' over
  both years. Rooting scores, based on root counts and lengths, were highest for
  'Schlesinger' and lowest for 'Scarlet Sentinel' and 'Karpick'. IBA at 8 g.kg-1
  resulted in better rooting than at 3 g.kg-1. Mean length of shoots formed on
  potted rooted cuttings was 22.6 cm for 'Franksred', which initiated shoots on
  100% of the cuttings that rooted. In contrast, < 50 % of 'Armstrong',
  'Jeffersred', 'Karpick', 'Northwood', and 'Scarlet Sentinel' rooted cuttings
  initiated shoots, and mean length of new shoots was < 4 cm for these cultivars.
  The amount of leaf desiccation that occurred after removing cuttings from the
  propagation bench varied among cultivars, and the percentage of viable leaf
  surface area correlated positively with final root or shoot dry mass for all
  cultivars.

AB: A regional surveillance system for eastern equine encephalitis (EKE) virus
  was established in central New York in 1984 after the 2nd human EKE fatality
  occurred in 1983. Extensive mosquito surveillance activities were coordinated
  with the rapid laboratory processing of mosquito specimens for EKE virus.
  Active surveillance for EKE infections in humans and equines also was
  initiated. Results of long-term surveillance detected the presence of multiple
  Culiseta breeding swamps. A 6-yr interepizootic period (1984-1989) was followed
  by 2 yr of equine EKE. In 1990, there were 7 equine cases and a record number
  of EKE virus isolations from mosquitoes (n = 86), wild birds (n = 27), and
  sentinel pheasants (n = 7). In 1991, 7 equine cases also occurred, although
  there were fewer isolations from mosquitoes (n = 40). The sequence to the
  appearance of EKE virus at swamp and upland sites and at individual swamp
  complexes, and the spatial and temporal distribution of equine cases provide
  evidence for multiple foci of EKE virus in central New York. The role of
  infected Culiseta melanura (Coquillett) in the transfer of EKE virus between
  swamp and upland areas and among swamp complexes is advanced.

AB: Rats were fed on four semi-purified diets in which raw or cooked peas (Pisum
  sativum var. Sentinel) provided 250 or 500 g/kg diet. Pressure-cooking of peas
  followed by rapid freezing and freeze-drying increased the proportion of starch
  resistant to alpha-amylase (EC 3.2.1.1) without previous treatment with
  dimethyl sulphoxide. There were only minor effects of cooking on the
  digestibilities of non-starch polysaccharides and their constituent sugars.
  With the higher dietary pea concentration there were marked increases in the
  flow of organic matter to, and fermentation in, the large bowel. These
  increases were associated with significant increases in colonic tissue and
  contents weights, and in colonic transit time. Both cooking and dietary pea
  inclusion rate altered the pattern of volatile fatty acids in caecal contents
  and in portal blood.

AB: Sentinel chickens were maintained at field sites in 40 Florida counties for
  varying periods between 1978 and 1993. For each county, the total number of St.
  Louis encephalitis virus (SLE) or eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus
  seroconversions were divided by the number of chickens exposed to calculate a
  mean annual seroconversion rate. These rates were used to evaluate the annual
  and geographical distributions of these viruses within Florida. For SLE, the
  rates in counties that reported human SLE cases during a widespread epidemic in
  1990 were compared with adjusted mean annual seroconversion rates calculated by
  excluding the epidemic year seroconversion data. In general, actual rates were
  higher than adjusted rates in counties where human SLE cases were reported in
  1990. Similar calculations were made for EEE virus that was unusually abundant
  in northern Florida during the spring and summer of 1991. In general, EEE virus
  was distributed in the panhandle and northern regions and SLE virus in the
  central and southern regions of the state. However, this distribution was not
  exclusive, and during years of high transmission, either virus can extend
  beyond its normal range. The annual distribution of SLE and EEE viruses was
  sporadic, ranging from years with little detectable activity to years with
  widespread, high-level transmission.

AB: On three consecutive days, six pigs were exposed for 15 minutes to aerosols
  of Aujeszky's disease virus. The total estimated dose was 45 log10 TCID50.
  Within each isolation room, a sentinel pig was placed on a deck two feet away
  from the infected pig. The breath of the pigs that had inhaled the aerosols was
  collected on days 3, 7 and 13. The respiratory and other clinical signs of the
  infected pigs resembled those in field cases of Aujeszky's disease. All the
  pigs infected with Aujeszky's disease virus seroconverted within seven to 10
  days after infection. Among the sentinel pigs, clinical signs were minimal and
  only three seroconverted.

AB: The environmental stability and transmission of a field isolate of rat virus
  was tested under conditions resembling those that may be encountered during the
  housing of laboratory rats. The rat virus kept in physiologic salt solutions at
  room temperature remained infective for at least 5 weeks. Similar virus
  preparations remained infective after drying on a plastic surface for 3 to 5
  weeks, depending on initial virus concentration. Varying the protein
  concentration in the medium had no significant effect on stability. Bedding
  from cages housing infected litters induced seroconversions in sentinel rats
  for at least 5 weeks after storage of rat virus at room temperature. Infection
  was transmitted between rats housed in open cages in a Trexler isolator but not
  between rats housed in microisolator cages connected by tunnels partitioned by
  wire screens with mesh size of 1.67 mm. The results indicate that rat virus can
  remain infective after prolonged exposure to an ambient environment and suggest
  that infection is more readily transmitted by animal-to-animal contact or by
  fomites than by aerosolization of exhaled virus.

AB: Objective: To assess possible changes in the incidence of diabetes in all
  age-groups in The Netherlands during a 10-year period (1980-1983/1990-1992).
  Result and design and methods: Since 1970, a network of sentinel stations (the
  Dutch Sentinel Practice Network) consisting of approximately 1% of the Dutch
  population has been in operation to gain insight into the morbidity patterns of
  the Dutch population as recorded by general practitioners. One of the items
  recorded from 1990 to 1992 was the incidence of diabetes. The first study with
  a similar design that registered the incidence of diabetes was conducted from
  1980 to 1983. Results: The overall incidence of diabetes increased
  significantly by 12.1% in the period between the two studies. This overall
  increase can largely be attributed to a statistically significant increase in
  the age-group 45-64 years (30.5%). Although not statistically significant, the
  36% increase of diabetes in the age-group 0-19 years is in accordance with the
  increase of type I diabetes based on the first and second nationwide
  retrospective studies covering the total Dutch population. Conclusions: There
  is a marked increase in the incidence of diabetes in the age-group 45-64 years.
  This selective increase is probably not due to a real rise caused by changes in
  exposure to risk factors but to an earlier recognition of symptoms and signs of
  diabetes followed by blood glucose measurements and/or to more intensive case
  finding in general practice.

AB: In regions of highly diversified agriculture, herbicides used in one field
  may not be compatible with crops growing in nearby fields. Injury to nontarget
  crops may occur from drift or localized atmospheric transport of herbicide
  residues. Pea, bean, and corn seedlings have been used as sentinels to detect
  atmospheric deposition of trace residues. Seedlings were exposed at various
  locations throughout south central Washington and exchanged on a weekly basis
  with a new set of plants. Plants were returned to a lath house and observed
  over 3 weeks for development of symptoms indicative of probable exposure to
  four classes of herbicides- sulfonylureas, phenoxyacetates, aminophosphonic
  acids, and bipyridiliniums. The most frequently observed symptoms on sentinel
  plants were chlorotic spots on the upper leaf surfaces; such symptoms were
  created under controlled conditions by exposing plants to aerosols of the
  sulfonylurea (SU) herbicide chlorsulfuron. For 3 years, the greatest incidence
  of probable SU symptoms was detected during April; however, occurrence of
  symptoms was not correlated with periods of maximum use of SU herbicides on
  wheat in the region. The results suggested a general atmospheric loading of
  herbicides with occasional deposition, rather than point source drift. Further
  tests are needed to quantitate the exposures of sentinel plants and determine
  if chlorotic spots are associated with adverse physiological effects.

AB: A foodborne-disease surveillance program is an essential part of a food
  safety program. Foodborne surveillance should be able to issue early alerts on
  contaminated food to which a large population is exposed; collate notifications
  of enteric diseases and laboratory isolations; report foodborne disease
  incidents on a regular basis; and use sentinel and specific epidemiological
  studies as required. Although most countries have some kind of reporting of
  notifiable diseases, few have foodborne-disease surveillance programs, and
  little is known of foodborne disease in general on a worldwide basis. However,
  in the last decade many European countries have generated annual reports to
  join those of Canada, England/Wales, Japan and the United States. In addition,
  a few other countries are attempting to develop foodborne-disease reporting
  programs but are hampered by lack of resources. However, it is apparent that
  staphylococcal intoxication has been decreasing in most nations, except in some
  Latin American countries where cheese from unpasteurized milk and cream-filled
  desserts are widely consumed. In contrast, salmonellosis has been increasing or
  remaining steady as the main foodborne disease in practically all other
  countries. Newly-recognized agents such as E. coli O157:H7 and other
  verotoxigenic E. coli, or previously-known agents in new food associations such
  as Clostridium botulinum, are also being documented in several countries.
  Although the socioeconomic impact of foodborne diseases is very high, there are
  at best limited effective control measures to reduce them, even in
  industrialized countries. One reason control is difficult to achieve is that
  surveillance is inadequate and the.
 burden of foodborne disease is not fully
  understood by policy-makers. Another reason is that a consistent and
  coordinated effort by industry and government is required, as has been
  practiced in Sweden to reduce substantially the Salmonella contamination of
  poultry. Improvement of surveillance on a worldwide basis is all the more
  important with increasing world trade and travel, and international
  organizations need to take a lead role in accomplishing this.

AB: A recently colonized gregarious species of Muscidifurax near raptorellus
  (Kogan and Legner) from eastern Nebraska was evaluated in the field for its
  potential as a biological control agent for the house fly (Musca domestica L.)
  and stable fly (Stomoxys calcitrans (L.)). Muscidifurax sp. was released at
  three beef cattle feedlot pens, three times at 3-week intervals at 50,000,
  100,000, or 200,000 parasitized hosts per treatment. Mean host mortality in
  sentinel house fly pupae reached 94% 2 weeks after the first release, but
  parasitism decreased to 72% after 3 weeks. Similar trends were observed with
  the second and third releases. Also, large numbers of parasite progeny were
  recovered from sentinel cohorts, suggesting that many of the released parasites
  found the sentinel pupae. Parasitism by Muscidifurax sp. was substantially
  lower, 27.4 and 12.2%, respectively, in naturally occurring house fly and
  stable fly pupae than that observed in sentinel hosts. Little correlation was
  evident between mean host mortality and a given parasite release rate. This
  Muscidifurax sp. has a high reproductive capacity, is easily reared, and
  appears to be one of the more effective species commercially available for fly
  control on midwestern beef and dairy cattle confinements.

AB: Population dynamics and bionomics of host-seeking Culex tarsalis Coquillett
  were studied in the Imperial and Coachella valleys of California during periods
  in 1991 and 1992 when western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE) and St. Louis
  encephalitis (SLE) viruses were transmitted to sentinel chickens. Female
  abundance was greatest during the spring and fall, before and after most virus
  transmission occurred and was not correlated with temperature, humidity, or
  rainfall. Parity rates were highest during late summer when virus activity
  peaked and were lowest during December when females may enter a short-term
  reproductive diapause. Although most likely underestimated, the proportion of
  older multiparous females were collected at a consistent, but low level
  throughout the year. Changes in the parity rate seemed to be influenced
  primarily by the proportions of 1-parous females. Survivorship estimated from
  the parity rate (adjusted to account for autogeny) was highest in winter;
  however, the proportion of females surviving to potentially transmit either WEE
  or SLE virus was highest in summer and early fall. Wing length decreased in
  summer as an inverse correlate of temperature and increased as a function of
  female age, implying that larger females lived longest. However, autogenous
  females were larger than anautogenous females at emergence and only parous
  autogenous females were collected host seeking, thereby confounding the
  relationship between size and age. The proportion of females testing positive
  for fructose was greatest during winter and lowest during summer, perhaps
  affecting survivorship and blood-feeding avidity. The vector competence
  (infection, dissemination and.
 transmission rates, and ID50) of females
  collected host seeking or emerging from field-collected pupae for WEE or SLE
  viruses remained similar over time, even though the wing length of females used
  in these experiments differed among samples. We conclude that in nature virus
  transmission progressed efficiently during midsummer because elevated
  temperatures shortened the extrinsic incubation period without markedly
  decreasing survivorship resulting in an increased proportion of females
  surviving extrinsic incubation to become infective.

  Valley during 1991 and 1992 were detected by testing pools of host-seeking
  Culex tarsalis Coquillett for virus infection and sentinel chickens for
  seroconversions. Both viruses repeatedly were detected first at a salt marsh
  adjacent to the Salton Sea in the southeastern comer of the study area and then
  disseminated to the northwest to freshwater marsh, agricultural, and
  residential habitats. Virus dissemination was relatively slow (<1 km/d) and may
  have been accomplished by dispersive host-seeking mosquitoes. Repeated early
  -season recovery of virus activity indicated that both viruses may persist
  interseasonally in salt marsh habitat.

AB: Consistent temporal and spatial patterns in the activity of Culex tarsalis
  Coquillett and western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE) and St. Louis
  encephalitis (SLE) viruses were delineated that were useful in developing a
  stratified surveillance program. Vernal increases in Cx. tarsalis abundance
  typically were associated with flooding of saline marshes along the north shore
  of the Salton Sea and were followed 6-8 wk later by the onset of WEE and SLE
  virus activity. Viruses then spread to managed marsh (duck club) and
  agricultural habitats in the Whitewater Channel flood plain and, depending upon
  the intensity of amplification, to agricultural and residential areas in the
  more elevated northwestern portion of the valley. Mean annual Cx. tarsalis
  abundance was correlated inversely with elevation and distance from the Salton
  Sea. Abundance was greatest at managed marsh habitats. Although spatially
  correlated with vector abundance among sites, virus transmission rates to
  sentinel chickens were asynchronous temporally with vector abundance.
  Seroconversion rates were related to flock location but not flock size (10
  versus 20 chickens). Human cases were not detected during the study period,
  despite elevated transmission rates of both WEE and SLE viruses to sentinel
  chickens positioned in peridomestic habitats.

AB: To develop a system to be used for confirming diagnosis of Tyzzer's disease
  in seropositive rat colonies, 38 Mol:SPRD, BB/Wor/Mol-BB, and Stroke-Prone rats
  suffering from megaloileitis were examined. All affected rats had been found by
  a systematic examination of 5-week-old male rats from barrier-protected
  colonies, sero-positive to Bacillus piliformis, the agent of Tyzzer's disease.
  The rats were evaluated by serologic testing, histologic examination of the
  ileum, liver, and heart (hematoxylin and eosin and Warthin-Starry staining),
  and immunofluorescence staining of tissue smears of the ileum and liver. The
  presence of B. piliformis was verified in 24 of the rats. All animals that had
  the agent in the liver or heart also had it in the ileum. The sensitivity of
  immunofluorescence staining for identification of the agent was higher than
  that for Warthin-Starry staining. Thirty-seven rats had histologic changes
  indicative of Tyzzer's disease in the liver, and 23 had histologic changes in
  the myocardium. All rats had a high titer of antibodies against B. piliformis.
  Having verified the presence of the agent, germ-free sentinels were placed in
  one of the colonies. These also became infected, as did germ-free sentinels
  caged with the infected rats outside the barrier unit. The number of sentinels
  infected increased with the age of the sentinels at introduction. To prove the
  absence of Tyzzer's disease in a seropositive colony, it is considered
  necessary to examine approximately 3,000 6-week-old rats for abdominal
  distension and demonstrate negative staining of the ileum for B. piliformis.

AB: Dispersal of the Old World screw-worm fly, Chrysomya bezziana Villeneuve,
  was studied in Papua New Guinea by releasing radio-isotope labelled, laboratory
  -reared flies and collecting their labelled egg masses from sentinel cattle. A
  log-linear model was developed to describe recapture rate. Distance was found
  to dominate the model and was represented by a bilinear ('broken-stick') term
  as log-distance. Further terms in the model such as attractiveness of the site
  (estimated from the number of non-labelled egg masses), the season of the year
  and a time trend were statistically significant but of minor importance. From
  the model, the median distance females dispersed before depositing an egg mass
  was 10.8 km. The maximum distance from the release site that egg masses were
  recovered was 100 km. The dispersal ability of C. bezziana is discussed in
  terms of its impact on the prospects of eradicating this species using SIRM if
  an outbreak occurred in Australia.

AB: An 8.1-ha field of 2-wk-old cabbage within an area of general cabbage
  production received a single treatment with 8100 m of a continuous-rope
  formulation of a 70:30 mixture of (Z)-ll-hexadecenal and (Z)-ll-hexadecen-l
  -olacetate, two components of the sex pheromone of the female diamondback moth,
  Plutella xylostella (L.). Captures of males in synthehc pheromone-baited traps,
  mating of laboratory-reared sentinel females, and the mated status of native
  moths taken from the plots demonstrated suppression of mating activity by the
  pheromone treatment relative to that in the control area for 9 wk. Cabbage in
  this farm was planted sequentially. Fifteen insecticide treatments were applied
  during production of the block of cabbage, planted 13 d before the pheromone
  -treated cabbage, and 13 applications were made to the adjacent (control) block
  of cabbage planted 3 d after that in the pheromone plot. Two insecticide
  treatments were applied to plants in the pheromone-treated block to control
  diamondback moth larvae resident at the time of the pheromone application, and
  one spray was applied to this block 10 wk later at harvest. Cabbage at the
  extreme perimeter of the pheromone-treated area was damaged heavily by
  diamondback larvae; however, larval and pupal counts throughout most of this
  plot remained comparable to those in the control area. Cabbage at the interior
  of the pheromone area was graded as U.S. no. 1 quality. The results indicate
  that mating disruption can be used to protect cabbage from diamondback moth if
  pheromones are applied to areas of at least 8.1 ha with some supplemental
  application of insecticide.

  Trypanosoma vivax was widely but unevenly distributed within the study area and
  that incidence ranged from sporadic transmission to localised epidemics in
  which virtually all susceptible animals become infected within a period of 3
  months. Quantitative epidemiological methods substantiated impressions of
  previous workers that T. vivax infections were associated with low-lying swampy
  areas and tabanid activity. vert clinical trypanosomosis was rare in herds in
  which T. vivax was endemic. However, in these herds primary T. vivax infections
  were shown to cause subclinical alterations in calves. The infection
  consistently caused a temporary depression of packed cell volume (PCV) as well
  as a reduction in growth rate. There was no evidence of compensatory growth at
  a later stage.

AB: A digoxigenin-labeled cloned infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) DNA
  fragment was evaluated as a nonradioactive alternative probe in the diagnosis
  of infectious laryngotracheitis. The dot-blot hybridization protocol was
  optimized and was capable of detecting 40 pg of purified ILTV DNA and as few as
  50 ILTV-infected chicken embryo liver cells. The utility of this approach for
  diagnostic use was evaluated through four ILTV inoculation trials using a mild
  field isolate, a virulent challenge strain, a tissue-culture-origin vaccine,
  and an egg-origin vaccine. Birds were examined for clinical signs of ILT, and
  conjunctival and pharyngeal swabs from inoculated and sentinel birds were
  tested for ILTV by the digoxigenin-labeled probe and by virus isolation. In
  general, higher numbers of ILTV positive samples were detected by both assays
  from conjunctival swabs. For the non-vaccine strains, detection by dot-blot
  hybridization was equivalent to that for virus isolation However, for the two
  vaccine strains, there was some lack of correlation between the dot-blot
  results and the virus-isolation results. The kappa values between virus
  -isolation results and dot-blot results for the tissue-culture-origin vaccine,
  egg-origin vaccine, Ont 1598 field isolate, and virulent strain were 0.00,
  0.16, 0.39, and 0.24, respectively, for pharyngeal samples and 0.19, 0.29,
  0.58, and 0.48, respectively, for conjunctival samples.

AB: Pathogen-free sentinel mice were placed in 7 animal rooms with different
  housing conditions and were serologically screened for antibodies to mouse
  hepatitis virus (MHV), pneumonia virus of mice (PVM), Sendai virus, reovirus 3,
  Theiler's mouse encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), ectromelia virus and Mycoplasma
  pulmonis by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, at intervals after
  introduction. The most commonly detected antibody was against MHV, which was
  found in mice from 4 rooms, followed by PVM antibody in mice from 3 rooms.
  Seroconversion to Sendai virus and TMEV was detected in mice from one room
  each. No seroconversion to any of the antigens was found in 2 rooms. The common
  criteria of these 2 rooms were that they housed pathogen-free animals from a
  single source and that the access to the rooms was, purposely or not,
  restricted to people who had no contact to other miee. The study demonstrated
  the importance of husbandry and hygiene regimen on the prevalence of infectious
  agents in laboratory mice.

  Abscesses, mostly in the head and neck, developed in at least a third of all

  feeding of 110 and 220 mg of CTC/kg of feed began 5 weeks after exposure of
  principals to GES and feeding of 440 mg of CTC/kg of feed began 6 weeks after
  exposure.  One or more cohabitating sentinel swine of experiment 1 and one or
  more sentinels in all groups of principals of experiment 2, except group 2,
  developed abscesses that were mostly in the head and neck.  In experiment 2,
  correlation between serum GES antibody titer and development of one or more
  abscesses in the principals was highly significant (P < 0.01); however,
  correlation between antibody titer and abscesses in the sentinels only
  approached significance (P < 0.10).

AB: We report the findings of a 12-year surveillance study (1977-89) of avian
  influenza A viruses in eastern Germany. Viruses were isolated directly from
  feral ducks (n = 236) and other wild birds (n = 89); from domestic ducks (n =
  735) living on a single farm; and from white Pekin ducks (n = 193) used as
  sentinels for populations of wild aquatic birds; mainly sea birds. The
  efficiency of virus isolation was 9.9% overall, with considerable variability
  noted among species: 8.7% in wild ducks, 0.9% in other feral birds and 38% in
  Pekin ducks. Use of sentinel ducks in wild pelagic bird colonies improved virus
  detection rates fivefold, suggesting that this approach is advantageous in
  ecological studies. Among the 40 different combinations of hemagglutinin (HA)
  and neuraminidase (NA) subtypes we identified, H6N1 predominated (23.6% for all
  avian species), followed by H4N6 (11%). Among individual species, the frequency
  profiles favored H2N3 (20.8%) and H4N6 (20.3%) in feral ducks; H7N7 (22.3%),
  H4N6 (24.4%) and H2N3 (10.4%) in Pekin ducks used as sentinels; and H6N1
  (34.8%) and H6N6 (15.1%) in domestic ducks maintained on a single farm. By
  relying on sentinel birds for serological assays, it was possible to trace an
  "influenza season" in feral swan populations, beginning in August and
  continuing through the winter months. Comparison of subtype distribution of
  influenza viruses for Europe and North America showed significant differences.
  This supports the fact of two geographically distinct gene pools of influenza
  viruses in birds connected with their distinct flyways of each hemisphere. The
  high frequency of isolation of H2 influenza viruses is of considerable interest
  to those interested in.
 the recycling of this subtype in humans. Similarly
  the frequent isolation of H7N7 influenza viruses raises concern about
  reservoirs of potentially pathogenic influenze virus for domestic poultry. Out
  results confirm the existence of a vast reservoir of influenze A viruses in
  European aquatic birds, which possesses sufficient diversity to account for
  strains that infect lower animals and humans.

AB: To study the epidemiology of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections
  during the year, the incidences of primary infections and reinfections were
  monitored by titrating antibodies to bovine RSV (BRSV) in cattle above 2 months
  of age in 6 dairy herds in the Netherlands. From August 1990 until September
  1991, 884 cattle were sampled at one-month intervals. A total of 155 cattle,
  most under two years of age, had a primary antibody response. Antibody rises
  were found in 259 cattle of all ages. The highest incidences of BRSV infections
  were found in one period either in autumn or winter. In other seasons, primary
  infections were rare, whereas reinfections were not uncommon. In 5 out of the 6
  herds, two seronegative sentinel calves were introduced at the end of the
  winter and none developed specific antibodies before the next winter. The
  observations strongly suggest that, in spite of regular reinfections, BRSV
  circulates during spring or summer at a very low level or not at all.
  Persistent BRSV infection in a number of cows might be a means for the virus to
  survive during summer, but a steady rate of reinfection of seropositive cows
  throughout the year at a low level might also maintain a reservoir of
  infectious virus. This study adds to the knowledge of frequency and timings of
  primary infections and reinfections of BRSV and it might contribute to the
  study of these issues of human RSV.

AB: A regional prospective study of the epidemiology of bluetongue virus (BTV)
  serotypes covering 11 countries in Central America and the Caribbean took place
  between 1987 and 1992. Active surveillance revealed BTV infection to be endemic
  in the absence of confirmed indigenous cases of bluetongue. During the 6-year
  span of the study, over 300 BTV isolations were obtained from cattle and sheep.
  Results of the earlier years of the study were summarized, and surveillance
  activities in the concluding months of the study from November 1990 to February
  1992 were evaluated. Forty-five BTV isolations were made during this time, 44
  from sentinel cattle and 1 from a ram with clinical signs compatible with
  contagious ecthyma. Virus isolation from potential vectors also was attempted,
  yielding a further 9 BTV isolates from parous Culicoides insignis and C
  pusillus, 2 BTV isolates from blood-engorged C filarifer, and 1 epizootic
  hemorrhagic disease virus type-2 isolate from parous C pusillus. Our extensive
  network of sentinel herds in the region detected BTV-1 as the predominant
  serotype in Central America in 1991, after an apparent absence of 1 year in the
  sentinel animals. Other serotypes in Central America at that time included BTV
  -3 and BTV-6. In Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, BTV-4 became the
  predominant serotype, without detection of BTV-8 and BTV-17, which were common
  in recent years of the study. The serotypes found in the Caribbean Basin
  continued to have marked differences from those in North America. The
  importance of viewing bluetongue as an infection, the distribution of which is
  determined principally by ecologic factors, is emphasized.

AB: Twenty sheep were divided into groups and inoculated by various routes with
  recombinant raccoon   poxvirus expressing the CVS rabies virus glycoprotein
  (rRCNV-G) or with raccoon poxvirus (RCNV).  The apparent innocuous pathologic
  responses to each virus coupled with development of high levels   of rabies
  virus neutralizing antibodies in animals vaccinated with RRCNV-G intradermally
  or   intramuscularly suggested that the recombinant is effective and that RCNV
  would be a suitable   substrate for further development of sheep vaccines. 
  Poor antibody response to RRCNV-G given   orally implied that it would be
  relatively harmless if inadvertently ingested by sheep.  Virus   transmission
  between vaccinated and sentinel sheep was not observed or detected
  serologically.

AB: To determine the effectiveness of white-tailed deer as sentinel animals in
  serologic surveillance   programs for Borrelia burgdorferi, we performed enzyme
  -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and   Western immunoblotting analyses on
  467 deer serum samples. The seropositivity rate in the ELISA   was 5% for the
  150 samples collected at the three sites in which the tick Ixodes scapularis
  was   absent. The three sites with established I. scapularis populations had a
  seropositivity rate of  80% for 317 samples. Results were similar for two
  closely situated sites, one with an established   I. scapularis population and
  one without; these sites were only 15 km apart. Rates of   seropositivity were
  significantly higher in yearling and adult deer than in fawns. The mean 
  numbers of bands seen on Western immunoblots were 3.0 for samples negative in
  the ELISA and 13.8   for samples positive in the ELISA; all of these samples
  were collected from sites in which I.   scapularis was established. At sites in
  which I. scapularis was absent, the mean numbers of bands   seen were 1.6 for
  samples negative in the ELISA and 8.2 for samples positive in the ELISA. There 
   were 14 different B. burgdorferi antigens that reacted with more than 50% of
  the ELISA-positive   samples from areas with I. scapularis. A 19.5-kDa antigen
  reacted with 94% of the ELISA-positive  samples. Reactivity against OspA and
  OspB was weak and infrequent (2%). Serologic analysis of  white-tailed deer
  sera appears to be an accurate and sensitive surveillance method for
  determining.
 whether B. burgdorferi is present in specific geographic
  locations.

AB: Influence of attractant, season, habitat, temperature, and physiological
  state of the screwworm, Cochliomyia hominivorax (Coquerel), on daily activity
  and oviposition were examined during a 122 d study in a tropical dry forest in
  Costa Rica. Flies were marked and released. Numbers of flies visiting baits
  increased during the wet season and decreased during the dry season; 3 times
  more flies were observed at baits during the wet season than were observed
  during the dry season. An average of 33 females and 3 males was observed per
  day during the study. More flies (3.6 times) were attracted to liver than to
  sentinel sheep; many flies originally marked at liver failed to return and few
  of them oviposited on sentinel sheep. Females marked at sheep were recaptured
  more times and remained in the study area longer. More females marked at sheep
  sites were recaptured (51.4-54.1%) than those marked at liver sites (32.3
  -44.7). More than 6 times as many flies were observed at forest than at pasture
  sites. The physiological state of the female influenced daily activity. High
  temperatures during midday (> 31 degrees C) depressed activity and decreased
  the number of foraging hours available for flies during the dry season.
  Decreasing host resources and number of hours available for foraging may be
  factors that limit screwworm populations in the dry season.

AB: Culicoides variipennis (Coquillett), the only proven vector of bluetongue
  virus (BLU) in the western hemisphere, was evaluated as a vector of bluetongue
  virus serotype 2 (BLU 2). This serotype was isolated from sentinel cattle in
  south Florida at a site devoid of C. variipennis. Culicoides variipennis
  readily fed on a mixture of defibrinated blow and BLU 2 through chicken skin
  membrane. An infection rate of 46.2% was obtained. A growth curve of virus
  titers recovered from orally infected flies showed a linear relationship
  between the virus titers and the period of extrinsic incubation. Culicoides
  variipennis also became infected when inoculated intrathoracically with BLU 2.
  Peak titers were higher and more rapidly attained in inoculated flies when
  compared with orally infected flies. Infected C. variipennis also transmitted
  BLU 2 to sheep via bite. These results demonstrate that C. variipennis is a
  potential biological vector of BLU 2 in the laboratory. The implication of this
  on the epidemiology of BLU 2 in the United States is that BLU 2 should have
  become more widespread in ruminants in the United States. The fact that this
  has not occurred during the past 10 yr is discussed.

AB: Releases of Muscidifurax raptor (Girault & Sanders) were integrated with
  weekly removal of calf bedding and infrequent use of pyrethrin space sprays for
  management of house flies, Musca domestica L., on seven dairy farms in New York
  and Maryland; six other farms were used as controls. Baited traps were used for
  supplemental outdoor fly control on release farms in Maryland. Parasitoid
  releases were made by weekly placement of either 25,000 (in New York) or 20,000
  (in Maryland) parasitized house fly pupae in screen bags on each farm,
  resulting in weekly release rates of 12,000 and 9,600 female parasitoids per
  farm per week, respectively. Overall season-long fly pupal mortality (as
  measured by sentinel flypupae) was 65 and 38% on release farms in New York and
  Maryland, respectively, compared with 30 and 26% on control farms. Overall
  parasitism was 36 and 18% on release farms in New York and Maryland,
  respectively, compared with 5 and 3% on control farms. Fly populations on
  control farms in both states were approximately twice as large as on release
  farms based on spot card and resting fly counts inside the barns. Producers on
  control farms in New York made an average of 14.7 insecticide applications
  (space sprays, baits, and residual premise treatments) for house fly control
  compared with 2.7 insecticide applications (pyrethrin space sprays) on release
  farms.

AB: Dormant bud tissue from two or more trees representing 18 red maple (Acer
  rubrum L.) cultivars was subjected to isozyme analyses using starch-gel
  electrophoresis. Polymorphic enzymes resolved were alcohol dehydrogenase,
  peroxidase, phosphoglucose isomerase, glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase,
  leucine aminopeptidase, acid phosphatase, and malic dehydrogenase. An enzyme
  pattern or combination of patterns was useful in identifying individual
  cultivars, these included: 'Autumn Blaze', 'Autumn Flame', 'Bowhall',
  'Celebration', 'Columnare', 'Curtis', 'Doric', 'Firedance', 'Gerling', 'V.J.
  Drake', 'Morgan', 'Northwood', 'Scarlet Sentinel', 'Schlesingeri', and
  'Tilford'. 'Armstrong', 'October Glory', and 'Red Sunset' could not be
  distinguished from each other on the basis of enzymes examined in this study.

AB: Field and laboratory experiments were conducted during an epizootic of
  Coelomomyces punctatus (Chytridiomycetes: Blastocladiales) in a population of
  the mosquito Anopheles quadrimaculatus in a North Carolina farm pond to examine
  the interactions of several potential copepod hosts with the mosquito and
  fungus. The diel vertical migratory behavior of the copepod species
  Acanthocyclops robustus, Eucyclops serrulatus, Macrocyclops albidus, and
  Mesocyclops edax were monitored in relation to infection rates in sentinel
  mosquito larvae. Mosquito infection occurred primarily around dusk, the same
  period during which A. robustus and E. serrulatus were most abundant near the
  surface of the pond. However, exposure of A. robustus, E. serrulatus, M.
  albidus, M. edax, Microcyclops varicans, and Paracyclops poppei to fungal
  meiospores in the laboratory showed that only A. robustus and M. edax were
  competent intermediate hosts for C. punctatus. Laboratory studies of the diel
  periodicity of gametangial dehiscence in A. robustus and M. edax infected with
  C. punctatus revealed that gamete release and zygote formation also occurred
  around dusk. The combined results of the laboratory and field studies on
  copepod abundance, susceptibility to infection, and periodicity of gametangial
  dehiscence suggest that A. robustus was the principal intermediate host for C.
  punctatus during the epizootic, though it is probable that M. edax also
  contributed importantly to the overall rate of laval infection.

AB: Biotic and abiotic parameters associated with an epizootic of the fungus
  Coelomomyces punctatus in larval populations of the mosquito Anopheles
  quadrimaculatus were investigated for three mosquito breeding seasons (1986
  -1988) in two adjacent farm ponds in North Carolina. In the first pond, the
  prevalence of infected larvae averaged 42% (range 0-85%) for collections made
  weekly from May 1 to November 20, 1986, but larvae did not occur in this pond
  in 1987. Infection rates in the adjacent pond, sampled during the mosquito
  breeding seasons of 1987 and 1988, declined from 10.9% (range 0-27.5%) in 1987
  to 2.5% (range 0-14.2%) in 1988. Correlation analyses between the number of
  female cope-pods and fungal infection rates in sentinel mosquitoes were
  significant (P < 0.01) for Acanthocyclops robustus but insignificant for eight
  other species. Infections obtained in sentinel larvae placed in the ponds for 3
  hr intervals indicated that C. punctatus infected larvae around sundown.
  Infection rates for field-collected larvae increased with the stage of larval
  development. However, experiments with sentinel larvae showed that early
  instars were more susceptible to infection than later instars, suggesting that
  the higher infection rates in late instars resulted from individual larvae
  being infected by two or more zygotes during larval development. Standard
  multiple regression analyses, used to determine the relationship between
  seasonal infection rates and water chemistry, weather variables, and the
  abundance of early and late instar larvae, showed that the abundance of late
  instars was the only independent variable common to linear models. The models
  only accounted for 20 and 9% of the variation in larval infection rates for
  1987 and 1988, respectively. These results indicate that of the parameters
  examined, the seasonal abundance of the copepod, A. robustus, was the most
  important factor (or variable) correlated with the prevalence of mosquito
  infection.

AB: We constructed a recombinant BHV-1 in which the glycoprotein gIII gene was
  replaced by the Escherichia coli lacZ gene. The resultant virus mimics the
  simple gIII deletion mutant in its growth characteristics in cell culture,
  however, it expresses beta-galactosidase in virus-infected cells. Further
  characterization of its virulence and the immune responses elicited by it was
  conducted in cattle. The mutant virus retained the ability to establish an
  infection when administered intranasally. Infected animals were also capable of
  transmitting virus to sentinel penmates. However, the mutant virus showed a
  reduced replication efficiency in the respiratory tract of cattle, as
  manifested by significantly lower virus shedding and a shorter duration of
  shedding when compared to wild-type (wt) BHV-1 infections. The mutant virus
  induced an efficient anti-BHV-1 antibody response and convalescent cattle were
  fully protected from subsequent wt virus challenge. In addition, cattle
  infected with the lacZ-expressing virus developed antibodies to beta
  -galactosidase. Our results demonstrate that the presence of gIII is not a
  prerequisite for BHV-1 infection; however, gIII does play an important role in
  maintaining virus replication efficacy in its natural host. With respect to
  developing BHV-1 as a vaccine vector, our results indicate that deletion of the
  gIII gene, which partially attenuates the virus and serves as a vaccine virus
  marker, does not compromise immunogenicity to BHV-1. Most importantly, this
  vector is effective in delivering foreign antigens to mucosal surfaces of the
  respiratory tract.

AB: Influenza was detected in a flock of broiler breeders during routine

  may, have been affected in hens on one story of a two-story breeder house.
  Intensive measures were taken to avoid transmission to other farms. Two months
  after the flock was found to be serologically positive, sentinel hens were
  placed in the flock, and they became serologically positive 1 month later. In
  spite of this evidence for virus being present in the flock, no detectable
  transmission to any other farm occurred.

AB: Patterns of hyperparasitism of cocoons of Cotesia melanoscela in southern
  Ontario were studied by periodic sampling of naturally occurring cocoons found
  under burlap bands and by deploying laboratory-produced sentinel cocoons on
  bark disks. At least six species of hyperparasitoids were recovered. The most
  common species of hyperparasitoids showed definite associations with sampling
  method and with red or white oak trees. Hyperparasitism of C. melanoscela began
  in early June and persisted throughout the summer. Peak activity of
  hyperparasitoids was in late June and early July and was coincident with the
  maximum number of available natural C. melanoscela cocoons in diapause. The
  probability of C. melanoscela survival during any single sampling interval
  declined steadily over the sampling period (14 June-3 August 1989). During this
  sampling period, 95.9% of the available C. melanoscela cocoons were killed by
  hyperparasitoids. This estimate of hyperparasitism is a minimum rate for
  Ontario; cocoons not attacked by the end of our sampling period were in
  diapause and thus were vulnerable to hyperparasitism for up to 10 mo after
  sampling ended.

AB: Foodborne diseases, i.e. illnesses due to contaminated food, are one of the
  most widespread problems of the contemporary world. They are toxic or
  infectious by nature and are caused by agents which enter the body through the
  ingestion of contaminated food or water. These agents can be chemical like
  pesticide residues and toxic metals or biological like pathogenic
  microorganisms. Foods contaminated by biological agents are, however, the major
  cause of foodborne disease. Data recorded in different countries show that the
  incidence of some of these diseases has increased dramatically over the past
  few years, but because of under-reporting the data are of limited value and
  cannot be compared between countries. In most countries, individual cases of
  illness are usually not reported. A sentinel surveillance system, started as a
  pilot study in the Netherlands, was shown to be feasible for the registration
  of some foodborne infections. Based on this study, it can be estimated that
  each year Salmonella and Campylobacter cause respectively about 12000 and 25000
  cases of acute enteritis per million. Case-control studies clearly implicate
  poultry products as an important source of acute enteritis. New developments in
  food production and changing trends in food consumption lead to the emergence
  of new hazards. Additionally, because the population is aging and there has
  been an increase in the number of individuals with underlying diseases, the
  state of public health is deteriorating. Campylobacter, Salmonella enteritidis
  and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli are examples of microorganisms that have
  the opportunity to increase as a consequence of intensive husbandry. Listeria
  monocytogenes is an example of an organism that causes disease in
  immunosuppressed individuals.

AB: St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus has become established in the Los Angeles
  Basin of California, where it most likely is maintained by horizontal
  transmission among Culex tarsalis Coquillett and passerine birds in park
  -riparian habitat. Viral transmission also was detected at low levels in
  residential habitat by the infrequent seroconversion of sentinel chickens. SLE
  virus activity was documented in all months except March and April. Cx.
  tarsalis was incriminated as the primary vector, based on elevated field
  infection rates (0.17 infected females per 1,000 tested), population abundance
  concomitant in time and space with increased SLE virus activity, vector
  competence, and vectorial capacity. Culex stigmatosoma Dyar also may be
  important in the horizontal maintenance of SLE virus because this species was
  an efficient laboratory vector, fed frequently on passeriform birds, and had
  field infection rates (0.15 females per 1,000) comparable with Cx. tarsalis.
  However, difficulty in trapping adult females precluded the assessment of Cx.
  stigmatosoma because abundance may have been underestimated and comparatively
  few females were tested for virus. Although Cx. quinquefasciatus Say was the
  most abundant species in residential habitats (> 85% of total catch at CO2
  traps) where it occasionally fed on humans (0.6% of total tested), this species
  was considered to be of secondary importance because field infection rates were
  low (0.03 females per 1,000) and few females became infected and transmitted
  SLE virus in laboratory vector competence experiments. Although Culex
  erythrothorax Dyar fed on humans in marsh habitat (5% of total tested), this
  species infrequently fed on birds (12%) and was refractory to SLE virus
  infection in vector competence experiments; therefore, it was not considered a
  vector of SLE virus. Future SLE virus surveillance and mosquito control
  programs should be directed toward Cx. tarsalis populations.

AB: Mosquito abundance and western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE) and St. Louis
  encephalitis (SLE) virus activity were monitored in five valleys in
  southeastern California from June 1986 through April 1990 to study virus
  overwintering and possible dissemination from south to north along
  geographically defined corridors. Culex tarsalis Coquillett predominated in CO2
  trap collections and was the only species repeatedly infected with WEE and SLE
  viruses. Abundance peaked during April-May and August-October. WEE virus
  infections in Cx. tarsalis generally were detected after the spring peak and
  were followed approximately 1 mo later by seroconversions in sentinel chickens.
  SLE virus infections occurred later in the summer but before the fall peak in
  Cz. tarsalis abundance. Peak Cx. tarsalis abundance occurred when monthly
  temperatures averaged 25 degrees C, whereas virus infections generally were
  detected most frequently when temperatures exceeded 29 degrees C. Although the
  spring increase in Cx. tarsalis abundance occurred earlier in southern valleys,
  the onset of virus activity was variable among valleys and did not follow a
  south to north progression.

AB: Temporal and spatial patterns of St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus
  transmission were compared at permanent study areas in the southern San Joaquin
  Valley during years with low (1988 and 1990) and elevated (1989) viral
  activity. During 1989 and 1990, virus appeared first at sentinel chicken flocks
  exhibiting low to moderate seroconversion rates at the end of the previous
  season. This finding, and the early season seroconversion of sentinel chickens
  at a marsh habitat on 5 March and 2 April 1990, circumstantially indicated that
  SLE virus may have overwintered in the valley during the winters of 1988-1989
  and 1989-1990. The mechanism of overwintering was not elucidated further,
  because virus could not be isolated from overwintering adult mosquitoes or from
  immatures collected during the spring. An outbreak of 26 confirmed SLE cases
  occurred in 1989 during a drought year (rainfall 50% of normal) and followed a
  spring with elevated temperatures (1.7-3.4 degrees C above normal) and Culex
  tarsalis Coquillett abundance. Cx. tarsalis was the primary vector, being most
  abundant during the virus amplification period in early summer and most
  frequently infected (70 SLE virus positive pools/329 tested). SLE virus also
  was detected in Culex quinquefasciatus Say (14/65) and Cx. stigmatosoma Dyar
  (1/4); however, both species were distributed focally and increased in
  abundance only after widespread seroconversions had occurred in sentinel
  chickens. Increased virus activity during 1989 was not accompanied by marked
  changes in vector susceptibility or in SLE virus infectivity for mosquitoes.
  Decreased virus activity in the Bakersfield area during 1990 could not be
  attributed to immunity in passeriform birds, because a small seroprevalence
  survey indicated that few adult birds had antibodies to SLE virus.

AB: An unexpected outbreak of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in Bangkok in 1985 led
  us to investigate the vector ecology of urban JE from January 1986 to June 1987
  at three suburban sites that displayed a wide range of factors imputed to
  influence JE transmission. Culex tritaeniorhynchus Giles and Cx. gelidus
  Theobald, suspected vectors, comprised 71-96% of all mosquitoes collected by
  CO2-baited CDC traps at the three sites. Mean of mosquito abundance per two
  trap-nights per month ranged from 28 to 5,728 mosquitoes at the sites of lowest
  and highest abundance, respectively. Cx. tritaeniorhynchus yielded more JE
  isolates (n = 16) than Cx. gelidus (n = 7), but the minimum infection rates of
  the two species (number of JE isolates per 1,000 mosquitoes tested; MIR, 0.17
  and 0.47, respectively) were comparable and covaried with vector abundance.
  Moreover, the proportion of sentinel pigs that had JE antibodies generally
  increased proportionately with vector abundance at the sites. Vector abundance
  was high in monsoon (May-October), moderate in transition (March-April and
  November-December), and low in dry (January-February) seasons. Mosquitoes
  collected in monsoon seasons yielded 96% of the JE isolates, whereas 4 and 0%
  of the isolates were obtained from transition and dry season collections,
  respectively. More pigs seroconverted in monsoon and transition seasons than in
  dry seasons. Indices of JE transmission activity (vector abundance, pig
  seroconversions, and MIRs increased proportionately with rainfall. Despite
  higher indices at the site of greatest vector abundance than elsewhere, the
  risk of human infection appeared greatest at the site with moderate vector
  abundance because of its greater human population density.

AB: The parasitic wasp Muscidifurax zaraptor Kogan & Legner was mass reared in
  the field to control house flies, Musca domestica L., on two Nebraska beef
  cattle confinements. About 50,000 freeze-killed house fly pupae were exposed to
  a single release of M. zaraptor in the field. Placement of six additional
  cohorts of 50,000 freeze-killed pupae at the release sites at 2-wk intervals
  resulted in a mean parasite emergence of 56.4% over the study period. Mean fly
  mortality of 37.3 and 25.9% occurred in sentinel pupae placed around the
  perimeter of two release sites, compared with 3.9% for two control sites. We
  demonstrated a negative correlation between host reduction in sentinel cohorts
  and distances the cohorts were placed from parasite release sites. However,
  data indicated that other environmental factors also influenced the success of
  M. zaraptor in locating sentinel hosts. Correlation between mortality in
  sentinel pupae and numbers of parasites released was not evident. Temperatures
  above approximately 28 degrees C appeared to reduce the effectiveness of M.
  zaraptor.

AB: Studies to determine the persistence of released, sterile screwworms,
  cochliomyia hominivorax (Coquerel), were conducted in Belize, Central America,
  in 1987-1988. A total of nine releases were made, each consisting of 4,000
  females marked with a fluorescent dust. Previous similar studies with baited
  fly traps indicated that flies died or dispersed from the release site within 3
  -4 d. For this study, flies were recaptured at sentinel animals. Recapture
  rates varied greatly between releases, a result that was not correlated with
  any weather parameter. The pattern of recapture indicated a sharp drop in the
  released population after 9-10 d, with a few flies persisting in the release
  area for up to 3 wk. The results suggest that survival of released sterile
  flies is comparable with estimated survival rate and life span of wild, native
  flies.

AB: Sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV) was detected in athymic rats subcutaneously
  implanted with human tumor cell lines. Clinical signs included sneezing,
  dyspnea, weight loss and death. Necropsy revealed both upper and lower
  respiratory tract disease from which Staphylococcus aureus. Pasteurella
  pneumotropica and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were recovered. Histopathological
  changes consisted of suppurative rhinitis and bronchopneumonia. Lesions
  characteristic of SDAV infection were found in lacrimal and salivary glands,
  and viral antigens were detected in the salivary glands and respiratory tract
  by immunohistochemistry. Submaxillary salivary gland, Harderian gland and lung
  homogenates from affected athymic rats were inoculated intranasally into
  euthymic rats as a rat antibody production test. All euthymic rats
  seroconverted to SDAV. Seroconversion to SDAV was demonstrated in consecutive
  pairs of sentinel euthymic rats housed for 6 months with infected athymic rats.
  Inoculation of supernatants of the original tumor cell lines into euthymic rats
  did not result in seroconversion. The source of the virus was not determined.
  In this study, spontaneously acquired SDAV infection persisted for at least 6
  months in athymic rats.

AB: The effect of the fungus, Entomophaga maimaiga, on gypsy moth populations
  was investigated by assessing the prevalence of disease in caterpillars
  collected from forest plots and in laboratory-reared, sentinel caterpillars
  exposed in wire cages in the same plots. The importance of moisture was
  evaluated by spraying water on portions of two sites four times a day. Large
  amounts of rainfall in May appeared to be critical for development of the
  fungus. Under favorable conditions, infection rates averaged 5% or less in May,
  but reached 40% or more in June. Infective conidia were produced in May, while
  resting spores became increasingly common within dead cadavers in June. The
  prevalence of E. maimaiga was slightly higher in forest-collected larvae from
  sprinkled portions of the sites, and was significantly higher in caged larvae
  in the irrigated areas. Infection rates also varied between plots, and were
  correlated with gypsy moth density and tree composition. Using a degree-day
  model, estimates of daily recruitment and death of fungus-infected caterpillars
  were obtained. Recruitment in May was not related to precipitation, possibly
  because of abundant rainfall, but in June recruitment was correlated with the
  sporadic rainfall that occurred then. Data on recruitment and death were used
  to construct survival curves for larvae. Only a few to over half the larvae
  survived the fungus epizootic in different plots.

AB: Egg masses from wild populations of the screwworm, Cochliomyia hominivorax
  (Coquerel), were obtained by collecting females from rotted liver, holding them
  for 3 d until egg maturation and then placing them on heated ground beef for
  oviposition. Nearly 50% of the females oviposited. Fertility of egg masses was
  66 and 95% at the two collection sites. Decreased fertility was associated with
  collections of virgin females. Average weight +/- SD of the egg masses was 13.7
  +/- 1.40 mg; the number of eggs per mass averaged 343. This method of obtaining
  egg masses f rom wild screwworm females is a cost-effective, sensitive
  alternative to the use of sentinel animals in the field. The use of rotted
  liver costs less, takes less time, and takes less equipment than the
  traditional sentinel animal technique.

AB: In a mark-release-recapture study, sheep wounds and rotted liver were used
  as attractants to study movements of the screwworm fly, Cochliomyia hominivorax
  (Coquerel), in a Costa Rican tropical wet forest in the wet season. When sites
  were monitored for < 1 h, liver attracted between 3 and 12.2 times more flies
  of both sexes than did wounds, but proportionately fewer gravid and parous
  females. Only 24.6% of females marked at liver sites were recaptured; seldom
  (3.1%) did they visit sheep wounds. Females originally marked at sheep wounds
  remained at the study site longer, visited both sheep and liver sites, and >
  50% were recaptured. Some females were observed for 16 d and one laid four
  clutches of eggs. Only 8% of the marked males were recaptured and none was
  recaptured < 2 d later. Only a small proportion of the adult screwworms at a
  locality visited wounds on sentinel sheep; the majority of the adults were
  transient.

AB: We developed an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for the detection of immunoglobulin
  M (IgM) and IgG subclass antibodies directed against eastern equine
  encephalomyelitis (EEE) virus in chickens. The assays were compared with the
  serum plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) and the hemagglutination
  inhibition (HI) test for ability to detect antibodies against EEE virus in
  laboratory-infected birds. No cross-reactivity was detected in serum from
  chickens inoculated with St. Louis encephalitis or Highlands J virus. The
  interval after infection when EEE virus-specific antibodies were first detected
  by IgM and IgG EIAs was found to be similar to that determined by the PRNT and
  HI tests: 2 to 4 days. The IgG EIA, PRNT, and HI test detected antibodies to
  EEE virus for at least 27 to 30 days after inoculation. In contrast, serum from
  five of seven chickens did not contain detectable IgM 30 days after infection.
  Similarly, in all three naturally infected sentinel chickens from Maryland, IgM
  class antibody was undetectable I to 5 weeks after IgM was initially detected.
  EIAs provide simple and rapid alternatives to traditional tests for monitoring
  EEE virus infections in sentinel chicken flocks. Moreover, the IgM EIA provides
  a means to separate recently infected chickens from those infected -1 month
  earlier.

AB: Field trials were conducted to determine the best attractant for adults of
  the screwworm, Cochliomyia hominivorax (Coquerel), in Costa Rica. The five
  attractants were wounded sentinel sheep, decayed fruit, rotted beef liver,
  rotted fish, and medium used to rear larvae of this blow fly. Significantly
  more adults came to rotted liver than any other attractant. No adults were
  captured in traps baited with rotted fruit. Significantly more males came to
  beef liver than were captured at other baits; males were rarely encountered at
  wounds. Ovarian development of females obtained with different attractants
  indicated that proportionally more gravid females visited wounded animals than
  were caught in traps with proteinaceous baits. Most females had mated by egg
  stage five and mating and parity in the populations that visited different
  attractants were similar. Significantly more females (81%) marked initially at
  wounds returned to wounds than visited traps baited with liver or fish.

AB: Seasonal transmission of Fasciola hepatica was observed in sentinel sheep
  and the dynamics of the snail intermediate host, Lymnaea truncatula, was
  followed over a 3-year study period in the Middle-Atlas mountains in Morocco.
  High fluke burdens were recorded in both lambs and ewes in the fall and winter,
  suggesting that transmission occurred in late spring. Fluke burdens ranged from
  one to 302 in ewes and from one to 345 in lambs. Infections with 200 or more
  flukes were always fatal. A unique feature of this study was the annual
  cyclical fluctuation of the fluke burdens. Burdens reached maximum levels
  during the winter and then declined to low numbers by late spring and summer.
  This suggested self-regulation which may be dependent on breed resistance or
  may be related to forage factors, including lack of forage (nutritional
  stress). Snail populations were cyclical and correlated with fluke transmission
  as observed in the sentinel sheep. The weather was observed to affect the snail
  populations which in turn limited fluke transmission.

AB: Experiments were conducted to determine (a) whether BALB/c mice housed on
  soiled bedding can be used as sentinels for the detection of Sendai virus and
  MHV from infected mice housed in microisolators, and (b) whether the
  microisolator caging system protects mice against Sendai virus and MHV
  infections. Sentinel mice were housed in microisolator cages, exposed
  continuously to soiled bedding and bled at 21 and 42 days for serology. All
  sentinel mice were seropositive for MHV by 42 days; however, sentinel mice
  exposed to soiled bedding were seronegative for Sendai virus at 21 and 42 days.
  These results suggest that sentinels housed on soiled bedding may not detect
  all infectious murine viruses. This study also showed that the microisolator
  caging system provided an effective barrier against MHV infection at the cage
  level and suggests that the microisolators should protect mice against other
  infectious agents.

AB: A survey of indigenous parasitoids attacking Musca domestica L. and Stomoxys
  calcitrans (L.) pupae was conducted for 2 yr at eight dairies by exposing
  weekly samples of laboratory-reared fly pupae (sentinel bags). Mean relative
  abundance of each species was 59% Muscidifurax raptor Girault and Sanders, 14%
  Urolepis rufipes (Ashmead), 11% Phygadeuon fumator Gravenhorst, 10% Spalangia
  cameroni Perkins, 3% Spalangia nigroaenea Curtis, and 2% Trichomalopsis dubius
  (Ashmead). Rare species included Pachycrepoideus vindemmiae (Rondani), Nasonia
  vitripennis (Walker), Dibrachys cavus (Walker), Spalangia nigra Latreille, and
  Macroneura vesicularis (Retzius). Total parasitism was phenologically
  synchronized with the house fly population occurring between 17 May and 27
  October, but it peaked 1-2 mo after the fly population peaked. M. raptor, U.
  rufipes, and P. fumator were common in June. A decrease in parasitism by M.
  raptor and U. rufipes during late July may represent a gap between the first
  two generations. Paired samples of sentinel house fly and stable fly pupae
  indicated no difference in parasitism by M. raptor or by all species combined.
  However, U. rufipes parasitized more house fly pupae, and P. fumator
  parasitized more stable fly pupae.

AB: Cool-season cover crops were used in efforts to enhance densities of
  entomophagous insects on relay-intercropped spring plantings of cantaloupe
  (Cucumis melo L. var. reticulatus Seringe). Eight cover-cropping regimes,
  including a weedy fallow control, were tested in a replicated trial. Cover crop
  significantly affected densities of the predominant predator, a bigeyed bug,
  Geocoris punctipes (Say), amid cover crops, on or near cantaloupe plants, and
  on or near sentinel egg masses of fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E.
  Smith) pinned to cantaloupe leaves. No significant difference was found for
  proportions of egg masses occupied or damaged by predators. For all indices of
  predator abundance and efficiency, absolute responses were highest for the
  plots of subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L., 'Mt. Barker'). Numbers
  of G. punctipes per sentinel egg mass were significantly greater for the
  subterranean clover regime than for rye, crimson clover, and a polyculture of
  six cover crops, but were not significantly greater than for 'Vantage' vetch or
  the weedy fallow control plots. Rye showed particularly low densities of G.
  punctipes. Cover crops had no apparent effect on densities of aphids or
  whiteflies (Homoptera: Aphididae, Aleyrodidae) on cantaloupe leaves.

AB: Wistar rats [CR1:(WI)BR] were inoculated intranasally with approximately
  10(3) median mouse lethal infective doses of sialodacryoadenitis (SDA) virus.
  Animals were subsequently selected at random, removed to a separate isolation
  room, and reinfected with SDA virus at 3, 6, 9, 12 or 15 months. Pre- and
  postinoculation serum samples were collected from all animals during the course
  of the study and evaluated for antibody titers to SDA virus. All experimental,
  control and sentinel animals, following inoculation with SDA virus, were
  necropsied and examined for lesions consistent with SDA. Salivary gland lesions
  were minimal to absent in rats reinfected with SDA virus for up to 12 to 15
  months after the initial exposure and minimal to moderate in the respiratory
  tract at 12 or 15 months. SDA-associated lesions were extensive in age matched
  control animals examined at each time period of reinfection with SDA virus.
  Thus, prior exposure to SDA virus did protect against the development of
  typical salivary gland lesions for up to 15 months. Recovered animals were
  evaluated for their ability to transmit the virus following reinfection. Rats
  reinfected at 6 or 9 months were infectious to their naive cage mates. The
  results indicate that reinfection with homologous rat coronavirus can occur as
  early as 6 months after the initial infection, and such rats can transmit the
  infection to contact controls.

AB: The seasonal population trends of cattle nematodes in tracer calves are
  described from 1981 to 1987. Successive worm-free calves were grazed with
  growing beef cattle for 20-30 days at 6 week intervals and then slaughtered for
  nematode counts 2 weeks after their removal from pasture. Ostertagia, Cooperia,
  Trichostrongylus and Haemonchus were the main genera recovered. O. ostertagi
  was the most often found and acquisition of inhibition-prone larvae began in
  late winter and reached a peak in spring, while maximum larval availability was
  in autumn. The seasonal inhibition and larval availability pattern for T. axei
  was similar to that of Ostertagia. Cooperia showed greatest inhibition during
  winter with maximum larval availability in autumn and spring. Haemonchus was
  more prevalent during summer to early autumn and no inhibition was observed. It
  was concluded that infective larval availability for tracer calves was highest
  during autumn, and most reduced in summer. All predominant species were able to
  survive over summer on pasture.

AB: Serologic evidence indicated that an episode of congenital abnormalities in
  sheep was caused by Cache Valley virus (CVV), a bunyavirus indigenous to the
  United States. To determine the teratogenic potential of CVV in sheep, fetuses
  were infected in utero between 27 and 54 days of gestation with an isolate (CK
  -102) obtained in 1987 from a sentinel sheep in San Angelo, Texas. The dams of
  these fetuses were euthanatized between 28 and 75 days after inoculation, and
  the fetuses were examined for malformations. Twenty-eight of 34 fetuses had
  congenital abnormalities, including arthrogryposis, hydranencephaly,
  mummification, reabsorption, and oligohydroamnion. Virus was isolated from the
  allantoic fluid of 11 of 17 fetuses euthanatized at less than 70 days of
  gestation. The virus-positive fetuses, which were all negative for CVV
  -neutralizing antibody, had lesions ranging from none to severe arthrogryposis
  and hydranencephaly. Virus was not recovered from the allantoic fluid of
  fetuses after 76 days' gestation when CVV-specific antibody could be detected
  in 5 of 8 fetuses examined. The 2 fetuses infected on days 50 and 54 of
  gestation appeared normal and 1 had antibody to CVV.

AB: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were established to detect Breda virus
  antigen in feces and homologous antibodies of the IgG1, IgM, and IgA isotypes
  in serum. With the aid of solid-phase immune-electron microscopy, torovirions
  in fecal material were observed. The course of natural infection was studied in
  10 sentinel calves that had been obtained from different farms, and housed
  together at 1 week of age. They were separated from other cattle until the age
  of 10 months. Up to the age of 4 months, all calves regularly excreted Breda
  virus in the feces. Irrespective of the existence of IgG1 isotype maternal
  antibodies, all calves had early IgM responses in serum, but lack of IgA
  seroconversion. In 7 calves, antibody titer decreased below detection, whereas
  3 calves had an isotype switch, resulting in persistent IgG1 titer. After
  introduction into the dairy herd at 10 months of age, all calves had diarrhea,
  and shedding of Breda virus was observed in 8 of them. Seroconversion for all
  antibody isotypes was observed, indicating lack of mucosal memory. In contrast,
  coronavirus infection in the presence of maternal antibodies led to isotype
  switch in all calves but one, and a memory response was observed after
  introduction into the dairy herd.

AB: Reproductive capacity and activity patterns of native screwworm (Cochliomyia
  hominivorax (Coquerel)) males were evaluated by release and recapture of
  sterile females in central Belize. On six occasions 4,000 virgin, 1-d-old
  sterile females were released at a central location. A total of 382 sterile
  females and 66 native females were recaptured on sentinel sheep at four
  location. Ratios of virgin to mated recaptured females were used to calculate
  an estimated number of matings per release. During the 65-d period of the test,
  numbers of recaptured females and mating percentages increased, then decreased
  for the last release. Location of sentinel animals, day after release, and
  individual releases were significant factors explaining capture rates for mated
  and nonmated release females and captures of native females. Mating capacity
  for the native population of screwworm males over the 10-d recapture period was
  estimated to range from 70 to 1,735 matings for the dispersal area of these
  females. These data and estimates suggest that although screwworm males have
  relatively low population densities, they have significant excess mating
  capacity, and that production and release of competitive sterile males is
  important for the success of the screwworm eradication program.

AB: The age structure of screwworm, Cochliomyia hominivorax (Coquerel),
  populations was studied in the Guatemalan lowlands with the pteridine technique
  of age determination. Flies (95% were 4-15 d old) were captured on sentinel
  animals. Mean age was 7.5 d. The oldest fly captured was 21 d old. Most flies
  visiting wounds were reproductively mature females. Of these, about one-half
  oviposited once, one-third oviposited twice, and 1 in 10 completed three
  ovarian cycles (assuming a 3-d interval between clutches). Periodicity in adult
  capture rates may be related to the reproductive cycle. Results suggest that
  local populations are composed of a high proportion of synchronized cohorts.

AB: Filth fly parasites reared by commercial insectaries were released on two
  dairies (MO, DG) in southern California to determine their effect on
  populations of house flies, Musca domestica L., and stable flies, Stomoxys
  calcitrans (L.). Spalangia endius Walker, Muscidifurax raptorellus Kogan and
  Legner, and Muscidifurax zaraptor Kogan and Legner were released on the MO
  dairy from 1985 to 1987 in varying quantities. Parasitism by Muscidifurax
  zaraptor on the MO dairy was significantly higher (P < 0.05) from the field
  -collected stable fly (4.4%) and house fly (12.5%) pupae, compared with a
  control dairy (0.1%, stable fly; 1.3%, house fly). Muscidifurax zaraptor,
  released from April through October during 1987 on the DG dairy (350,000 per
  month), was not recovered in a significantly higher proportion from either fly
  species relative to the corresponding control dairy. No specimens of
  Muscidifurax raptorellus were recovered from the MO dairy. Parasite treatments
  had no apparent effect on adult populations of either fly species or on overall
  parasitism rate of field-collected stable fly (16.8%, MO; 17.2%, DG) and house
  fly (23.3%, MO; 20.9%, DG) pupae. Spalangia spp. were the predominant parasites
  recovered from field-collected stable fly and house fly pupae on all four
  dairies. Sentinel house fly pupae placed in fly-breeding sites on both release
  dairies were parasitized at a significantly higher rate, as compared with
  sentinel pupae on control dairies. The generic composition of parasites
  emerging from sentinel house fly pupae was 20.6% Spalangia spp. and 73.2%
  Muscidifurax spp., whereas in field-collected house fly pupae, Spalangia spp.
  and Muscidifurax spp. constituted 74.3 and 19.6% of the parasites, respectively.

AB: Results of a prospective serologic and virologic study of ruminant livestock
  in Central America and the Caribbean islands revealed bluetongue virus (BTV) to
  be enzootic in the 9 countries participating in the study. Bluetongue virus
  serotypes 1, 3, 6, and 12 were isolated from sentinel animals. To the authors'
  knowledge, these are the first isolations of BTV from the region studied and
  the first isolations of these serotypes in the Western Hemisphere. Clinical
  disease attributable to BTV infection was not observed in sentinel animals. The
  incidence pattern, with respect to age and geographic location, was determined.
  The need to evaluate the epizootiologic features of arthropod-borne viruses
  (arboviruses) on a regional ecologic basis is stressed.

AB: Sentinel Swiss (CD-1) mice, housed without filter bonnets, were seronegative
  for mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) for 8 consecutive months in an experimental
  colony of CD-1 mice. MHV titers had been detected sporadically in sentinel mice
  housed in this colony during a 2 year period. In an effort to determine whether
  MHV was still present in the colony, two methods of exposing sentinel mice to
  an animal room environment were compared under routine husbandry practices.
  Eight cages (12 mice per cage; 2 cages per rack) of experimental virus antibody
  free sentinel mice, housed without filter bonnets, were placed on the bottom
  shelf of 4 of 12 racks in the room. Twice each week, four cages of sentinel
  mice received a composite sample of dirty bedding (bedding used previously by
  mice in the room). The remaining four cages of experimental sentinels received
  fresh non-used bedding. Sentinel mice were bled at monthly intervals for MHV
  serology. After 4 months, mice from two cages which received dirty bedding
  seroconverted to MHV and mice from one cage were positive for Myobia musculi
  (mites). Three weeks later, all four cages of mice which received dirty bedding
  were positive for MHV and three were positive for mites. In contrast, only two
  of four cages of mice which received fresh bedding were positive for MHV and
  all were negative for mites. These findings indicate the importance of exposing
  sentinel mice to dirty bedding and that MHV and mites may go undetected for
  several months in a mouse colony when the incidence levels are low where
  standard sanitation procedures are used.

AB: The duration and patterns of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV)
  transmission were studied in eight index mice inoculated orally. Transmission
  was monitored by testing for seroconversion to TMEV in sentinel mice in direct
  contact with index mice and in other sentinel mice in contact with bedding
  soiled by index mice. For the first, 14 weeks after inoculation, two contact
  sentinels were housed with each index mouse for 1 week, then replaced with two
  new sentinels. For the remaining 16 weeks, contact sentinels were changed
  monthly. All index mice transmitted TMEV continuously (weekly) for 4 to 9
  weeks. Thereafter, six index mice transmitted virus intermittently. All index
  mice ceased transmitting TMEV 7 to 22 weeks post-inoculation. Results obtained
  from sentinel mice in contact with bedding soiled by index mice were 86%
  concordant with those using contact sentinel mice. Seven index mice were
  treated with cyclophosphamide or hydrocortisone 30 weeks post-inoculation. One
  cylophosphamide treated mouse reinitiated virus shedding.

AB: Blood samples were obtained from sentinel beef cattle at monthly intervals,
  and the sera were tested for antibodies, using a bluetongue virus (BTV)
  immuodiffusion test (IDT) and virus-neutralization test (VNT), for 5 BTV
  serotypes (2, 10, 11, 13, and 17) and 2 epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus
  (EHDV) serotypes (1 and 2). The cattle tested were transported from Tennessee
  to Texas in 1984 and 1985. All cattle were seronegative by the BTV IDT at the
  initial bleeding in Texas in 1984 and 1985. In 1984, 16 of 40 (40%) cattle
  seroconvertedas assessed by results of the BTV IDT. In 16 seropositive cattle
  in 1984, neutralizing antibodies were detected to BTV serotypes 10 (n = 7), 11
  (n = 3), and 17 (n = 11), and EHDV serotypes 1 (n = 1) and 2 (n = 7). In 1984,
  no cattle seroconverted to BTV-2 or BTV-13. In 1985, 10 of 36 (27.8%) cattle
  seroconverted as assessed by results of the IDT. Of the 10 seropositive cattle
  in 1985, neutralizing antibodies were detected to BTV serotypes 10 (n = 10), 11
  (n = 10), 13 (n = 7), and 17 (n = 5), and EHDV serotypes 1 (n = 1) and 2 (n =
  7). In 1985, no catttle seroconverted to BTV-2. Clinical diseases attributable
  to BTV or EHDV was not detected in these cattle in 1984 or 1985.

  Muscidifurax raptor Girault and Sanders, Pachycrepoideus vindemiae (Rondani),
  Spalangia sp., and Apanteles carpatus (Say), were recovered from house fly
  pupae exposed in controlled-environment, caged-layer poultry facilities during
  a 17-mo New York statewide survey. Overall, rates of parasitism were low,
  ranging from 0.2% in early spring to 14.0% in the fall. The number of fly pupae
  attacked by N. vitripennis was significantly higher than those killed by the
  other parasitoid species. Of all parasitized pupae collected in 1981, 76.9%
  were killed by N. vitripennis. In 1982, N. vitripennis was responsible for
  killing nearly 94.8% of all parasitized pupae. N. vitripennis was also the most
  abundant parasitoid, accounting for 95.5 and 99.2% of all parasitoids emerging
  from sentinel pupae during 1981 and 1982, respectively. In addition, N.
  vitripennis was the only parasitoid species observed to actively parasitize fly
  pupae in these facilities during cold winter months when temperatures in the
  first-floor manure pits ranged from 12 to 16 degrees C. All the other
  parasitoid species generally were active only during warm summer months.

AB: Japanese quail genetically selected on the basis of atherosclerosis
  susceptibility were tested for infection by Marek's disease herpesvirus (MDV).
  Viral DNA was detected in the atherosclerotic aortas of susceptible (SUS) quail
  by the technique of DNA hybridization. Southern blot analysis demonstrated that
  restriction mapping of aortic DNA was specific and different from that of MDV.
  Screening of quail embryos by dot-blot hybridization detected that MDV DNA
  existed in 100% of SUS quail tested. Resistant (RES) quail were a mixed
  population, with 16% of embryos resembling the SUS group. Functional MDV was
  not found by a number of methods including virus isolation, serological test,
  and exposure of sentinel chicks to SUS quail. These results suggest that the
  SUS quail possess a portion of MDV genome in the germline, and the viral genes
  have been coselected by their susceptibility to cholesterol-induced
  atherosclerosis.

AB: A 168-day study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of morantel tartrate
  sustained-release bolus (MSRB) in controlling gastrointestinal parasitism in
  weaned calves during autumn-winter grazing in the temperate climate of southern
  United States. Sixty-two weanling Angus heifers were used to assess treatment
  differences. Six sentinel heifers were necropsied to assess pretrial
  gastrointestinal worm counts. The remaining 56 heifers were assigned to 4
  groups of 14 heifers each and were placed on four 4.86-hectare dormant Bermuda
  grass pastures (1 group/pasture) that had been no-till interseeded with cereal
  rye in early October. Heifers in 2 groups were given 1 MSRB in early November;
  the other 2 groups served as nonmedicated controls. Three heifers (principals)
  from each of the 4 groups were necropsied on posttreatment days 57, 112, and
  168 (end of study) for total worm recovery. Eight 5-month-old tracer steers,
  raised worm-free from birth, grazed the 4 pastures (2/pasture) for the first 21
  days of the study and then were kept in drylot for 21 days before being
  necropsied. Level of larval contamination of pastures grazed by control and
  MSRB-treated heifers were comparable, because the mean number of nematodes
  recovered from tracer steers grazing the control and MSRB pastures were 47,449
  and 53,835, respectively. At 28 days after treatment, MSRB-treated heifers had
  lower (P < 0.05) mean egg counts/g of feces than did control heifers (280 vs
  13). Although the magnitude of the differences between treated and control
  heifers decreased as the study progressed, the differences were significant (P
  < 0.05) at each sampling date throughout the 168-day study. Necropsy of 6
  sentinels revealed a mean nematode count of 43,135. Necropsy of principal
  heifers revealed higher mean worm counts in control heifers, compared with
  those in MSRB-treated heifers on day 57 (35,758 vs 2,113; P < 0.05), 112
  (20,740 vs 13,764; P = 0.15), and 168 (27,252 vs 6,957; P < 0.05). There were
  no differences in average daily weight gain between control and MSRB-treated
  heifers (0.53 and 0.53 kg, respectively) over the duration of the study,
  However, MSRB significantly (P < 0.05) reduced egg counts and actual worm
  numbers during the entire 168-day autumn-winter grazing study.

AB: Five virus strains with identical antigenic properties were isolated from 3
  RBC suspensions obtained from 2 healthy sentinel calves and from 2 pools of
  Culicoides oxystoma in cultures of a hamster lung cell line (HmLu-1). The virus
  was tentatively named Chuzan virus. The Chuzan virus was classified as a new
  member of the Palyam subgroup of the genus Orbivirus on the basis of its
  physicochemical, morphologic, and antigenic properties.

AB: The dispersal of mass released Muscidifurax zaraptor Kogan & Legner, a
  solitary pupal parasitoid of house flies and stable flies, was monitored in two
  fly breeding habitats. Under a raised feedbunk, parasitism ranged from 32.5 to
  63.5% when monitored by a linear arrangement of sentinel house fly pupae.
  Dispersal patterns were not apparent; average parasitoid emergence from
  sentinel pupae on each side of the release point were not significantly
  different. Parasitoid releases in open-piled manure generally produced lower
  parasitism levels than under the feedbunk. In open-piled manure, M. zaraptor
  tended to move more in one direction (northerly) than the other. Sentinel pupae
  were parasitized as far as 8 m from the release site. There was no apparent
  correlation between the numbers of female M. zaraptor released and the levels
  of parasitism achieved in either habitat. Increasing the density of sentinel
  pupae under the feedbunk significantly decreased parasitoid emergence; however,
  changing the pupal density in open-piled manure had no effect on parasitoid
  emergence.

AB: Abstract: Athymic nude mice used as sentinel animals in a mouse holding room
  died of pneumonia 17 to 32 weeks after being placed in the room. Lesions in the
  pulmonary parenchyma consisted of monocytic exudate, epithelial cell necrosis,
  hemorrhage, fibrin deposition and interstitial fibrosis. Septal edema, septal
  cell necrosis and septal capillary stasis were common, but there was limited
  sloughing of bronchial lining epithelium. Indirect fluorescence microscopy
  (IFA) of lung sections using pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) antibody was
  positive. The pneumonia and IFA results were reproduced in euthymic mice
  inoculated experimentally with lung suspension from naturally infected ice or
  with tissue culture fluid from cultures infected with American Type Culture
  Collection PVM. The lungs of a naturally infected nude mouse were studied by
  transmission electron microscopy. Virus growth was found on Type II alveolar
  epithelium and on poorly differentiated replacement alveolar epithelium. Virus
  particles appeared as long exophytic filaments containing one to six linearly
  arranged nucleocapsids. Inclusion bodies and intracelular virus structures were
  not observed.
