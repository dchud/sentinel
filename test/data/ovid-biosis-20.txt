AB  - The site-directed mutagenesis of HA gene was made by using PCR, and mismatches were introduced into primers. Mutagenesis was performed in a three-step PCR. The amplified fragments from the second PCR which contained the mutation site were cloned into the pcDNA3 vector, named pHAm. The sequencing analysis showed that the mutation site was correct. The amino acid sequence at the cleavage site of the HA protein was from RKKR down arrow GLF to RSSR down arrow GLF. The recombinant plasmid pHAm was transiently transfected into 293T cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA), confirmed expression of the HA protein on the cell membrane the mutant HA gene was a promising candidate for further studies.

AB  - Several H6 subtype avian A influenza viruses were isolated from aquatic birds in some live bird markets when we surveyed the ecology of the influenza in East China for more than two years and identified by specific RT-PCR. In this paper, the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) gene of one representative virus named A/Duck/Yangzhou/233/2002 (H6N2) (Dk/YZ/23.3/02) had been sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of the H6 gene sequences available in the Influenza Sequence Database showed that the Dk/YZ/233/02 viruses cluster together with Dk/HK/3461/99 (H6N1) and Ck/Taiwan/na3/98 (H6N1). Phylogenetic analysis of the N2 NA genes of Dk/YZ/233/02 revealed that the NA gene of DkNZ/233/02 had genetically close relationships with that of H9N2 viruses isolated from duck in Japan and from chickens in South Korea, which were distinct from those of Ck/Beijing/94 (H9N2). The sequence of cleavage site between HA1 and HA2 of Dk/YZ/233/02 is P-Q-I-E-T-R-D, which was the typical characterization of the LPAIV.

AB  - In early 2004, an H5N2 avian influenza virus (AM that met the molecular criteria for classification as a highly pathogenic AIV was isolated from chickens in the state of Texas in the United States. However, clinical manifestations in the affected flock were consistent with avian influenza caused by a low-pathogenicity AIV and the representative virus (A/chicken/Texas/298313/04 [TX/04]) was not virulent for experimentally inoculated chickens. The hemagglutinin (HA) gene of the TX/04 isolate was similar in sequence to A/chicken/Texas/ 167280-4/02 (TX/02), a low-pathogenicity AIV isolate recovered from chickens in Texas in 2002. However, the TX/04 isolate had one additional basic amino acid at the HA cleavage site, which could be attributed to a single point mutation. The TX/04 isolate was similar in sequence to TX/02 isolate in several internal genes (NP, M, and NS), but some genes (PA, PB1, and PB2) had sequence of a clearly different origin. The TX/04 isolate also had a stalk deletion in the NA gene, characteristic of a chicken-adapted AIV. By analyzing viruses constructed by in vitro mutagenesis followed by reverse genetics, we found that the pathogenicity of the TX/04 virus could be increased in vitro and in vivo by the insertion of an additional basic amino acid at the HA cleavage site and not by the loss of a glycosylation site near the cleavage site. Our study provides the genetic and biologic characteristics of the TX/04 isolate, which highlight the complexity of the polygenic nature of the virulence of influenza viruses.

AB  - The present study reports the clinical, virological and pathological findings observed in a natural outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in farmed commercial ducks. The ducks developed clinical signs, including mild respiratory distress, depression, mild diarrhoea, loss of appetite and increasing mortality (up to 12%). At necropsy, multifocal mottled necrosis was commonly found in the pancreas with splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and swollen kidneys. Microscopically, there was necrotized pancreatitis and hepatitis, and lymphocytic meningoencephalitis and myocarditis. Influenza viral antigen was demonstrated in areas closely associated with histopathological lesion. Avian influenza virus was isolated from the caecal tonsil, faeces, and kidney of the domestic ducks. The isolated virus was identified as a highly pathogenic H5N1, with a haemagglutinin proteolytic cleavage site deduced amino acid sequence of... QREKRKKR/GLFGAIAG... In order to determine the pathogenicity of the isolate, eight 6-week-old specific pathogen free chickens were inoculated intravenously with the virus, and all birds died within 24 h after inoculation. This is the first report of an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza with clinical signs in commercial domestic ducks in South Korea.

AB  - Avian influenza A virus subtype H5N1 can infect humans to cause a severe viral pneumonia with mortality rates of more than 30%. The biological basis for this unusual disease severity is not fully understood. We previously demonstrated that in contrast to human influenza A virus subtypes including H1N1 or H3N2, the H5N1 virus associated with the "bird flu" outbreak in Hong Kong in 1997 (H5N1/97) hyperinduces proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), in primary human macrophages in vitro. To delineate the molecular mechanisms involved, we analyzed the role of transcription factor NF-kappa B and cellular kinases in TNF-alpha dysregulation. H5N1 and H1N1 viruses did not differ in the activation of NF-kappa B or degradation Of I kappa B-alpha in human macrophages. However, we demonstrated that unlike H1N1 virus, H5N1/97 strongly activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), including p38 MAPK and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2. Specific inhibitors of p38 MAPK significantly reduced the H5N1/97-induced TNF-alpha expression in macrophages. Taken together, our findings suggest that H5N1/97-mediated hyperinduction of cytokines involves the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. These results may provide insights into the pathogenesis of H5N1 disease and rationales for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

AB  - H9N2 subtype influenza virus has become worldwide and prevalent in China. Previous studies illustrated that at least three sublineages had been established in terrestrial poultry of Eurasian avian. In this presentation, eight full-length genes of an H9N2 strain, A/Chicken/Shanghai/F/98 (Ck/SH/F/98) were obtained. Sequence analysis and phylogenetic studies were conducted by comparing eight genes with those of all the available H9N2 strains from the GenBank. The results showed that four genes ( HA, NA, M and NS genes) of Ck/SH/F/98 were incorporated into the sublineage represented by the early mainland China strain, Ck/BJ/1/94. However, the other four of RNP genes of Ck/SH/F/98 did not show close relationship with those of the three known sublineages' viruses. Therefore, Ck/SH/F/98 was a natural reassortant between different sublineages. In addition, comparison showed that Ck/SH/F/98 could be a putative precursor of a later isolate from southern China, Dk/ST/1605/01, with at least six genes of both closely related, indicating genes of Ck/SH/F/98 and early isolates had ever been circulating. Further comparison in terms of molecular markers of species specificity of HA1 revealed that DK/ST/1605/01 also resembled Ck/SH/F/98 more than a common earlier duck strain. The results supported the idea of two-way transmission between terrestrial and aquatic birds that emphasized the importance to raise concerns on the natural evolution of all the eight genes of H9N2 avian influenza viruses.

AB  - In 2003, H5N1 avian influenza virus infections were diagnosed in two Hong Kong residents who had visited the Fujian province in mainland China, affording us the opportunity to characterize one of the viral isolates, A/Hong Kong/213/03 (HK213; H5N1). In contrast to H5N1 viruses isolated from humans during the 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong, HK213 retained several features of aquatic bird viruses, including the lack of a deletion in the neuraminidase stalk and the absence of additional oligosaccharide chains at the globular head of the hemagglutinin molecule. It demonstrated weak pathogenicity in mice and ferrets but caused lethal infection in chickens. The original isolate failed to produce disease in ducks but became more pathogenic after five passages. Taken together, these findings portray the HK213 isolate as an aquatic avian influenza A virus without the molecular changes associated with the replication of H5N1 avian viruses in land-based poultry such as chickens. This case challenges the view that adaptation to land-based poultry is a prerequisite for the replication of aquatic avian influenza A viruses in humans.

AB  - A mouse-adapted influenza A virus, A/equine/London/1416/73-MA (H7N7) caused viral pneumonia, ganglionitis and encephalitis after intranasal inoculation in mice. Virological and pathological data suggested that this virus spreads to the brain by both hematogenous and transneuronal routes, and produces encephalitic lesions similar to those seen in mice infected with H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses by intranasal infection. Some mice infected with this strain were affected by aspiration pneumonia, which may be caused by neurogenic dysfunction of the pharyngeal/laryngeal reflex due to brain stem encephalitis.

AB  - Two low-pathogenicity (LP) and two high-pathogenicity (HP) avian influenza (AI) viruses were inoculated into chickens by the intranasal route to determine the presence of the Al virus in breast and thigh meat as well as any potential role that meat could fill as a transmission vehicle. The LPAI viruses caused localized virus infections in respiratory and gastrointestinal (GI) tracts. Virus was not detected in blood, bone marrow, or breast and thigh meat, and feeding breast and thigh meat from virus-infected birds did not transmit the virus. In contrast to the two LPAI viruses, A/chicken/Pennsylvania/1370/1983 (H5N2) HPAI virus caused respiratory and GI tract infections with systemic spread, and virus was detected in blood, bone marrow, and breast and thigh meat. Feeding breast or thigh meat from HPAI (H5N2) virus-infected chickens to other chickens did not transmit the infection. However, A/chicken/Korea/ES/2003 (H5N1) HPAI virus produced high titers of virus in the breast meat, and feeding breast meat from these infected chickens to other chickens resulted in Al virus infection and death. Usage of either recombinant fowlpox vaccine with H5 Al gene insert or inactivated Al whole-virus vaccines prevented HPAI virus in breast meat. These data indicate that the potential for LPAI virus appearing in meat of infected chickens is negligible, while the potential for having HPAI virus in meat from infected chickens is high, but proper usage of vaccines call prevent HPAI virus from being present in meat.

AB  - Five 34-wk-old turkey breeder layer flocks in separate houses of 2550 birds each in a single farm in Ohio experienced a drop in egg production from late January to early February 2004. Tracheal swabs (n = 60), cloacal swabs (n = 50), and convalescent sera (n = 110) from the flocks were Submitted to the laboratory for diagnostics. Virus isolation was attempted in specific-pathogen free embryonating chicken eggs and Vero and MDCK cells. Virus characterization was performed using agar gel immunodiffusion, the hemagglutination test, the hemagglutination inhibition rest, the virus neutralization test, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. A presumptive influenza virus was successfully propagated and isolated on the first passage in MDCK cells, but initially not in Vero cells or specific-pathogen free chicken embryos. After two passages in MDCK cells, it was possible to propagate the isolate in specific-pathogen free chicken embryos. Preliminary sequence analysis of the isolated virus confirmed that it was influenza A virus with almost 100% (235/236) identity with the matrix gene of a swine influenza A virus, A/Swine/Illinois/100084/01 (H1N2). However, it was not possible to Subtype the virus using conventional serotyping methods. The results of genetic characterization of the isolated virus showed that it was the H3N2 subtype and was designated as A/Turkey/OH/313053/04 (H3N2). Phylogenetic analysis of the eight gene segments of the virus showed that A/Turkey/OH/313053/04 (H3N2) isolate was most closely related to the triple-reassortant H3N2 swine viruses [A/Swine/W1/14094/99 (H3N2)] that have been circulating among pigs in the United States since 1998, which contains gene segments from avian, swine, and human viruses. The A/Turkey/OH/313053/04 (H3N2) isolated from turkeys in this study was classified as a low pathogenic avian influenza A virus because it only caused a drop in egg production with minor other clinical signs and no mortality.

AB  - Highly pathogenic avian influenza A (subtype H5N1) is threatening to cause a human pandemic of potentially devastating proportions. We used a stochastic influenza simulation model for rural Southeast Asia to investigate the effectiveness of targeted antiviral prophylaxis, quarantine, and pre-vaccination in containing an emerging influenza strain at the source. If the basic reproductive number (R-o) was below 1.60, our simulations showed that a prepared response with targeted antivirals would have a high probability of containing the disease, In that case, an antiviral agent stockpile on the order of 100,000 to 1 million courses for treatment and prophylaxis would be sufficient. If pre-vaccination occurred, then targeted antiviral prophylaxis. could be effective for containing strains with an R-o as high as 2.1. Combinations of targeted antiviral prophylaxis, pre-vaccination, and quarantine could contain strains with an R-o as high as 2.4.
