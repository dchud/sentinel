TI  - Detection of dengue virus by real-time polymerase chain reaction with TaqMan MGB probe.  [Chinese]
SO  - Chinese Journal of Zoonoses. Editorial Committee of Chinese Journal of Zoonoses, Health and Anti-epidemic Station of Fujian Province, Fuzhou, China: 2005. 21: 8, 716-720. 7 ref. 
AB  - A sensitive, specific and reproducible method to detect dengue virus in clinical specimens was developed. A set of specific primer and TaqMan MGB probe used in real time polymerase chain reaction was developed based on the conservative gene of 3' terminal non-coding region of dengue virus. The specificity and sensitivity of the method were evaluated by testing with serum samples from 26 patients with dengue fever during 1998-2004, 15 patients with Japanese B encephalitis, four standard serotype dengue virus strains, 23 local isolates of dengue virus isolated during 1978-97, West Nile virus, Japanese B encephalitis virus, measles virus, and Chikungunya virus [China]. The plasmid DNA containing the gene fragment of 3' terminal non-coding region of dengue virus type 1 was used as the positive control. The lowest detection limit of the developed assays was about five genomic copies per reaction. All dengue virus and serum samples of patients with dengue fever showed positi!
 ve results, with corresponding negative results in all the non-dengue virus samples. It is concluded that this newly developed assay to detect dengue virus with TaqMan MGB probe may be considered as an ideal method for the early laboratory diagnosis of dengue fever.

TI  - Antiviral drug discovery for emerging diseases and bioterrorism threats.
SO  - Antiviral drug discovery for emerging diseases and bioterrorism threats. John Wiley & Sons Ltd, Chichester, UK: 2005. x + 419 pp.. many ref. 
AB  - This the first book that tackles head-on the myriad viral threats for which no effective drug treatments currently exist. Among the threats covered are potential bioterrorism agents and emerging viruses such as smallpox, influenza, Ebola, Marburg, SARS, Nipah, Hendra, Lassa fever, Junin, dengue, West Nile, and yellow fever. The editor of this publication has assembled an international team of leading experts, giving readers a cutting-edge view on current drug discovery efforts to find novel antiviral agents in the battle to combat these diseases and threats. Following a general introduction to the problems of emerging diseases and bioterrorism, each chapter discusses potential strategies for the discovery of antiviral agents, reveals recent findings, and points to promising directions for further research. Many of the contributors have honed their knowledge and offer unique insights based on their work with powerful viruses such as herpes and HIV. A variety of differen!
 t strategies and targets are discussed in the ongoing exploration for effective treatment modalities. Specific targets of the virus's genomes and proteomes are presented as sources for antiviral agent prospectors. These include interferon evasion proteins, proteases, helicases, RNA polymerases, and methyl transferases. In addition, other targets presented are s-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase and inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase. Generic approaches discussed include lethal mutagenesis, immunocamouflage, and prenylation inhibitors. Prodrugs and acyclic nucleoside monophosphates are among the antiviral countermeasures presented from the medicinal/bioorganic chemical arsenal.

AB  - Flaviviral diseases are widespread in tropical regions and are caused by infections due to viruses such as dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, and West Nile. Information that has been obtained from genetic, molecular biological, biochemical, and structural studies has elucidated the key processes involved in the life cycle of flaviviruses and identified several therapeutic targets. These include viral structural proteins such as the envelope protein and nonstructural proteins such as the viral protease, helicase, RNA polymerase, and methyl transferase. This chapter summarizes the information that is currently available on each of these proteins and the work that is being done to target them using suitable inhibitory compounds. The molecular details of viral entry, replication, and assembly are discussed.

AB  - This paper describes the preparations made for the advent of West Nile virus (WNV) activity in Fresno County, California, USA, in 2004, which included surveillance, public information and education, mosquito (Culex) control activities (e.g., use of adulticides in mosquito breeding areas), reporting of dead birds, and emergency services. Despite these preparations, 11 human cases, 15 equine cases, 96 positive birds and 13 positive mosquito pools were observed in the county by 28 September 2004. It is concluded that the expected outcome of the control activities was not met, and an evaluation of the experience is suggested.

AB  - A study was conducted to determine the best trap height for optimal capture of Culex species; to investigate whether Culex is active during the day in the tree canopy; and to examine the presence of West Nile virus (WNV) in trapped mosquitoes. The study site was located at the Cattails Golf Course, Alamosa, Colorado, USA. Modified CDC light traps were placed at 35.2 ft (trap 10), 16.4 ft (trap 2) and 5 ft (trap 3) on a cottonwood tree. The traps were run for 14 consecutive days and nights. All trapped mosquitoes were tested for WNV. The results revealed that C. tarsalis was the only Culex species caught in the traps, and few mosquitoes from other genera were caught. 141, 157 and 172 C. tarsalis were caught in traps 1, 2 and 3, respectively; the difference was not significant. Seven out of 178 mosquitoes were collected during the day, and all day-flying mosquitoes were C. tarsalis. WNV was not detected in the trapped mosquitoes. It is suggested that trap placement in th!
 e canopy is not necessary and the current system of monitoring adult mosquito populations at night at a trap height of 4-5 ft is sufficient.

SO  - Nature (London). Nature Publishing Group, London, UK: 2005. 437: 7059, 764-768. 30 ref. 
AB  - West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus closely related to the human epidemic-causing dengue, yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis viruses. In establishing infection these icosahedral viruses undergo endosomal membrane fusion catalysed by envelope glycoprotein rearrangement of the putative receptor-binding domain III (DIII) and exposure of the hydrophobic fusion loop. Humoral immunity has an essential protective function early in the course of West Nile virus infection. Here, we investigate the mechanism of neutralization by the E16 monoclonal antibody that specifically binds DIII. Structurally, the E16 antibody Fab fragment engages 16 residues positioned on four loops of DIII, a consensus neutralizing epitope sequence conserved in West Nile virus and distinct in other flaviviruses. The E16 epitope protrudes from the surface of mature virions in three distinct environments, and docking studies predict Fab binding will leave five-fold clustered epitopes exposed!
 . We also show that E16 inhibits infection primarily at a step after viral attachment, potentially by blocking envelope glycoprotein conformational changes. Collectively, our results suggest that a vaccine strategy targeting the dominant DIII epitope may elicit safe and effective immune responses against flaviviral diseases.

SO  - Avian Diseases. American Association of Avian Pathologists, Kennett Square, USA: 2005. 49: 3, 371-375. 25 ref. 
AB  - We assayed for West Nile virus (WNV) antibodies to determine the presence and prevalence of WNV infection in three raptor populations in southeast Wisconsin during 2003-04. This study was conducted in the framework of ongoing population studies that started before WNV was introduced to the study area. For 354 samples, 88% of 42 adult Cooper's hawks (Accipiter cooperii), 2.1% of 96 nestling Cooper's hawks, 9.2% of 141 nestling red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis), and 12% of 73 nestling great horned owls (Bubo virginianus) tested positive for WNV antibodies by the constant virus-serum dilution neutralization test. Samples that tested positive for WNV antibodies were collected across a wide variety of habitat types, including urban habitats (both high and low density), roads, parking areas, recreational areas, croplands, pastures, grasslands, woodlands, and wetlands. Based on the increased prevalence and significantly higher WNV antibody titers in adults compared with ne!
 stlings, we suggest that nestlings with detectable antibody levels acquired these antibodies through passive transmission from the mother during egg production. Low levels of WNV antibodies in nestlings could serve as a surrogate marker of exposure in adult raptor populations. Based on breeding population densities and reproductive success over the past 15 yr, we found no apparent adverse effects of WNV infections on these wild raptor populations.

AB  - Big brown (Eptesicus fuscus) and Mexican free-tailed (Tadarida brasiliensis) bats were inoculated with the New York 99 strain of West Nile virus to assess their potential to serve as amplifying hosts and determine the clinical effect of infection. Groups of three or four bats were bled at daily intervals between 1 and 6 days after inoculation to determine the pattern of viraemia. Beginning 2 days after inoculation, virus was isolated each day from one or more E. fuscus bats, in titres ranging from 10 to 180 plaque-forming units per millilitre of serum. Virus was not isolated from any of the sera collected from T. brasiliensis bats. None of the bats from either species showed clinical signs associated with exposure to virus. Sera from an additional 149 bats collected in Louisiana in 2002 during an epizootic of West Nile fever were tested for antibodies to virus, and two were found to be positive. These data suggest that bats from these two widely distributed species are!
  unlikely to serve as amplifying hosts for West Nile virus.

SO  - Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications. Elsevier Inc., San Diego, USA: 2005. 334: 2, 714-720. 48 ref. 
AB  - West Nile (Sarafend) virus [WN(S)V] has been shown to egress by budding at the plasma membrane of infected cells. However, the region influencing this mode of virus release remains to be deciphered. In this study, we have constructed three chimeric clones in which specific regions of West Nile (Wengler) virus [WN(W)V] were replaced for the corresponding regions of WN(S)V in the full-length infectious clone of WN(S)V to define the region responsible for the cis-mode of WN(S)V maturation. The WN(W)V matures by the trans-mode. All of the resulting chimeric viruses were found to be infective. Transmission electron microscopy analyses performed in Vero cells infected with these chimeric viruses disclosed that the 5' end of the WN(S)V genome plays a major role in influencing the process of maturation at the plasma membrane.

SO  - Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Epidemiology Program Office, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, USA: 2005. 54: Supplement, 55-62. 27 ref. 
AB  - Introduction: In concert with increased concerns regarding both biological terrorism and new natural infectious disease threats (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome and West Nile virus), as a result of advances in medical informatics, various data sources are available to epidemiologists for routine, prospective monitoring of public health. The synthesis of this evidence requires tools to find anomalies within various data stream combinations while maintaining manageable false alarm rates. Objectives: The objectives of this report are to establish statistical hypotheses to define the compound multivariate problem of surveillance systems, present statistical methods for testing these hypotheses, and examine results of applying these methods to simulated and actual data. Methods: Canonical problems of parallel monitoring and consensus monitoring are considered in this report. Modified Bonferroni methods are examined for parallel monitoring. Both multiple univariate a!
 nd multivariate methods are applied for consensus monitoring. A multivariate adaptation of Monte Carlo trials, using the injection of epidemic-curve-like signals in the multiple data streams of interest, is presented for evaluation of the various tests. Results: The Monte Carlo test results demonstrate that the multiple univariate combination methods of Fisher and Edgington provide the most robust detection performance across the scenarios tested. As the number of data streams increases, methods based on Hotelling's T2 offer added sensitivity for certain signal scenarios. This potential advantage is clearer when strong correlation exists among the data streams. Conclusion: Parallel and consensus monitoring tools must be blended to enable a surveillance system with distributed sensitivity and controlled alert rates. Whether a multiple univariate or multivariate approach should be used for consensus monitoring depends on the number and distribution of useful data sources and !
 also on their covariance structure and stationarity. Strong, c!
 onsisten
t correlation among numerous sources warrants the examination of multivariate control charts.

SO  - Journal of Infectious Diseases. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, USA: 2005. 192: 2, 287-295. 26 ref. 
AB  - Golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) experimentally infected with West Nile virus (WNV) developed chronic renal infection and persistent shedding of virus in urine for up to 8 months, despite initial rapid clearance of virus from blood and the timely appearance of high levels of specific neutralizing antibodies. Infectious WNV could be recovered by direct culture of their urine and by cocultivation of kidney tissue for up to 247 days after initial infection. Only moderate histopathologic changes were observed in the kidneys or brain of the chronically infected hamsters, although WNV antigen was readily detected by immunohistochemistry within epithelium, interstitial cells, and macrophages in the distal renal tubules. Comparison of WNV isolates from serial urine samples from individual hamsters over several months indicated that the virus underwent both genetic and phenotypic changes during persistent infection. These findings are similar to previous reports of persis!
 tent infection with tickborne encephalitis and Modoc viruses.

TI  - The suitability of yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis vaccines for immunization against West Nile virus.
SO  - Vaccine. Elsevier, Oxford, UK: 2005. 23: 39, 4785-4792. 25 ref. 
AB  - Seven volunteers involved in flavivirus studies have been immunized with commercial Japanese encephalitis and yellow fever vaccines JE-VAX and YF-VAX. Strong homologous and cross-reactive with West Nile virus (WNV) antibody responses with titers 1:1600 to 1:51200 were found in all donors. All donors developed high levels of yellow fever virus (YFV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) neutralizing antibodies with titers 1:50 to 1:1600 and 1:20 to 1:640, respectively, and WNV neutralizing antibodies with titers 1:10 to 1:80. In contrast, predominantly YF-specific cell-mediated immunity was detected in all immunized donors. Responses to YFV were long lasting, but the anti-JEV humoral immunity was found to decrease with time. Cross-reactive anti-WNV responses were following the same trend dropping below detectable level at 4 years post-immunization and sharply coming back after booster immunization with the JE vaccine. Thus, immunization with the commercial flavivirus JE!
  vaccine may be beneficial for individuals at high risk of exposure to WNV, such as personnel involved in WN research.

TI  - West Nile virus detection in the organs of naturally infected blue jays (Cyanocitta cristata).
SO  - Journal of Wildlife Diseases. Wildlife Disease Association, Lawrence, USA: 2005. 41: 2, 354-362. 18 ref. 
AB  - Blue jays (Cyanocitta cristata) are an effective indicator species for West Nile virus (WNV) and may be regionally important in surveillance efforts. The sites of WNV replication and sensitivity of virus detection techniques are undefined for blue jays. The objectives of this study were to describe the gross and microscopic pathology associated with natural WNV infection in blue jays, as well as determine the most appropriate tissues to be used for virus isolation, reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) techniques. Blue jays were collected in Georgia, USA, between May and September 2001. Initial screening by virus isolation indicated that 36 of 59 blue jays chosen for evaluation were WNV positive. From this group, 20 positive and five negative birds were chosen to compare virus detection techniques. Six positive and five negative birds were selected for histopathology examination. Splenomegaly and poor body condition were!
  the most consistent gross findings among positive birds. The most consistent histopathologic findings in the tissues of WNV-positive blue jays were mononuclear leukocytosis and epicarditis/myocarditis. Brain, heart, and lung had the highest viral titers, and WNV antigen was most often detected by IHC in heart, kidney, liver, and lung. Reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction proved to be the most sensitive diagnostic test applied in this study irrespective of the tissue type. Brain tissue could be used effectively for both virus isolation and RT-nPCR, and this tissue is simple to remove and process. The success of IHC is highly dependent on tissue selection, and the use of multiple tissues including heart, kidney, liver, or lung is recommended.

TI  - DNA probe array for the simultaneous identification of herpesviruses, enteroviruses, and flaviviruses.
SO  - Journal of Clinical Microbiology. American Society for Microbiology (ASM), Washington, USA: 2005. 43: 8, 3779-3787. 40 ref. 
AB  - Viral infections of the central nervous system (CNS) are caused by a variety of viruses, namely, herpesviruses, enteroviruses, and flaviviruses. The similar clinical signs provoked by these viruses make the diagnosis difficult. We report on the simultaneous detection of these major CNS pathogens using amplification by PCR and detection of amplified products using DNA microarray technology. Consensus primers were used for the amplification of all members of each genus. Sequences specific for the identification of each virus species were selected from the sequence alignments of each target gene and were synthesized on a high-density microarray. The amplified products were pooled, labelled, and cleaved, followed by hybridization on a single array. This method was successfully used to identify herpesviruses, namely, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), HSV-2, and cytomegalovirus; all serotypes of human enteroviruses; and five flaviviruses (West Nile virus, dengue viruses, !
 and Langat virus). This approach, which used highly conserved consensus primers for amplification and specific sequences for identification, would be extremely useful for the detection of variants and would probably help solve some unexplained cases of encephalitis. The analytical sensitivity of the method was shown to be 500 genome equivalents ml-1 for HSV-1, 0.3 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID50s) ml-1 for the enterovirus coxsackievirus A9, and 200 TCID50s ml-1 for West Nile virus. The clinical sensitivity of this method must now be evaluated.

SO  - Transfusion. Blackwell Publishing, Boston, USA: 2005. 45: 9, 1540-1541. 5 ref. 
AB  - The sensitivity of 2 commercially available nucleic acid screening assays (Procleix WNV assay and TaqScreen WNV first-generation assay) for screening of blood donations for West Nile virus (WNV) were compared. Four blood transfusion centres in France (2 centres for each assay) tested unlabelled serial dilutions of the same donated blood samples (6 replicates for each dilution) in a blinded evaluation format. The detection limit of each assay for individual (unpooled) samples was determined using 2-fold serial dilutions (56-0.22 copies/ml) of Accurun WNV RNA nucleic acid panels. The effect of pooling was evaluated using 2-fold dilutions of the same sample (500-1.95 copies/ml). In all cases, the detection limit (95% hit rate) was calculated by probit analysis. Results revealed that the predicted 95% detection rates for Procleix WNV assay using individual samples were 10 and 34 copies/ml in the 2 blood transfusion centres. Under the same conditions, the predicted 95% dete!
 ction rate for TaqScreen WNV first-generation assay was approximately 200 copies/ml. The influence of anticoagulants showed little or no effect on sensitivity. Using pooled samples, the 95% detection rate for Taqscreen WNV first-generation assay (pools of 6 samples) was approximately 1200 copies/ml. For Procleix WNV assay, the 95% detection rates were 112 and 396 copies/ml for pools of 8 samples, and 494 and 612 copies/ml for pools of 16 samples. It is concluded that the Procleix WNV assay is more sensitive than the TaqScreen WNV first-generation assay for testing both individual and pooled samples for WNV.

SO  - Journal of Zoo and Wildlife Medicine. American Association of Zoo Veterinarians, Lawrence, USA: 2005. 36: 2, 257-264. 18 ref. 
AB  - West Nile virus affects many animals, but the highest prevalence of morbidity and mortality is observed in birds, horses, and humans. The purpose of this study was to determine a protocol in birds of prey and corvids, using a vaccine developed for horses. The birds were assigned to five groups. Groups 1-4 received 0.25 ml, 0.5 ml, 0.75 ml, and 1.0 ml, respectively, and group 5 served as a control group. The greatest percentage of seroconversion (58.3%) was observed in the vaccine group that received a dose of 1.0 ml administered thrice, 3 wk apart. This report demonstrates that a vaccine developed for equines against West Nile virus can be administered to birds.

SO  - Emerging Infectious Diseases. National Center for Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, USA: 2005. 11: 9, 1343-1350. 40 ref. 
AB  - Mosquitoes and mosquitoborne disease transmission are sensitive to hydrologic variability. If local hydrologic conditions can be monitored or modelled at the scales at which these conditions affect the population dynamics of vector mosquitoes and the diseases they transmit, a means for monitoring or modelling mosquito populations and mosquitoborne disease transmission may be realized. We review how hydrologic conditions have been associated with mosquito abundances and mosquitoborne disease transmission and discuss the advantages of different measures of hydrologic variability. We propose that the useful application of any measure of hydrologic conditions requires additional consideration of the scales for both the hydrologic measurement and the vector control interventions that will be used to mitigate an outbreak of vector-borne disease. Our efforts to establish operational monitoring of St. Louis encephalitis virus and West Nile virus transmission in Florida are als!

SO  - Emerging Infectious Diseases. National Center for Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, USA: 2005. 11: 9, 1370-1375. 34 ref. 
AB  - New York State used the health commerce system to monitor the number of West Nile virus (WNV) human disease cases and the density of dead crows. In each year from 2001 to 2003 and for the 3 years combined, persons living in New York counties (excluding New York City) with elevated weekly dead crow densities (above a threshold value of 0.1 dead crows per square mile) had higher risk (2.0-8.6 times) for disease caused by WNV within the next 2 weeks than residents of counties reporting fewer dead crows per square mile. This type of index can offer a real-time, relatively inexpensive window into viral activity in time for prevention and control. Changes in reporting, bird populations, and immunity may require that thresholds other than 0.1 be used in later years or in other areas.

SO  - Emerging Infectious Diseases. National Center for Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, USA: 2005. 11: 9, 1399-1404. 27 ref. 
AB  - Human cases of West Nile virus (WNV) disease appeared in St. Tammany and Tangipahoa Parishes in southeastern Louisiana, USA in June 2002. Cases peaked during July, then rapidly declined. We conducted mosquito collections from August 3 to August 15 at residences of patients with confirmed and suspected WNV disease to estimate species composition, relative abundance, and WNV infection rates. A total of 31 215 mosquitoes representing 25 species were collected by using primarily gravid traps and CO2-baited light traps. Mosquitoes containing WNV RNA were obtained from 5 of 11 confirmed case sites and from 1 of 3 sites with non-WNV disease. WNV RNA was detected in 9 mosquito pools, including 7 Culex quinquefasciatus, 1 Cx. salinarius, and 1 Coquillettidia perturbans. Mosquito infection rates among sites ranged from 0.8/1000 to 10.9/1000. Results suggest that C. quinquefasciatus was the primary epizootic/epidemic vector, with other species possibly playing a secondary role.

Twelve specimens (9%) from 20 different areas tested positive for WNV, with none of the animals having been vaccinated against WNV or having travelled outside the country. ELISA detected anti-WNV IgM in 2 of the 12 positive specimens, indicating that some of the infections are relatively recent.

AB  - PURPOSE: The epidemiology, virology, and transmission of West Nile virus (WNV) are reviewed, and the clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of WNV infection are examined. SUMMARY: WNV infection is caused by a flavivirus transmitted from birds to humans through the bite of culicine mosquitoes. WNV was discovered in the blood of a febrile woman from Uganda's West Nile province in 1937. The first case of domestically acquired WNV infection was reported in the United States in 1999 in New York. Since then, WNV infection has spread rapidly across the United States, with 9306 confirmed cases and 210 deaths reported from 45 states in 2003. It is still not clear how WNV was introduced into North America. WNV is a small, single-stranded RNA virus and a member of the Japanese encephalitis virus antigenic complex. While most humans infected with WNV are asymptomatic, some may develop an influenza-like illness. Disease surveillance remains the cornerstone for the early recogn!
 ition and control of WNV. We describe one case of WNV infection with an update on the disease. Strategies for the prevention and control of this infection are reviewed. CONCLUSION: There is no established treatment for WNV infection. Currently, prevention and control are the only measures that help decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with WNV infection. As the number of cases escalates and the geographic distribution of WNV infection widens, the epidemic will continue to pose a major challenge to clinicians in the coming years. There is an urgent need for more research on the pathogenesis and treatment of WNV infection.

AB  - Zoonoses have assumed increasing importance for public health since over 75% of newly emerging diseases that have affected people over two last decades appeared to have zoonotic character. Among factors influencing the emergence of new zoonoses are environmental changes, population migration, urban decay, international travel and trade, globalization of food supplies and changes in food processing, immunosuppression, microbial adaptation and resistance. The epidemics and outbreaks of BSE, SARS, of highly virulent influenza virus infections, West Nile virus encephalitis, Ebola, Nipah, Rift Valley fever, monkeypox, Lyme borreliosis, and foodborne diseases (caused by: Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., enterohaemolytic Escherichia coli, Toxoplasma gondii, Cryptosporidium spp.) have demonstrated the global importance of emerging zoonoses. The rapid distribution of information, careful monitoring and new diagnostic methods should enhance the control measures thus help in !
 public health protection.

SO  - Vector Borne and Zoonotic Diseases. Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., Larchmont, USA: 2005. 5: 2, 137-145. 25 ref. 
AB  - It is hypothesized that previous heterologous flaviviral exposure may modulate clinical illness among persons infected with West Nile virus (WNV). Little is known about the serological response in such persons. In summer 2003, a WNV outbreak occurred in Colorado, the location of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases (DVBID). DVBID employees, most previously vaccinated with yellow fever virus (YFV) or Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) vaccines, were studied to determine whether previous vaccination affected symptom development among those subsequently infected with WNV during the outbreak, as well as their serological response. Serum samples collected in December 2003 and previously banked samples were tested using the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) against WNV, Saint Louis encephalitis virus, dengue- 4 virus, JEV, and YFV. Specimens shown to have WNV antibody by PRNT were tested by IgM and IgG enzymeli!
 nked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Ten (9%) of 113 serosurvey participants had WNV neutralizing antibody titers in December 2003. PRNT titers from previous specimens showed that one of the ten had seroconverted to WNV before 2003. Of the remaining nine participants, seven reported illness in the summer of 2003, two of which were unvaccinated and five previously vaccinated. In the December 2003 specimens, five persons previously unvaccinated or vaccinated only against YFV had a fourfold or greater neutralizing titer with WNV than with other flaviviruses, whereas no persons previously vaccinated against JEV or JEV and YFV showed a similar difference in neutralizing titers. Eight of nine persons infected in 2003 had negative or indeterminate WNV MAC-ELISA results in the December 2003 sample; the ninth person was vaccinated against YFV one month previously, and was also YFV positive by MAC-ELISA. We conclude that previous flaviviral vaccination does not markedly affect the dev!
 elopment of WNV fever and that the IgM antibody response in pa!

SO  - Vector Borne and Zoonotic Diseases. Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., Larchmont, USA: 2005. 5: 2, 181-188. 36 ref. 
AB  - Data from an outbreak (August to October, 2002) of West Nile virus (WNV) encephalomyelitis in a population of horses located in northern Indiana was scanned for clusters in time and space. One significant (p=0.04) cluster of case premises was detected, occurring between September 4 and 10 in the south-west part of the study area (85.70 degrees N, 45.50 degrees W). It included 10 case premises (3.67 case premises expected) within a radius of 2264 m. Image data were acquired by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor onboard a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration polar-orbiting satellite. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was calculated from visible and near-infrared data of daily observations, which were composited to produce a weekly-1 km2 resolution raster image product. During the epidemic, a significant (p<0.01) decrease (0.025 per week) in estimated NDVI was observed at all case and control premise sites. The median es!
 timated NDVI (0.659) for case premises within the cluster identified was significantly (p<0.01) greater than the median estimated NDVI for other case (0.571) and control (0.596) premises during the same period. The difference in median estimated NDVI for case premises within this cluster, compared to cases not included in this cluster, was greatest (5.3% and 5.1%, respectively) at 1 and 5 weeks preceding occurrence of the cluster. The NDVI may be useful for identifying foci of WNV transmission.

AB  - We report West Nile virus (WNV) activity from a new area on Hispaniola, in the vicinity of Monte Cristi National Park in northwest Dominican Republic. Specific anti-WNV antibodies were detected in 12 of 58 (21%) resident birds sampled in March 2003, representing six species in the orders Cuculiformes (cuckoos), Strigiformes (owls), and Passeriformes (song birds). This seroprevalence is the highest reported from any site in the Caribbean Basin. Virus was not detected in any mosquitoes or tissues from bird specimens. Testing of 20 sick or dead birds was negative for WNV. Undetermined flavivirus antibodies were detected in four resident birds at Monte Cristi, as well as in five resident birds at Sierra de Baoruco National Park in southwest Dominican Republic. These data suggest that an unidentified flavivirus, as well as WNV, is active in the Dominican Republic.

SO  - Journal of General Virology. Society for General Microbiology, Reading, UK: 2005. 86: 8, 2175-2183. 50 ref. 
AB  - Intrahost genetic diversity was analysed in naturally infected mosquitoes and birds to determine whether West Nile virus (WNV) exists in nature as a quasispecies and to quantify selective pressures within and between hosts. WNV was sampled from ten infected birds and ten infected mosquito pools collected on Long Island, NY, USA, during the peak of the 2003 WNV transmission season. A 1938 nt fragment comprising the 3' 1159 nt of the WNV envelope (E) coding region and the 5' 779 nt of the non-structural protein 1 (NS1) coding region was amplified and cloned and 20 clones per specimen were sequenced. Results from this analysis demonstrate that WNV infections are derived from a genetically diverse population of genomes in nature. The mean nucleotide diversity was 0.016% within individual specimens and the mean percentage of clones that differed from the consensus sequence was 19.5%. WNV sequences in mosquitoes were significantly more genetically diverse than WNV in birds. !
 No host-dependent bias for particular types of mutations was observed and estimates of genetic diversity did not differ significantly between E and NS1 coding sequences. Non-consensus clones obtained from two avian specimens had highly similar genetic signatures, providing preliminary evidence that WNV genetic diversity may be maintained throughout the enzootic transmission cycle, rather than arising independently during each infection. Evidence of purifying selection was obtained from both intra- and interhost WNV populations. Combined, these data support the observation that WNV populations may be structured as a quasispecies and document strong purifying natural selection in WNV populations.

AB  - Objectives: The objective of this study was to investigate long-term outcomes after West Nile virus infection. Methods: We reviewed the medical records of persons reported with West Nile virus from Tennessee, USA, in 2002 and interviewed cases 1 year after acute illness. Results: In 2002, a total of 56 cases of West Nile virus were reported in Tennessee; 48 (84%) had meningitis or encephalitis. Of those, 9 (19%) died during acute infection and 12 (25%) died within 6 months of illness onset. Patients with West Nile virus neurological illness spent a median of 10 days in the hospital and were unable to resume normal activities for a median of 25 days. One year later, 12 of 22 (55%) persons reported that they were not fully recovered, with symptoms including fatigue, weakness, difficulty ambulating, and memory problems. Conclusions: West Nile virus infection leads to high rates of mortality and substantial persistent morbidity. Prevention efforts should be targeted to pop!

TI  - A mathematical model for assessing control strategies against West Nile virus.
SO  - Bulletin of Mathematical Biology. Elsevier, Amsterdam, Netherlands: 2005. 67: 5, 1107-1133. 46 ref. 
AB  - Since its incursion into North America in 1999, West Nile virus (WNV) has spread rapidly across the continent resulting in numerous human infections and deaths. Owing to the absence of an effective diagnostic test and therapeutic treatment against WNV, public health officials have focused on the use of preventive measures in an attempt to halt the spread of WNV in humans. The aim of this paper is to use mathematical modelling and analysis to assess two main anti-WNV preventive strategies, namely: mosquito reduction strategies and personal protection. We propose a single-season ordinary differential equation model for the transmission dynamics of WNV in a mosquito-bird-human community, with birds as reservoir hosts and culicine mosquitoes as vectors. The model exhibits two equilibria; namely the disease-free equilibrium and a unique endemic equilibrium. Stability analysis of the model shows that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if a certain!
  threshold quantity (R0), which depends solely on parameters associated with the mosquito-bird cycle, is less than unity. The public health implication of this is that WNV can be eradicated from the mosquito-bird cycle (and, consequently, from the human population) if the adopted mosquito reduction strategy (or strategies) can make R0<1. On the other hand, it is shown, using a novel and robust technique that is based on the theory of monotone dynamical systems coupled with a regular perturbation argument and a Liapunov function, that if R>1, then the unique endemic equilibrium is globally stable for small WNV-induced avian mortality. Thus, in this case, WNV persists in the mosquito-bird population.

AB  - Background: West Nile virus first appeared in the United States in 1999 and has since spread throughout the contiguous states, resulting in thousands of cases. By 2002, it was clear that the virus could be transmitted by blood transfusion, and by the middle of 2003, essentially all blood donations were being tested for West Nile virus RNA with the use of investigational nucleic acid amplification tests; testing was performed on individual samples or on "minipools" of up to 16 donations. Methods: We analysed data from the West Nile virus testing programme of the American Red Cross for 2003 and 2004 to identify geographical and temporal trends. In areas with a high incidence of infection, individual donations were tested to increase the sensitivity of testing. Donors with reactive results participated in follow-up studies to confirm the original reactivity and to assess the natural history of infection. Results: Routine testing in 2003 and 2004 identified 540 donations t!
 hat were positive for West Nile virus RNA, of which 362 (67 percent) were IgM antibody-negative and most likely infectious. Of the 540 positive donations, 148 (27%) were detectable only by testing of individual donations, but only 15 of the 148 (10%) were negative for IgM antibody. The overall frequencies of RNA-positive donations during the epidemic periods were 1.49 per 10 000 donations in 2003 and 0.44 per 10 000 in 2004. In 2004, fifty-two percent of the positive donations were from donors in four counties in southern California. Conclusion: Rapid implementation of a nucleic acid amplification test led to the prospective identification of 519 donors who were positive for West Nile virus RNA and the removal of more than 1000 potentially infectious related components from the blood supply of the Red Cross. No cases of transfusion-transmitted infection were confirmed among recipients of the tested blood.

AB  - Background: The use of nucleic acid amplification (NAA) tests of "minipools" of 16 samples to screen blood donors for West Nile virus RNA began in July 2003. We report the yield and characteristics of positive donations and the incremental yield and safety of NAA tests of individual donations. Methods: Reactive minipools were analysed to identify the individual reactive donations. For the regions with the highest yield on minipool testing, retrospective NAA testing was performed on individual donations that were negative on minipool testing. Reactive donations were confirmed by alternative NAA tests and IgM and IgG tests, and donors were followed to document seroconversion. Results: Between 1 July and 31 October 2003, A total of 677 603 donations were prospectively screened for West Nile virus by minipool testing, yielding 183 confirmed viraemic donations (0.027 percent, or 1 in 3703 donations). Retrospective individual testing of 23 088 donations from high-prevalence !
 regions that were negative on minipool testing yielded 30 additional units with a low level of viraemia, with 14 additional viraemic units detected by prospective testing of individual donations late in the 2003 transmission season. Of all the viraemic units detected, 5% were detected only by individual testing and were negative for IgM antibody, 29% were detected by individual testing after IgM seroconversion, and 66% were detected by minipool testing. West Nile virus infection was confirmed in both recipients of IgM-negative units that were reactive on individual testing, whereas neither recipient of antibody-positive blood components that were reactive on individual testing was infected. In 2004, prospective testing of individual donations in regions that yielded donations that were reactive on minipool testing resulted in a 32% incremental yield of units with a low level of viraemia that would have been missed by minipool testing. Conclusions: Although nucleic acid ampl!
 ification testing of minipools of blood donations prevented hu!
 ndreds o
f cases of West Nile virus infection in 2003, it failed to detect units with a low level of viraemia, some of which were antibody-negative and infectious. These data support the use of targeted nucleic acid amplification testing of individual donations in high-prevalence regions, a strategy that was implemented successfully in 2004.

AB  - Objectives: Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) has recently emerged as a major central nervous system complication associated with West Nile virus (WNV) infection. The spectrum of clinical presentations of AFP in WNV infection and its sequelae have not been well-studied. Methods: We describe three patients with AFP due to WNV infection [USA]. Also, we review the clinical presentations of 56 patients with this complication derived from published studies. Results: Patients with AFP and WNV presented with a spectrum of illness ranging from single extremity paralysis to quadriparalysis with cranial nerve involvement. Patients commonly developed respiratory failure (54%) and bladder dysfunction (22%). While fever was nearly universal (92%), signs of meningismus were less common (17%). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis generally revealed a modest pleocytosis, and imaging studies were not diagnostic. Persistent neurological impairment occurred in all survivors; overall mortality !
 rate was high (22%) and was associated with both the extent of paralysis and advanced age. Conclusion: AFP in the setting of WNV is associated with significant mortality and long-term morbidity.

TI  - Comparative analysis of immunoglobulin M (IgM) capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using virus-like particles or virus-infected mouse brain antigens to detect IgM antibody in sera from patients with evident flaviviral infections.
SO  - Journal of Clinical Microbiology. American Society for Microbiology (ASM), Washington, USA: 2005. 43: 7, 3227-3236. 31 ref. 
AB  - The use of immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (MAC-ELISA) serves as a valuable tool for the diagnosis of acute flaviviral infections, since IgM antibody titers are detectable early, peak at about 2 weeks postinfection, and subsequently decline to lower levels over the next few months. Traditionally, virus-infected tissue culture or suckling mouse brain (SMB) has been the source of viral antigens used in the assay. In an effort to provide a reliable source of standardized viral antigens for serodiagnosis of the medically important flaviviruses, we have developed a eukaryotic plasmid vector to express the premembrane/membrane and envelope proteins which self-assemble into noninfectious virus-like particles (VLPs). In addition to the plasmids for Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus (WNV), St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), and dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) reported earlier, we recently constructed the DENV-1, -3, and -4 VLP!
  expression plasmids. Three blind-coded human serum panels were assembled from patients having recent DENV, SLEV, and WNV infections to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the MAC-ELISA using VLPs or SMB antigens. In addition, serum specimens from patients infected with either Powassan virus or La Crosse encephalitis virus were used to evaluate the cross-reactivity of seven mosquito-borne viral antigens. The results of the present studies showed higher sensitivity when using SLEV and WNV VLPs and higher specificity when using SLEV, WNV, and the mixture of DENV-1 to -4 VLPs in the MAC-ELISA than when using corresponding SMB antigens. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, a plot of the sensitivity versus false positive rate (100 - specificity), was applied to discriminate the accuracy of tests comparing the use of VLPs and SMB antigen. The measurement of assay performance by the ROC analysis indicated that there were statistically significant differenc!
 es in assay performance between DENV and WNV VLPs and the resp!
 ective S
MB antigens. Additionally, VLPs had a lower cutoff positive/negative ratio than corresponding SMB antigens when employed for the confirmation of current infections. The VLPs also performed better than SMB antigens in the MAC-ELISA, as indicated by a higher positive prediction value and positive likelihood ratio test. Cell lines continuously secreting these VLPs are therefore a significantly improved source of serodiagnostic antigens compared to the traditional sources of virus-infected tissue culture or suckling mouse brain.

AB  - In January 2003, a 50-year-old woman from Missouri, USA, received a mismatched unrelated bone marrow transplant. One year later, she presented with fatigue, fever and shortness of breath. She had clinical features of cardiac tamponade and became rapidly unstable, requiring intubation and performance of an emergent pericardial window. She developed encephalopathy, seizures and flaccid quadriplegia. An MRI of the brain and cervical spine revealed no abnormalities. However, a lumbar puncture performed revealed an elevated protein level in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Likewise, CSF RT-PCR for West Nile virus (WNV) was positive at 770 copies/ml, as well as for Epstein-Barr virus. Peripheral blood was also tested for WNV. Both WNV IgM ELISA and WNV PCR were positive. Despite therapy with intravenous immunoglobulins and steroids, the patient remained quadriplegic and ventilator-dependent until the time of her hospital discharge. The patient eventually died in January 2005 a!
 fter developing sepsis and disseminated herpes infection.

SO  - Environmental Health Perspectives. Public Health Service, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Research Triangle Park, USA: 2005. 113: 8, 1046-1051. 40 ref. 
AB  - Organophosphate pesticides are a major source of occupational exposure in the United States. Moreover, malathion has been sprayed over major urban populations in an effort to control mosquitoes carrying West Nile virus. Previous research, reviewed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, on the genotoxicity and carcinogenicity of malathion has been inconclusive, although malathion is a known endocrine disruptor. Here, interindividual variations and commonality of gene expression signatures have been studied in normal human mammary epithelial cells from four women undergoing reduction mammoplasty. The cell strains were obtained from the discarded tissues through the Cooperative Human Tissue Network (sponsors: National Cancer Institute and National Disease Research Interchange). Interindividual variation of gene expression patterns in response to malathion was observed in various clustering patterns for the four cell strains. Further clustering identified three genes!
  with increased expression after treatment in all four cell strains. These genes were two aldo-keto reductases (AKR1C1 and AKR1C2) and an estrogen-responsive gene (EBBP). Decreased expression of six RNA species was seen at various time points in all cell strains analyzed: plasminogen activator (PLAT), centromere protein F (CPF), replication factor C (RFC3), thymidylate synthetase (TYMS), a putative mitotic checkpoint kinase (BUB1), and a gene of unknown function (GenBank accession no. AI859865). Expression changes in all these genes, detected by DNA microarrays, have been verified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Differential changes in expression of these genes may yield biomarkers that provide insight into interindividual variation in malathion toxicity.

AB  - Between 1937 and 1999, West Nile virus (WNV) garnered scant medical attention as the cause of febrile illness and sporadic encephalitis in parts of Africa, Asia and Europe. After the surprising detection of WNV in New York City in 1999, the virus has spread dramatically westward across the USA, southward into Central America and the Caribbean, and northward into Canada, resulting in the largest epidemics of neuroinvasive WNV disease ever reported. During 1999-2004, >7000 neuroinvasive WNV disease cases were reported in the USA. In 2002, WNV transmission through blood transfusion and organ transplantation was described for the first time, intrauterine transmission was first documented, and possible transmission through breastfeeding was reported. This review highlights new information regarding the epidemiology and dynamics of WNV transmission, providing a new platform for further research into preventing and controlling WNV disease.

SO  - Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Hagerstown, USA: 2005. 18: 4, 337-341. 
AB  - Purpose of review: Transplant patients are uniquely predisposed to emerging infections for a number of reasons. Two outbreaks, West Nile virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome, have recently provided important lessons on how transplant patients are affected, and how transplant programmes must adapt and evolve in the face of emerging infections. An update of emerging infections in transplant patients, using West Nile virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome as specific examples, is summarized here. Recent findings: Exogenous immunosuppression, specific allograft factors, and extensive contact with the healthcare system all predispose transplant patients to emerging infections. Transplant patients may acquire West Nile virus through blood transfusion, donor transmission, or community exposure. Seroprevalence data in transplant populations suggest the risk of severe neurological disease is several fold higher in transplant recipients who acquire West Nile virus co!
 mpared with immunocompetent individuals. Prevention strategies are critical in this population. These include nucleic acid testing of blood products and potentially also screening organ donors in a similar manner. During the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, transplant patients with severe and rapidly progressive disease were reported. Higher viral burdens appeared to be present in transplant patients and may have implications for the increased infectivity of these patients. Transplant programmes in severe acute respiratory syndrome areas were also adversely affected because of donor concerns, recipient issues and resource problems. Summary: Transplant patients are uniquely predisposed to emerging infections. Lessons learned from West Nile virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome in transplantation should be applicable to future outbreaks of other emerging infectious diseases.

SO  - Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association. American Mosquito Control Association, Inc., Eatontown, USA: 2005. 21: 2, 194-200. 22 ref. 
AB  - Paucity of data on host-feeding patterns and behaviour of 43 mosquito species that are reported as suspected West Nile virus (WN) vectors has limited full evaluation of their vectorial capacity. Recent studies addressing this issue need additional confirmation and should also be expanded to include collections of species or subpopulations attracted to humans. We used 4 types of collection methods to collect mosquitoes, including omnidirectional Fay-Prince traps, Centers for Disease Control-type light traps, gravid traps, and human-landing collections. Mosquitoes were collected during 2 full WN transmission seasons in 2001 and 2002, at 9 different sites across Delaware. We collected from various habitats, including salt marshes, brackish water areas, woodlands, a tire dump, a racetrack, and a mushroom farm. Blood-meal analyses were performed on parous mosquitoes by using a sandwich-type enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We tested primarily for 5 common host species, in!
 cluding rabbits, dogs, deer, horses, and chickens. We obtained substantial host-feeding data from 8 mosquito species. The most mammalophilic species were Anopheles quadrimaculatus, Coquillettidia perturbans, and Aedes albopictus, whereas the most ornithophilic species was Culex pipiens. Aedes albopictus was the most anthropophilic species, whereas Ae. vexans and Cq. perturbans exhibited relatively low attraction to humans. Culex salinarius was the species with the most diverse host-feeding activity. Based on feeding behaviour, Cx. pipiens and Cx. salinarius appear to be the most likely bridge vectors. Other species may have opportunities to be bridge vectors under special circumstances, as discussed in the paper.

SO  - Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association. American Mosquito Control Association, Inc., Eatontown, USA: 2005. 21: 2, 225-226. 14 ref. 
AB  - A single adult female of Anopheles (Anopheles) punctipennis (Say) was collected in a New Jersey light trap in the port area of Honolulu, Oahu, Hawaii, USA, on December 8, 2003. This is the 1st record of a wild-collected, intact Anopheles mosquito, and the 1st detection of An. punctipennis in the Hawaiian Islands. Extensive larval surveillance and additional light trapping in the area of the collection site indicate that populations of this species have not become established on Oahu. The distribution of An. punctipennis largely coincides with the distribution of West Nile virus (WNV) in North America. Although An. punctipennis is not an important vector of WNV, Culex quinquefasciatus and Cx. tarsalis are important vectors of WNV and occur in areas of North America with active WNV transmission. Culex quinquefasciatus is established in Hawaii, and Cx. tarsalis has been detected on multiple occasions by quarantine. Increased quarantine inspections, disinsection of airline!
  cargo holds, enhanced vector surveillance, and the development of sanitary corridors around airports and port facilities are necessary to reduce the introduction of vectors and pathogens.

AB  - The pathogen causative of West Nile fever/encephalitis is primarily indigenous to Africa and the Middle and Near East. It burst into New York in 1999 and spread over the North American continent. The virus is maintained between avian hosts and mosquitoes. Humans contract the infection usually as a result of mosquito bites. The infection is inapparent in approximately 80% of affected individuals, while the remaining 20% or so develop West Nile fever with principal symptoms of pyrexia, headache, myalgia, rash and lymphadenopathy. The incubation period is 3-14 days, and usually the patient recovers in a period from several days to one week. About 0.7% of all infected individuals develop central nervous system (CNS) symptoms called West Nile encephalitis/meningitis. Most of such patients are elderly and suffer from a severe headache, nuchal stiffness, muscle weakness, disturbance of consciousness, and convulsions, with a mortality as high as 3%-15%. The diagnosis is establ!
 ished by viral isolation, detection of viral RNA genome with the RT-PCR technique, and demonstration of serum antibody. The only therapy available is symptomatic treatment. Vaccines are under investigation for development. In epidemic areas, care should be exercised to avoid mosquito bites and an insect repellent must be used. This disease is classified in Category 4 infections under the infectious disease control law in Japan.

SO  - Journal of Molecular Modeling. Springer-Verlag GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany: 2005. 11: 3, 248-255. 
AB  - Knowledge-based modeling has proved significantly accurate for generating the quality models for proteins whose sequence identity with the structurally known targets is greater than or equal to 40%. On the other hand, models obtained for low sequence identities are not reliable. Hence, a reliable and alternative strategy that uses knowledge of domains in the protein can be used to improve the quality of the model generated by the homology method. Here, we report a method for developing a 3D-model for the envelope glycoprotein (Egp) of west nile virus (WNV), using knowledge of structurally conserved functional domains amongst the target sequence (Egp of WNV) and its homologous templates belonging to the same protein family, flaviviridae. This strategy is found to be highly effective in reducing the root mean square deviation (RMSD) value at the C alpha positions of the target and its experimental homologues. The 3D structure of a protein is a prerequisite for structure-!
 based drug design as well as for identifying the conformational epitopes that are essential for the designing vaccines. The conformational epitopes are mapped from the 3D structure of Egp of WNV modeled using the concept of an antigenic domain. A total of five such epitope regions/sites have been identified. They have been found distributed in the loop regions (surface) of the whole protein model composed of dimerization, central and immunological domains. These sites are proposed as the binding sites for HLA proteins/B-cell receptors. Binding is required to activate the immune response against WNV.

AB  - Following an outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in south-eastern Mauritania during 1998, entomological investigations were conducted for 2 years in the affected parts of Senegal and Mauritania, spanning the Senegal River basin. A total of 92 787 mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae), belonging to 10 genera and 41 species, were captured in light traps. In Senegal, Culex poicilipes (41%) and Mansonia uniformis (39%) were the most abundant species caught, whereas Aedes vexans (77%) and Cx. poicilipes (15%) predominated in Mauritania. RVF virus was isolated from 63 pools of Cx. poicilipes: 36 from Senegal in 1998 and 27 from Mauritania in 1999. These results are the first field evidence of Cx. poicilipes naturally infected with RVFV, and the first isolations of this virus from mosquitoes in Mauritania - the main West African epidemic and epizootic area. Additional arbovirus isolates comprised 25 strains of Bagaza (BAG) from Aedes fowleri, Culex neavei and Cx. poicilipes; 67 San!
 ar (ArD 66707) from Cx. poicilipes; 51 Wesselsbron (WSL) from Ae. vexans and 30 strains of West Nile (WN) from Ma. uniformis, showing differential specific virus-vector associations in the circulation activity of these five arboviruses.

AB  - A study was conducted to understand the basis for the prevalence of serum antibodies to West Nile virus (WNV) and to investigate the immuno-cross reaction between WNV and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in populations [China]. 347 adult serum specimens were collected from recruits. The immunoglobulin G antibodies to WNV were determined by means of indirect immunofluorescence assay. The results showed that the prevalence rates of serum antibody to WNV and JEV were 3.2% and 5.7%, respectively. Of the 244 specimens in which examinations were performed simultaneously for both WNV and JEV, three were positive for both antibodies. The percentages of positive samples for WNV and JEV were 60% and 21%, respectively. It is concluded that less immunity against WNV exists in the populations examined and the value of cross immunity with JEV antibodies to WNV may be limited.

AB  - During the last 35 years, two major outbreaks of Akabane virus (AKAV) infection were recorded in cattle in Israel in 1969/1970 and 2002/2003. Congenital malformations of calves characterised by the appearance of an arthrogryposis and hydranencephaly syndrome first appeared in Israel in 1969. Based on epidemiological, clinical, pathological, histopathological and serological data, this syndrome was strongly correlated with seroreactivity to AKAV, a member of the Bunyaviridae, Simbu serogroup. In February 2002, the first cases of 'blind newborn calves' (BNC) were observed on farms located in the northern valleys of Israel. Microtitre serum neutralisation (SN) tests of serum from malformed calves and their dams were conducted using Akabane and Aino viruses (AINOV). The first SN test was performed at the reference laboratory of the Clinical Virology Section, Kyushu Research Station, National Institute of Animal Health, Kagoshima, Japan. The clear-cut findings of seroreacti!
 vity to AKAV by cattle located in the affected zone, in contrast to negative findings in cattle from unaffected farms (87% and 3.7%, respectively) was indicative of AKAV infection. In contrast, seroreactivity to Aino virus was relatively low in both affected and non-affected areas during the 2002 outbreak. In order to establish Israeli laboratory standards for Simbu serogroup diagnosis, 57 serum samples tested by the Japanese laboratory were retested by SN in Israel. An almost complete homology (96.5%) was found between the two SN panels of sera (kappa=0.92). SN and ELISA kits enabled the surveillance of this arbovirus epidemic in the second consecutive year (2003). Moreover, AKAV was identified in trapped midges by hemi-nested PCR and real-time PCR. With these techniques, the geographical limits of the BNC epidemic that appeared in some areas of Israel was identified for the first time and was recorded in the Arava Rift Valley, 400 km south of the epicentre of the 2002 out!
 break. The reintroduction of AKAV into this region, together w!
 ith some
 evidence of AINOV activity and epidemics of bluetongue (BT) in the southern parts of Europe and the eastern Mediterranean, and renewed outbreaks of West Nile virus infection in Israel, Italy and southern France, are all evidence of the potential spread of arbovirus activity into southern Europe from the Mediterranean Basin.

SO  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. National Academy of Sciences, Washington, USA: 2005. 102: 25, 8871-8874. 37 ref. 
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is now the predominant circulating arthropod-borne virus in the United States with >15,000 human cases and >600 fatalities since 1999. Conventionally, mosquitoes become infected when feeding on viremic birds and subsequently transmit the virus to susceptible hosts. Here, we demonstrate nonviremic transmission of WNV between cofeeding mosquitoes. Donor, Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus mosquitoes infected with WNV were fed simultaneously with uninfected "recipient" mosquitoes on naive mice. At all times, donor and recipient mosquitoes were housed in separate sealed containers, precluding the possibility of mixing. Recipients became infected in all five trials, with infection rates as high as 5.8% and no detectable viremia in the hosts. Remarkably, a 2.3% infection rate was observed when 87 uninfected mosquitoes fed adjacent to a single infected mosquito. This phenomenon could potentially enhance virus survival, transmission, and dispersion and obviat!
 e the requirement for viremia. All vertebrates, including immune and insusceptible animals, might therefore facilitate mosquito infection. Our findings question the status of dead-end hosts in the WNV transmission cycle and may partly explain the success with which WNV established and rapidly dispersed throughout North America.

SO  - Antiviral Research. Elsevier, Amsterdam, Netherlands: 2005. 67: 1, 38-45. 34 ref. 
AB  - Ribavirin has been reported to cause error-prone replication and viral extinction in RNA viruses. The antiviral activity of ribavirin against West Nile virus (WNV) was evaluated in various cell lines to select a model in which mutagenic effects could be studied. The antiviral activity was greatest in HeLa cells as compared to CV-1, L929, Vero, or MA-104 cells. WNV was also passaged sequentially in cell monolayers treated with ribavirin to determine whether cumulative mutations could lead to viral extinction in these cell lines. The virus was abrogated in HeLa cells after 4 passages, while high viral titers persisted after many passages in other cells. A molecular clone of WNV was propagated in HeLa cells treated with 15 micro g/mL ribavirin, and sequencing of viral genome segments revealed significant increases in transition mutations, demonstrating that ribavirin induced error-prone replication. The relative infectivity of viral RNA synthesized in the presence of riba!
 virin was shown to be reduced compared with untreated controls. These data support the hypothesis that error catastrophe is one of the modes of action for ribavirin against WNV.

AB  - An urgent need exists for new agents to control mosquito vectors of disease. Mosquito larvicides based on the bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis (Bti) or B. sphaericus (Bs) are effective in many habitats, but use is limited by their high cost. Moreover, mosquito resistance evolves rapidly to Bs where it is used intensively. The efficacy of these bacteria is due to a binary protein (BsB) in Bs and four proteins (Cry4A, Cry4B, Cry11A, and Cyt1A) in Bti. Here we report the use of cyt1A promoters and a 5' mRNA stabilizing sequence to synthesize high levels of Bs2362 binary toxin in Bti strains. The recombinant BtiIPS-82/BsB showed high potency against fourth instars of Culex quinquefasciatus, a vector of West Nile virus, being 21-fold as potent as BtiIPS-82, and 32-fold as potent as Bs2362. Similar improved efficacy was obtained against larvae of C. tarsalis. Moreover, BtiIPS-82/BsB suppressed resistance to Bs2362 in C. quinquefasciatus.

AB  - In 2002, the world's largest outbreak of neuroinvasive West Nile virus (WNV) disease occurred. Illinois reported 21% of the total cases in the United States, the most among all states. The epidemiology of WNV in Illinois in 2002 was examined to determine factors associated with severe disease and death. A total of 884 cases were identified and there were 66 deaths. The overall attack rate of WNV infection was 7.1 per 100 000 population and this increased with age. The median ages of patients and patients who died were 56 and 78 years, respectively. Among patients who died, 91% were diagnosed with encephalitis and the case-fatality rate for patients with encephalitis was 18.6%. Patients more than 50 years old had a significantly higher risk of being reported with encephalitis (relative risk (RR)=3.3, 95% confidence interval (CI)=2.6-4.3%) and death (RR=22.3, 95% CI=5.5-90.4%). Clinicians evaluating elderly patients with WNV infection should assess patients closely for p!

AB  - 38 patients infected with West Nile virus (WNV) and who were WNV IgM-positive during the autumn of 2003 in Alberta, Canada, were followed up in 2004. A total of 39 serum samples were collected from these patients and tested for IgM and IgG antibodies to WNV using commercial assays from 2 companies (Focus Technologies, Cypress, California, USA, and Panbio, Windsor, Queensland, Australia). The serum samples were also tested for haemagglutination-inhibiting (HI) antibodies to WNV. Of the 39 serum samples tested, 28 were positive, 5 were indeterminate and 6 were negative with the Focus IgM kit. Using the Panbio IgM kit, 21 serum samples were positive, 3 were indeterminate and 14 were negative. All had WNV IgG antibodies detected by Focus and Panbio IgG kits. HI antibodies were detected in all patients. These data show that when tests are conducted with newly available kits, IgM antibody to WNV persists for ?8 months in most patients.

AB  - A prospective, population-based study was conducted to describe the clinical features, mechanisms and short-term outcomes of West Nile virus (WNV)-associated flaccid paralysis among residents of Boulder, Larimer and Weld counties in Colorado, USA. 32 patients (18 males and 14 females; aged 15-84 years) with developing paralysis and acute WNV infection were identified during the summer and fall of 2003. Of these patients, 27 (84%) had asymmetric weakness consistent with poliomyelitis-like syndrome, 4 (13%) had symmetric ascending weakness with sensory abnormalities consistent with the acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy form of Guillain-Barre syndrome, and one had brachial plexus neuropathy. The incidence of poliomyelitis-like syndrome was 3.7/100 000. Twelve patients (38%), including one with Guillain-Barre-like syndrome, had acute respiratory failure that required endotracheal intubation. At 4 months, 3 patients with respiratory failure died, 2 rem!
 ained intubated, 25 showed various degrees of improvement, and 2 were lost to follow-up. It is suggested that a poliomyelitis-like syndrome likely involving spinal anterior horn cells is the most common mechanism of WNV-associated paralysis and is associated with significant short- and long-term illness and death.

AB  - An extensive surveillance for West Nile virus (WNV) infection in equines and chickens in Guadeloupe, during 2003-2004, was conducted. Of the 487 equines (437 horses, 34 donkeys and 16 ponies) sampled in July 2003, 94 (19.3%) had antibodies to WNV. In August 2004, of 431 equines (386 horses, 27 donkeys and 18 ponies), 70 had antibodies to WNV. Most WNV-seropositive equines were located in evergreen forests characterized by a low altitude and intensive farming of sugarcane in the vicinity of mangroves, back mangroves and swamps. Among chickens, 11 (1.7%) of 656 samples in July 2003 and 5 (0.6%) of 801 samples in July 2004 had antibodies to WNV. All seropositive chickens were on the main island of the country. No human or equine clinical cases were observed, however abnormal death and paralysis was observed in a chicken seropositive for WNV.

SO  - British Journal of Dermatology. Blackwell Publishing, Oxford, UK: 2005. 152: 6, 1263-1267. 26 ref. 
AB  - Background: Insect repellents and sunscreens are over-the-counter products extensively used by the general public. Concurrent application of these products has become widespread in many regions across North America, because of concerns about West Nile virus and skin cancers. Objectives: We investigated whether formulation type, application amount, and sequence would affect the percutaneous absorption profiles of the active repellent and sunscreen ingredients. Methods: In vitro percutaneous permeation of the repellent N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) and the sunscreen oxybenzone from concurrent application of five commercially available products (A, repellent spray; B, repellent lotion; C, sunscreen lotion; D and E, combined repellent/sunscreen lotions) was measured and compared using Franz-style diffusion cells with piglet skin at 37 degrees C. Results: Penetration of DEET in A and B increased by 1640% and 282%, respectively, when C was applied concurrently. Penetration !
 of DEET in D and E was 53% and 79% higher than that in B. Permeation of DEET from A+C (2:1) and A+C (1:2) increased by 530% and 278%, respectively. Permeation of oxybenzone was 189% and 280% higher in A+C and B+C than in C. Permeation of oxybenzone in D and E was also 221% and 296% higher than that in C. Permeation of oxybenzone was 196% greater when A was applied on top of C than when C was applied on top of A, while oxybenzone in A+C (1:2) permeated 171% more than that in A+C (2:1). Conclusions: Concurrent application of commercially available repellent and sunscreen products resulted in significant synergistic percutaneous permeation of the repellent DEET and the sunscreen oxybenzone in vitro. The percutaneous penetration profiles were dependent upon the type of formulation, application sequence and application proportion.

AB  - Young adult and weanling pigs were challenged with the New York 99 strain of West Nile virus through the bite of infected mosquitoes. Each of six adult pigs seroconverted, but virus was isolated from serum of only one pig following challenge. Three of five weanling pigs developed viremia, with peak titers of 101.9 and 103.1 PFU/mL. Clinical signs attributable to West Nile virus infection were not observed in any of these animals. An additional four pigs were challenged by feeding West Nile virus-infected mice, and none of the four developed a detectable viremia or seroconverted. These results suggest that pigs are unlikely to play a significant role as amplifying hosts of West Nile virus.

SO  - Journal of Medical Entomology. Entomological Society of America, Lanham, USA: 2005. 42: 3, 301-305. 25 ref. 
AB  - In an effort to determine whether female C. pipiens and C. restuans mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) are attracted to crow, Corvus brachyrhynchus, uropygial gland secretions, CDC miniature light traps (baited with CO2 but with the lights removed) were placed at ~1.5- and 5-m elevations, in 10 trees in a woodlot near Niagara Falls, Canada. These traps were assigned either a bird odour or a blank control. Bird odours were created by attaching cotton swabs coated with crow uropygial gland secretions to the trap intake. A significantly greater number of C. pipiens/restuans were found in the 5-m traps compared with 1.5-m traps, with a significant number attracted to the bird odour over the no odour traps at the 5-m elevation, but not at 1.5 m. We also found more Aedes vexans in the 1.5-m traps than the 5-m traps; however, presence or absence of bird odour did not influence the distribution of A. vexans.

TI  - Avian host and mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) vector competence determine the efficiency of West Nile and St. Louis encephalitis virus transmission.
SO  - Journal of Medical Entomology. Entomological Society of America, Lanham, USA: 2005. 42: 3, 367-375. 41 ref. 
AB  - The ability of the invading NY99 strain of West Nile virus (WNV) to elicit an elevated viraemia response in California passerine birds was critical for the effective infection of Culex mosquitoes. Of the bird species tested, Western scrub jays, Aphelocoma coerulescens, produced the highest viraemia response, followed by house finches, Carpodacus mexicanus, and house sparrows, Passer domesticus. Most likely, few mourning, Zenaidura macroura, or common ground, Columbina passerine, doves and no California quail, Callipepla californica, or chickens would infect blood-feeding Culex mosquitoes. All Western scrub jays and most house finches succumbed to infection. All avian hosts produced a lower viraemia response and survived after infection with an endemic strain of St. Louis encephalitis virus. Culex species varied in their susceptibility to infection with both viruses, with Culex stigmatosoma generally most susceptible, followed by C. tarsalis, and then C. quinquefasciatu!
 s. Populations within Culex species varied markedly in their susceptibility, perhaps contributing to the focality of WNV amplification. Transmitting female C. tarsalis expectorated from six to 3777 plaque-forming units (PFU) of WNV during transmission trials, thereby exposing avian hosts to a wide range of infectious doses. Highly susceptible house finches and moderately susceptible mourning doves were infected by subcutaneous inoculation with decreasing concentrations of WNV ranging from 15 800 to <0.3 PFU. All birds became infected and produced comparable peak viraemias on days 2-3 postinoculation; however, the rise in viraemia titre and onset of the acute phase of infection occurred earliest in birds inoculated with the highest doses. WNV virulence in birds seemed critical in establishing elevated viraemias necessary to efficiently infect blood-feeding Culex mosquitoes.

SO  - Journal of Medical Entomology. Entomological Society of America, Lanham, USA: 2005. 42: 3, 429-444. 40 ref. 
AB  - The ultrastructural features of West Nile virus (WNV) replication and dissemination in orally infected C. pipiens quinquefasciatus were analysed over a 25-day infection period. To investigate the effects of virus replication on membrane induction, cellular organization, and cell viability in midgut and salivary gland tissues, midguts were dissected on days 3, 7, 14 and 21, and salivary glands were collected on days 7, 14, 21 and 25 postinfection (d.p.i.) for examination by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Whole mosquito heads were embedded for TEM analysis 14 d.p.i. to localize WNV particles and to investigate the effects of replication on nervous tissues of the brain. Membrane proliferation was induced by WNV in the midgut epithelium, midgut muscles, and salivary glands, although extensive endoplasmic reticulum swelling was a unique feature of salivary gland infection. TEM revealed WNV-induced pathology in salivary glands at 14, 21 and 25 d.p.i., and we hypothe!
 size that long-term virus infection of this tissue results in severe cellular degeneration and apoptotic-like cell death. This finding indicates that the efficiency of WNV transmission may decrease with mosquito age postinfection.

AB  - In total, 1324 C. pipiens pipiens female mosquitoes were collected at Ft. Hancock, Monmouth County, New Jersey, USA, during January-March of 2001, 2002 and 2003. Mosquitoes were held in an insectary at 27 degrees C and a photoperiod of 16:8 (L:D) h for 6 to 21 days after which they were tested in 34 pools. West Nile viral RNA was detected in one pool by a TaqMan reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay; however, infectious virus could not be isolated using either Vero cell plaque assay or C6/36 mosquito cells. 20 females dissected during January and March 2003 confirmed ovarian diapause status. We suggest that the mode of infection in this pool of overwintering females may have been due to vertical (transgenerational) transmission.

AB  - Usutu virus, a flavivirus first isolated from mosquitoes in South Africa in 1959, caused the death of many blackbirds in Austria in the summers of 2001, 2002 and 2003; some other birds were also affected. Histological findings were multiorgan necrotic foci and encephelitis. This virus has also been identified by a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in 2 human patients in Austria with a skin rash. The clinical aspects, diagnosis and therapy of the infections in man is described. The epidemiology of the infection is compared with that of West Nile virus in the USA.

SO  - Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry. American Chemical Society, Washington, USA: 2005. 53: 9, 3306-3312. 
AB  - The invasion and subsequent spread of the mosquito-borne West Nile virus in the United States has resulted in increased use of methoprene. With the increased need for sensitive detection and monitoring of methoprene in the environment, an analytical LC/ESI-MS/MS method has been developed for the analysis of methoprene and two analogues, kinoprene and hydroprene, in water. To improve the ionization efficiency of the nonpolar analytes, a derivatization step with the Cookson-type reagent 4-phenyl-1,2,4-triazoline-3,5-dione (PTAD) was used. Derivatization improved the limit of detection 100-fold. For tandem MS analyses, limits of detection in environmental water samples (S/N=3) are about 6 pg/mL for methoprene and 20 pg/mL for kinoprene and hydroprene, resulting in limits of quantification (S/N=10) of 20 pg/mL for methoprene and 60 pg/mL for hydroprene and kinoprene extracted from 10 mL of water. This method was applied to measure methoprene concentrations in water samples!

TI  - Performance of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays using a West Nile virus recombinant antigen (preM/E) for detection of West Nile virus- and other flavivirus-specific antibodies.
SO  - Journal of Clinical Microbiology. American Society for Microbiology (ASM), Washington, USA: 2004. 42: 10, 4641-4648. 1 ref. 
AB  - Focus Technologies developed an indirect immunoglobulin G (IgG) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a mu-capture IgM ELISA for the detection of West Nile virus (WNV)-specific antibodies based on a WNV preM/E protein recombinant antigen. Normal and disease state serum panels were used to assess the performance characteristics of the two WNV ELISA kits. Totals of 807 and 1,423 sera were used to assess the IgG ELISA and IgM ELISA kits, respectively. The Focus Technologies IgG ELISA had a sensitivity of 97.6% and a specificity of 92.1% (excluding non-WNV flavivirus sera). The comparative method for WNV IgG may lack sensitivity in detecting IgG in early WNV infection, so the specificity of the Focus IgG ELISA may be higher than 92.1%. When sera from patients either infected with or vaccinated against other flaviviruses were tested on the WNV IgG assay, 35% of the sera reacted as positive for WNV IgG. Yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis vaccinees were less react!
 ive in the IgG ELISA than St. Louis and dengue fever patients. The Focus Technologies IgM ELISA had a sensitivity and a specificity of 99.3% (excluding the non-WNV flavivirus sera). The overall cross-reactivity for the IgM ELISA to flavivirus sera was 12%, with 31% of St. Louis encephalitis patients found to be WNV IgM positive and no yellow fever vaccinees found to be WNV IgM positive. In a selected population of 706 sera, 15 false-positive WNV IgM sera were identified. The use of a background subtraction method for the IgM ELISA eliminated all 15 false-positive results, giving a specificity of 100% for the Focus IgM ELISA.

AB  - Proper surveillance of virus activity and a timely response to viral outbreaks depend upon the rapid diagnosis of viral infections. The immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (MAC-ELISA) is a fast, sensitive test routinely used for the diagnosis of the medically important West Nile and St. Louis encephalitis flaviviruses. However, the suckling mouse brain-derived (SMB) antigen used in this assay is tedious to prepare and has a risk of exposing personnel to live virus and hazardous chemicals. We report the development of a St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) noninfectious recombinant antigen that is a safe and easily produced alternative antigen for use in diagnostic assays. The expression plasmid pCB8SJ2, containing the premembrane and envelope structural protein-encoding regions of SLEV, was constructed to express secreted extracellular virus-like particles (VLPs) from CHO cells. Blind-coded human serum panels were assembled from pat!
 ients having recent SLEV, West Nile virus (WNV), Powassan virus, or La Crosse encephalitis virus infections to assess the sensitivity and specificity of assays with SLEV VLP or SMB antigen. MAC-ELISAs with either antigen had comparable sensitivity for the detection of IgM antibodies against SLEV. Importantly, when these two antigens were tested against a human serum panel from patients having recent WNV or Powassan virus infections, the SLEV VLPs were less likely than SMB antigen to detect flavivirus cross-reactive IgM antibodies. An optimized IgG antibody capture ELISA (GAC-ELISA) with both WNV and SLEV VLPs was developed to circumvent the frequently observed higher background in the antigen-capture IgG-ELISA (ACG-ELISA). For the detection of IgG antibodies against WNV, the GAC-ELISA resulted in a statistically significant higher performance accuracy (P=0.003) than the ACG-ELISA when the WNV VLP antigen was used in both assays. However, no statistical difference was observ!
 ed in the assay performance of the GAC-ELISA with SLEV VLP or !
 the ACG-
ELISA with SLEV SMB antigen.

SO  - Parasite. PRINCEPS Editions, Issy-les-Moulineaux, France: 2005. 12: 2, 99-109. many ref. 
AB  - Among transmissible diseases, vectorial diseases represent a major problem for public health. In the group of acarina, while ticks are the most commonly implicated vectors, other arthropods and notably Dermanyssoidea are also involved in the transmission of pathogenic agents. Since the role of this superfamily is at present largely unknown, we have reviewed the vectorial role of these mites in the appearance, survival and propagation of pathogens. Various authors have shown that Dermanyssoidea are implicated in the transmission of both bacteria (Salmonella, Spirocheta, Rickettsia or Pasteurella) and viruses (equine encephalitis viruses, West Nile virus, Fowl pox virus, the virus causing Newcastle disease and tickborne encephalitis viruses or hantaviruses). Finally, some authors have also shown their role in the transmission of some protozoa and filaria. As the vectorial character of such mites has been more clearly demonstrated (Dermanyssus gallinae, Ornithonyssus baco!
 ti and Allodermanyssus sanguineus), it would be interesting to continue studies to better understand the role of this superfamily in the epidemiology of certain zoonoses.

AB  - The safety and efficacy of a canarypox vector expressing PrM and E genes of West Nile virus (WNV) (ALVAC-WNV) was evaluated in dogs and cats. One group of 17 dogs (vaccinated with 105.6 TCID50) and two groups of cats (groups 1 [n=14] vaccinated with 107.5 TCID50 and 2 [n=8] 105.6 TCID50) were vaccinated twice at 28-day intervals. Fifteen dogs and eleven cats served as negative controls. The cats and dogs were challenged 120 and 135 days after the second immunization, respectively via the bites of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes infected with WNV. The first dose of vaccine induced a detectable antibody response in four dogs and five cats (one immunized with low and four with high doses). After the second dose, all the vaccinated dogs and all of the cats, immunized with high dose had detectable antibody titers, whereas only four of eight cats in the low dose group were seropositive. None of the vaccinated dogs and one vaccinated cat developed viraemia following the WNV mosqu!
 ito-challenge. In contrast, 14 of the 15 control dogs and 9 of the 11 control cats developed viraemia. The experimental vaccine described in this study may be of value in the prevention of WNV infection in dogs and cats.

AB  - West Nile (WN) virus is a flavivirus that first appeared in North America in 1999. Since then, >600 human deaths and 22 000 equine infections have been attributed to the virus in the United States. We expressed a truncated form of WN virus envelope (E) protein in Drosophila S2 cells. This soluble recombinant E protein was recognized by antibodies from naturally infected horses, indicating that it contains native epitopes. Mice and horses produced high-titre antibodies when immunized with recombinant E protein combined with aluminium hydroxide. Immunized mice were resistant to challenge with a lethal viral dose. Sera from immunized horses, administered to naive mice, conferred resistance against a lethal WN viral challenge. In addition, sera of immunized horses neutralized West Nile virus in vitro, as demonstrated by plaque reduction assays. This recombinant form of E protein, combined with aluminium hydroxide, is a candidate vaccine that may protect humans and horses a!
 gainst WN virus infections.

AB  - Infection with West Nile virus (WNV) ranges from causing no symptoms to causing non-specific fever, meningitis, meningo-encephalitis and death. Advanced age and immunosuppression are the greatest risk factors for the development of encephalitis or other neurological manifestations of WNV. We report the first fatal case of primary WNV infection in an orthotopic heart transplant recipient from North Carolina, USA. We reviewed the literature on WNV infection in the general population and in immunocompromised hosts. As WNV becomes more common in the United States, it will become an increasing threat to our transplant population.

TI  - Polioencephalomyelitis: a case report.
SO  - Pig Journal. Pig Veterinary Society, Chippenham, UK: 2005. 55: 167-175. 8 ref. 
AB  - A case report of a non-suppurative encephalitis in a group of pigs is described. These initially had a fore limb lameness that progressed to a hind limb lameness with paralysis. There were no gross lesions and histopathological lesions were restricted to the brain. In the absence of clinical signs and gross or histological lesions of the major epizootics, other potential causes were examined. Diseases not seen in the UK (EMCV, Blue-eye, West Nile virus) were ruled out. The occurrence of the disease in a group of pigs too old to be infected with HEV suggested that the most likely cause of the condition was porcine enterovirus. These are now divided by genetic analysis into three groups (PTV, PEV-A and PEV-B) of which the first is Teschovirus.

SO  - Journal of Infectious Diseases. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, USA: 2005. 191: 7, 1148-1154. 47 ref. 
AB  - West Nile virus causes fatal encephalitis in humans, mice, and other vertebrates. In the present study, we demonstrate that small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) inhibit West Nile virus replication in vitro. Moreover, the administration of siRNAs to mice by hydrodynamic injection 24 h before challenge with an intraperitoneal inoculum of West Nile virus reduced the viral load and afforded partial protection from lethal infection. These data show the efficacy of the prophylactic use of siRNAs against a viral infection in vivo and suggest new strategies to combat West Nile virus.

TI  - Development of a humanized monoclonal antibody with therapeutic potential against West Nile virus.
SO  - Nature Medicine. Nature Publishing Group, London, UK: 2005. 11: 5, 522-530. 47 ref. 
AB  - Neutralization of West Nile virus (WNV) in vivo correlates with the development of an antibody response against the viral envelope (E) protein. Using random mutagenesis and yeast surface display, we defined individual contact residues of 14 newly generated monoclonal antibodies against domain III of the WNV E protein. Monoclonal antibodies that strongly neutralized WNV localized to a surface patch on the lateral face of domain III. Convalescent antibodies from individuals who had recovered from WNV infection also detected this epitope. One monoclonal antibody, E16, neutralized 10 different strains in vitro, and showed therapeutic efficacy in mice, even when administered as a single dose 5 days after infection. A humanized version of E16 was generated that retained antigen specificity, avidity and neutralizing activity. In postexposure therapeutic trials in mice, a single dose of humanized E16 protected mice against WNV-induced mortality, and may therefore be a viable t!
 reatment option against WNV infection in humans.

SO  - Avian Diseases. American Association of Avian Pathologists, Kennett Square, USA: 2005. 49: 2, 252-259. 12 ref. 
AB  - The carcasses of 25 great horned owls and 12 goshawks were investigated for West Nile virus (WNV) infection by immunohistochemistry (IHC) performed on various organs, including brain, spinal cord, heart, kidney, eye, bone marrow, spleen, liver, lungs, pancreas, intestine, and proventriculus, using a WNV-antigen-specific monoclonal antibody and by WNV-specific reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), performed on fresh brain tissue only. WNV infection was diagnosed by IHC in all owls and all goshawks. WNV-specific RT-PCR amplified WNV-RNA in the brain of all goshawks but only 12 owls (48%). Cachexia was a common macroscopic finding associated with WNV infection in owls (76%). Myocarditis was occasionally macroscopically evident in goshawks (33%). Microscopically, inflammatory lesions, including lymphoplasmacytic and histiocytic encephalitis, myocarditis, endophthalmitis, and pancreatitis were present in both species but were more common and more severe !
 in goshawks than in owls. The most characteristic brain lesion in owls was the formation of glial nodules, in particular in the molecular layer of the cerebellum, while encephalitis affecting the periventricular parenchyma of the cerebral cortex was common in the goshawks. In owls, WNV-antigen-positive cells were present usually only in very small numbers per organ. Kidney (80%), heart (39%), and cerebellum (37%) were the organs that most commonly contained WNV antigen in owls. WNV antigen was frequently widely distributed in the organs of infected goshawks, with increased amounts of WNV antigen in the heart and the cerebrum. Spleen (75%), cerebellum (66%), heart (58%), cerebrum (58%), and eye (50%) were often WNV-antigen positive in goshawks. In contrast with the goshawks, WNV antigen was not present in cerebral and retinal neurons of owls. WNV infection appears to be capable of causing fatal disease in great horned owls and goshawks. However, the distribution and severity!
  of histologic lesions, the antigen distribution in the variou!
 s organs
, and the amount of antigen varied among both species. Therefore, the diagnostician may choose organs for histology and immunohistochemistry as well as RT-PCR depending on the investigated species in order to avoid false-negative results.

SO  - Avian Diseases. American Association of Avian Pathologists, Kennett Square, USA: 2005. 49: 2, 292-297. 34 ref. 
AB  - During November 2002, six double-crested cormorants (DCCs; Phalacrocorax auritus) were found moribund in Big Pine Key, FL, exhibiting clinical signs indicative of neurologic disease. Postmortem diagnostic evaluations were performed on two adult birds. Virulent Newcastle disease virus (NDV) was isolated from a cloacal swab from cormorant 1. West Nile virus (WNV) was isolated from the brain and lung of cormorant 2. Nucleotide sequence analysis of a portion of the fusion (F) protein gene of the NDV cormorant isolate revealed it shared a 100% deduced amino acid identity with only two viruses: the 1992 epizootic cormorant isolate from Minnesota and the 1992 turkey isolate from North Dakota. The epidemiologic significance of the recognition of virulent NDV on cormorant wintering grounds during a nonepizootic period, in addition to the potential implications of the concurrent isolation of NDV and WNV from cormorants, is discussed.

AB  - Epizootics of encephalitis in El Salvador killed 203 equines between November 2001 and April 2003. During an investigation of the outbreaks, 18 (25%) of 73 serum samples collected from stablemates of deceased animals in 2003 had antibodies to West Nile virus. Ten of these infections were confirmed by plaque reduction neutralization tests, suggesting West Nile virus has extended its range and spread to Central America.

AB  - Serosurveys were conducted to obtain flavivirus and West Nile virus (WNV) seroprevalence data from mammals. Sera from 513 small- and medium-sized mammals, collected during late summer and fall of 2003 from Colorado, Louisiana, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania, USA, were screened for flavivirus-specific antibodies. Serum samples containing antibody to flaviviruses were screened for WNV-specific antibodies by epitope-blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and confirmed with plaque reduction neutralization tests. Prevalence of WNV antibodies among study sites ranged from 0% to 42.8% among the mammal communities sampled. High prevalence rates for WNV were noted among raccoons (100%, with a very small sample size, N=2), Virginia opossums (50.0%), fox squirrels (49.1%), and eastern gray squirrels (48.3%). The high WNV antibody prevalence noted for tree squirrels, the peridomestic tendencies of several of these species, and their ease of observation could make these speci!
 es useful sentinels for monitoring WNV activity within urban communities.

TI  - Utility of the Focus Technologies West Nile virus immunoglobulin M capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for testing cerebrospinal fluid.
SO  - Journal of Clinical Microbiology. American Society for Microbiology (ASM), Washington, USA: 2004. 42: 1, 12-15. 1 ref. 
AB  - Focus Technologies has developed an immunoglobulin M (IgM) capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit that utilizes recombinant West Nile virus (WNV) antigens to detect WNV IgM in serum. We evaluate here the utility of the kit for detecting WNV IgM in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The sensitivity was evaluated by using 52 CSF specimens from the 2002 WNV season that were positive in both the Public Health Service Laboratories WNV IgM ELISA and an in-house WNV IgM ELISA with native WNV antigen. The specificity was evaluated with two groups of specimens: (i) 73 CSF specimens submitted for in-house WNV IgM ELISA testing from February through April 2003 and yielding a negative WNV IgM result and (ii) 60 CSF specimens determined to be positive for another virus by PCR testing. Using these 185 CSF specimens at a screening dilution of 1:2, the kit was determined to be 100% sensitive and 100% specific. Endpoint titers were determined for 20 IgM-positive CSF specimens by!
  testing serial twofold dilutions and ranged from 1:8 to 1:512. Index values (specimen absorbance value/calibrator absorbance value) for the screening dilution (1:2) showed no correlation with IgM titers, whereas index values for higher dilutions showed significant correlation with IgM titers. CSF screening dilutions of greater than 1:2 are not recommended, however, due to the risk of obtaining false-negative results. These findings show that the Focus Technologies WNV IgM capture ELISA, when utilized as recommended, offers accurate qualitative detection of WNV IgM in CSF specimens.

SO  - Journal of Clinical Microbiology. American Society for Microbiology (ASM), Washington, USA: 2004. 42: 1, 257-263. 5 ref. 
AB  - A one-step, single tube, real-time accelerated reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay was developed for detecting the envelope gene of West Nile (WN) virus. The RT-LAMP assay is a novel method of gene amplification that amplifies nucleic acid with high specificity, efficiency, and rapidity under isothermal conditions with a set of six specially designed primers that recognize eight distinct sequences of the target. The whole procedure is very simple and rapid, and amplification can be obtained in less than 1 h by incubating all of the reagents in a single tube with reverse transcriptase and Bst DNA polymerase at 63 degrees C. Detection of gene amplification could be accomplished by agarose gel electrophoresis, as well as by real-time monitoring in an inexpensive turbidimeter. When the sensitivity of the RT-LAMP assay was compared to that of conventional RT-PCR, it was found that the RT-LAMP assay demonstrated 10-fold higher sensiti!
 vity compared to RT-PCR, with a detection limit of 0.1 PFU of virus. By using real-time monitoring, 104 PFU of virus could be detected in as little as 17 min. The specificity of the RT-LAMP assay was validated by the absence of any cross-reaction with other, closely related, members of the Flavivirus group, followed by restriction digestion and nucleotide sequencing of the amplified product. These results indicate that the RT-LAMP assay is extremely rapid, cost-effective, highly sensitive, and specific and has potential usefulness for rapid, comprehensive WN virus surveillance along with virus isolation and/or serology.

SO  - Journal of Clinical Microbiology. American Society for Microbiology (ASM), Washington, USA: 2004. 42: 1, 65-72. 34 ref. 
AB  - We report a new, suspended-microsphere diagnostic test to detect antibodies to West Nile (WN) virus in human serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The microsphere immunofluorescence assay can be performed in less than 3 h on specimens of <=30 micro l. A recombinant WN virus envelope (E) protein antigen is covalently coupled to fluorescent polystyrene microspheres. After incubation with diluted serum or CSF, antibodies bound to the E protein antigen are detected with fluorescently labelled anti-human immunoglobulin antibody and flow analysis in a dual-laser Luminex 100 instrument. Retrospective testing of 833 sera from New York patients with suspected viral encephalitis demonstrated concordance with results obtained with the traditional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to WN virus (kappa=0.85). One hundred eighty-eight (22.4%) of the samples, which were collected from June to November 2002, tested positive for antibodies to WN virus!
  in the microsphere assay. Specimens depleted of IgG with anti-IgG antibody were reassayed to measure anti-E protein IgM antibodies and to provide an indication of current or recent WN virus infection. The assay also detects antibodies to E proteins from related flaviviruses, including St. Louis encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, and dengue viruses. The new microsphere immunoassay provides a sensitive and rapid alternative to traditional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays that detect antibodies to flavivirus E proteins. This assay can aid physicians and public health workers in the management of outbreaks of WN virus and related flaviviruses.

SO  - Virology. Elsevier Inc., San Diego, USA: 2005. 336: 1, 70-82. many ref. 
AB  - We produced nine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against the West Nile virus E glycoprotein using three different immunization strategies: inactivated virus, naked DNA, and recombinant protein. Most of the MAbs bound to conformation dependent epitopes in domain III of the E protein. Four of the MAbs neutralized WNV infection and bound to the same region of domain III with high affinity. The neutralizing MAbs were obtained from mice immunized with inactivated virus alone or in combination with a DNA plasmid. In contrast, MAbs obtained by immunization with a soluble version of the E glycoprotein did not exhibit neutralizing activity. These non-neutralizing antibodies were cross-reactive with several other flaviviruses, including Saint Louis encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, Yellow Fever and Powassan viruses. Interestingly, some non-neutralizing MAbs bound with high affinity to domains I or III, indicating that both affinity and the precise epitope recognized by !
 an antibody are important determinants of WNV neutralization.

SO  - Journal of Clinical Microbiology. American Society for Microbiology (ASM), Washington, USA: 2004. 42: 4, 1511-1518. 31 ref. 
AB  - Real-time quantitative PCR is used routinely for the high-throughput diagnosis of viral pathogens, such as West Nile virus (WNV). Rapidly evolving RNA viruses present a challenge for diagnosis because they accumulate mutations that may render them undetectable. To explore the effect of sequence variations on assay performance, we generated every possible single point mutation within the target region of the widely used TaqMan assay for WNV and found that the TaqMan assay failed to detect 47% of possible single nucleotide variations in the probe-binding site and was unable to detect any targets with more than two mutations. In response, we developed and validated a less expensive assay with the intercalating dye SYBR green. The SYBR green-based assay was as sensitive as the TaqMan assay for WNV. Importantly, it detected 100% of possible WNV target region variants. The assay developed here adds an additional layer of protection to guard against false-negative results tha!
 t result from natural variations or drug-directed selection and provides a rapid means to identify such variants for subsequent detailed analysis.

SO  - Journal of Clinical Microbiology. American Society for Microbiology (ASM), Washington, USA: 2004. 42: 2, 727-733. 14 ref. 
AB  - West Nile virus was introduced into the United States in 1999 and in only four seasons has become endemic east of the Rocky Mountains. Recently, immunoglobulin M (IgM)-capture enzyme immunoassays for the detection of West Nile virus-specific IgM and indirect IgG enzyme immunoassays for the detection of IgG antibodies against West Nile virus were made available from Focus Technologies and PANBIO, Inc. We evaluated these commercial IgG and IgM test systems and determined agreement, sensitivity, and specificity for the assays, compared to immunofluorescence assay and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's IgM-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Initially, the Focus and PANBIO IgM enzyme immunoassays had at least 95% agreement, sensitivity, and specificity, and, based on the 95% confidence intervals, both IgM-capture assays performed similarly. The IgG assays also performed well, although the Focus IgG assay demonstrated greater specificity (98.8%)!
  and the PANBIO IgG assay demonstrated greater sensitivity (99.3%). However, for 400 samples consecutively submitted for West Nile virus antibody testing during 2 days of the 2003 West Nile virus season, agreement, clinical sensitivity, and clinical specificity were 93.1, 98.0, and 92.4%, respectively, for the PANBIO IgM assay and were 97.4, 100.0, and 97.1%, respectively, for the Focus IgM assay. The specificities observed in this second evaluation equates to an overall false-positivity rate of 6.3% in the PANBIO West Nile virus IgM-capture ELISA versus 2.5% with the Focus West Nile virus IgM-capture ELISA. This experience demonstrates the importance of continuously evaluating the performance of an assay in order to detect any changes in assay performance as the test population evolves.

AB  - We report on the use of West Nile virus Armored RNA as an internal positive control (IPC) for the extraction and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) of RNA extracted from field-collected mosquitoes and on a multiplex real-time Taqman RT-PCR to simultaneously detect the 3' noncoding region of West Nile virus and the West Nile virus NS5-2 region comprising the IPC. Mosquito pools from the province of British Columbia, Canada (n=635), were tested in duplicate and found to be negative for West Nile virus and positive for the IPC. Known West Nile virus-positive supernatants from mosquito pools from the provinces of Alberta and Manitoba were tested in duplicate and found to be positive for both regions of the West Nile virus genome. The mean cycle threshold (Ct) value for the IPC in batch extraction controls +or-2 standard deviations was found to be 36.43+or-1.78 cycles. IPCs of 98.4% (624) of West Nile virus-negative pools fell within this range, indicating the reproducibili!
 ty of RNA extraction and RT-PCR for pools varying in mosquito genus and number. A comparison of mosquito pool genera revealed no significant genus effect on the Ct value of the IPC. The incorporation of West Nile virus Armored RNA as an IPC allows monitoring of RNA extraction and RT-PCR and detection of false-negative results due to failures in these processes or to PCR inhibition, respectively.

AB  - During the 2001, 2002, and 2003 enterovirus seasons, we investigated the correlations between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) nucleated cell counts and elevated CSF protein levels and the detection of enteroviral RNA by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Our objective was to determine if pleocytosis and/or elevated protein levels were predictive of positive RT-PCR results for enterovirus. We were also interested in determining if the presence of West Nile virus during the 2002 enteroviral season contributed to a change in these correlations. We found that in the group of patients aged >2 months, the absence of pleocytosis was highly predictive of a negative RT-PCR result. Elevated CSF protein level was not a good predictor of RT-PCR positivity for enterovirus and did not add to the diagnostic sensitivity or specificity of pleocytosis.

AB  - We have previously developed replicon vectors derived from the Australian flavivirus Kunjin that have a unique noncytopathic nature and have been shown to direct prolonged high-level expression of encoded heterologous genes in vitro and in vivo and to induce strong and long-lasting immune responses to encoded immunogens in mice. To facilitate further applications of these vectors in the form of virus-like particles (VLPs), we have now generated a stable BHK packaging cell line, tetKUNCprME, carrying a Kunjin structural gene cassette under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter. Withdrawal of tetracycline from the medium resulted in production of Kunjin structural proteins that were capable of packaging transfected and self-amplified Kunjin replicon RNA into the secreted VLPs at titers of up to 1.6x109 VLPs per ml. Furthermore, secreted KUN replicon VLPs from tetKUNCprME cells could be harvested continuously for as long as 10 days after RNA transfection, produ!
 cing a total yield of more than 1010 VLPs per 106 transfected cells. Passaging of VLPs on Vero cells or intracerebral injection into 2- to 4-day-old suckling mice illustrated the complete absence of any infectious Kunjin virus. tetKUNCprME cells were also capable of packaging replicon RNA from closely and distantly related flaviviruses, West Nile virus and dengue virus type 2, respectively. The utility of high-titer KUN replicon VLPs was demonstrated by showing increasing CD8+-T-cell responses to encoded foreign protein with increasing doses of KUN VLPs. A single dose of 2.5x107 VLPs carrying the human respiratory syncytial virus M2 gene induced 1,400 CD8 T cells per 106 splenocytes in an ex vivo gamma interferon enzyme-linked immunospot assay. The packaging cell line thus represents a significant advance in the development of the noncytopathic Kunjin virus replicon-based gene expression system and may be widely applicable to the basic studies of flavivirus RNA packaging an!
 d virus assembly as well as to the development of gene express!

AB  - Serological diagnosis of West Nile virus (WNV) infection is complicated by extensive antigenic cross-reactivity with other closely related flaviviruses, such as St. Louis encephalitis virus. Here we describe a recombinant, bacterially expressed antigen equivalent to structural domain III of the WNV envelope protein that has allowed clear discrimination of antibody responses to WNV from those against other related flaviviruses in indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays using standardized control antisera and field-collected samples.

AB  - Neutralization of flaviviruses by antibody is primarily mediated via epitopes in the viral envelope (E) protein. Comparative studies using neutralizing monoclonal antibodies revealed differential expression of epitopes within the E protein domain III of ten naturally occurring West Nile virus strains representing major subtypes of genetic lineages 1 and 2. Residues that defined these subtype-specific determinants were identified by mutational studies and found to be surface exposed in the domain III structure. Mutations of residue 332 had the most significant effects on variation of domain III neutralizing epitopes among strains.

AB  - A diagnostic method to distinguish between West Nile virus (WNV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) based on fluorogenic real-time polymerase chain reaction (TaqMan) assays was developed. To detect WNV and JEV with a single probe, a probe was designed to correspond to sequences in the core protein region that are shared by both viruses. The specificity of this assay depended on the primer sets used, which were specific to the target virus sequences: the primer set for WNV could detect only WNV strains and the primer set for JEV could detect only JEV strains. The assays were tested by detection of viruses from experimentally infected animal tissues. The method described in this study will be useful for the simultaneous discrimination of WNV and JEV in areas where JEV is endemic, such as East Asia.

AB  - Flaviviruses are a widespread and numerous group of arboviruses that can cause serious illness in humans. The continuous and slow spread of certain flaviviruses, such as Dengue viruses, and the recent entry and spread of West Nile virus to the American continent, point to the need to control these infections. This control requires the use of suitable techniques for diagnostic and surveillance programmes. A generic RT-nested-PCR that is, theoretically, able to detect each member of the group has been designed. The identification of the detected virus is carried out by sequencing. The introduction of an internal control would reduce the number of false negative results and could be used to quantify the viral load in clinical samples where the method works well.

SO  - Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association. American Veterinary Medical Association, Schaumburg, USA: 2005. 226: 8, 1349-1353. 20 ref. 
AB  - Objective - To estimate West Nile virus (WNV) infection rates, assess environmental variables that correlated with seropositivity in dogs and cats, and assess whether pets should be considered as possible sentinels for WNV and therefore of potential human exposure. Design - Cross-sectional serosurvey. Animals - 442 dogs and 138 cats. Procedure - Serum samples were screened for seropositivity against WNV by use of the plaque reduction neutralization test. Results - 116 (26%) dogs and 13 (9%) cats yielded positive results. The odds of seropositivity against WNV for outdoor-only family dogs were almost 19 times as great as those for indoor-only family dogs and almost twice as great for stray dogs as for family dogs. Family dogs not receiving heartworm medication were 2.5 times as likely to yield positive results for antibodies against WNV as family dogs receiving heartworm medication. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance - Seropositivity was greater for outdoor family dogs !
 than for indoor family dogs. Further investigation of the potential use of stray dogs as sentinel indicators for WNV infection and the potential risk of human exposure is warranted.

SO  - Journal of Medical Entomology. Entomological Society of America, Lanham, USA: 2005. 42: 2, 134-141. 21 ref. 
AB  - We show that the spatial-temporal variability of human West Nile (WN) cases and the transmission of West Nile virus (WNV) to sentinel chickens are associated with the spatial-temporal variability of drought and wetting in southern Florida. Land surface wetness conditions at 52 sites in 31 counties in southern Florida, USA for 2001-2003 were simulated and compared with the occurrence of human WN cases and the transmission of WNV to sentinel chickens within these counties. Both WNV transmission to sentinel chickens and the occurrence of human WN cases were associated with drought 2-6 months prior and land surface wetting 0.5-1.5 months prior. These dynamics are similar to the amplification and transmission patterns found in southern Florida for the closely related St. Louis encephalitis virus. Drought brings avian hosts and vector mosquitoes into close contact and facilitates the epizootic cycling and amplification of the arboviruses within these populations. Southern Fl!
 orida has not recorded a severe, widespread drought since the introduction of WNV into the state in 2001. Our results indicate that widespread drought in the spring followed by wetting during summer greatly increase the probability of a WNV epidemic in southern Florida.

AB  - Relevant blood transfusion-transmitted viruses are still HBV, HCV and HIV. As newly emerged infectious agent, the vCJD prion is relevant as well and will cause difficulties within the next decade, since there is no diagnostic tool applicable to blood donation testing. Still, the most effective measure for the virus safety of blood is donor selection followed by antibody and nucleic acid testing, followed by derichment and inactivation performed to the extent possible. For selected recipients, relevant viruses are CMV and Parvovirus B19. Diagnostic testing for both viruses is no challenge. The prevalence of HTLV-I is very low in Germany but higher in many other countries. Therefore epidemiological surveillance is sufficient to control the spread of this retrovirus in Germany. As the West Nile fever virus and the SARS coronavirus demonstrate, old viruses may newly enter the donor population and the efficient way to prevent these viruses from spreading is still the usual !
 quarantine for donors who have visited contaminated areas. The history of blood transfusion shows that by taking appropriate measures, safety will be increased, but also that new infectious agents will enter the donor population in future years.

AB  - Samples of laboratory propagated Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE), West Nile (WN), and yellow fever (YF) viruses were blotted onto filter paper discs, air-dried, and stored at room temperature. At regular intervals over a 90-day period, the dried virus samples were eluted, tested for infectivity by culture and titration in Vero cells, and examined for viral RNA by a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The VEE, WN, and YF viral RNA was detected throughout the 90-day period in all samples examined. Infectious VEE virus could be recovered for up to 40 days; WN and YF viruses were cultured in Vero cells for up to 60 and 90 days, respectively. The results of this study demonstrate that viral nucleic acids and infectious virus can be recovered from arbovirus samples air-dried on filter paper and stored at room temperature for a month or more after collection. This procedure offers a simple and inexpensive method for collecting arbovirus field specimens and t!

AB  - The arboviral surveillance program in California depends in part on sentinel chickens to detect western equine encephalomyelitis virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, and West Nile virus activity. From 2000 through 2002, 1,578 serum specimens from 34 sentinel flocks in northern and southern California were tested for antibodies to Culex tarsalis salivary gland antigens. Sentinel chickens that were seropositive for mosquito salivary gland antigens were more likely to seroconvert to St. Louis encephalitis virus than those seronegative for salivary gland antigens. Flocks with mosquito traps located <50 feet away had a reduced antibody response to mosquito salivary gland antigens. The use of sentinel chickens and mosquito traps for arboviral surveillance should be standardized to ensure that surveillance data from different sites are comparable and that flocks have comparable opportunities for mosquito exposure. Sentinel chickens should be accessible to potential mosquito v!
 ectors to maximize their sensitivity for detecting arboviral activity.

SO  - Vector Borne and Zoonotic Diseases. Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., Larchmont, USA: 2005. 5: 1, 1-10. 38 ref. 
AB  - West Nile virus (WN), an agent of significant human and veterinary disease, is endemic in the Old World and rapidly spreading throughout the Americas. Vaccines are needed to halt the geographic expansion of this virus and prevent disease where it is established. However, to preclude introduction of a vaccine virus into the environment, a live attenuated WN vaccine should have low potential for transmission by mosquitoes. A chimeric WN vaccine candidate was previously generated by replacing the membrane and envelope structural protein genes of recombinant dengue type 4 virus (rDEN4) with those of WN; a derivative of this virus, WN/DEN4-3' Delta 30, contains a 30-nucleotide deletion in the 3' untranslated region. To assess the potential for transmission by mosquitoes of these vaccine candidates, the ability of each chimeric virus to infect the mosquito midgut, disseminate to the head, and pass into the saliva was compared to that of their wild-type parental WN and DEN4 v!
 iruses in three vector species. The WN/DEN4 chimeric viruses were significantly attenuated in both Culex tarsalis, a vector able to transmit WN but not dengue, and in Ae. aegypti, a vector able to transmit dengue but not WN. However, the chimeric viruses were as infectious as either wild-type virus for Ae. albopictus, a vector able to transmit both dengue and WN. These results indicate that chimerization caused a contraction in vector host range rather than universal attenuation for mosquitoes per se. This restriction in potential vectors renders it less likely that WN/DEN4 and WN/DEN4-3' Delta 30 would be transmitted from vaccinees to mosquitoes.

SO  - Vector Borne and Zoonotic Diseases. Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., Larchmont, USA: 2005. 5: 1, 40-47. 27 ref. 
AB  - Transmission of West Nile virus (WNV) by Ochlerotatus trivittatus, Culex pipiens, and Aedes albopictus were compared 14 days after taking blood meals from viremic chickens with titers ranging from 102.5 to 109.5 cell infective dose 50s (CID50s)/mL serum. Transmission occurred in one of four (25%) Oc. trivittatus and one of 25 (4%) Cx. pipiens that fed on chickens with titers of 105.5 CID50s/mL. No transmission occurred among two of 16 (13%) Oc. trivittatus or one of 25 (4%) Cx. pipiens that became infected after blood meals with titers of 105.0 and 104.5 CID50s/mL, the next lowest blood meal titers evaluated. Seventeen of 28 (61%) Ae. albopictus transmitted WNV after blood meals with titers of 107.0 CID50s/mL, but no infection or transmission was observed among 21 Ae. albopictus that fed on chickens with titers of 105.0 CID50s/mL, the next lowest titer evaluated. Transmission by all three species increased dramatically after blood meals with WNV titers of >=105.5 CID50!
 s/mL. No significant differences occurred in dissemination and transmission rates of the three species after taking blood meals with titers of >107.0 CID50s/mL. The cumulative mean+or-SE transmission rates of Oc. trivittatus, Cx. pipiens, and Ae. albopictus after blood meals with titers of >=107.0 CID50s/mL were 45.5+or-4.1%, 46.8+or-4.5%, and 72.4+or-5.5%. The cumulative mean dissemination rates of the three species were 78.3+or-6.7%, 74.8+or-2.6%, and 88.6+or-2.1%. The rates of transmission by the three species that developed disseminated infections after blood meals with titers of >=107.0 CID50s/mL were 58.8+or-4.4%, 62.6+or-5.8%, and 81.6+or-5.4%, respectively. In a previous study, we found that susceptibility of the three species to WNV was essentially the same when fed on chickens with WNV titers of >107.0 CID50s/mL, but Oc. trivittatus and Cx. pipiens were more susceptible than Ae. albopictus to WNV at lower virus titers. The current study strongly suggests that Ae. !
 albopictus is a more efficient vector than Oc. trivittatus and!
  Cx. pip
iens when fed blood meals with titers of >107.0 CID50s/mL. However, Oc. trivittatus and Cx. pipiens might be more efficient as vectors when infected by blood meals with titers of <107.0 CID50s/mL.

AB  - Mites and soft ticks collected directly from wild and domestic birds and their nests were tested for the presence of West Nile virus (WNV). The cattle egret argas, Argas arboreus, was collected from the nests of seven cattle egret colonies. Out of 1,000 A. arboreus pools examined, 16 were positive for WNV based on RT-PCR technique. The positive pools were from four nesting colonies of birds. Out of 37 cattle egret squabs examined, 37.8% had serum-neutralizing antibodies to WNV. WNV RNA was also detected in one out of 15 pools of R. turanicus, in one out of 21 pools of O. sylviarum, and in one out of 18 pools of D. gallinae, while 63 pools of A. reflexus, 11 of R. sanguineus, and 30 of Hyalomma spec. were negative.

AB  - We investigated mosquito and bird involvement in West Nile virus (WNV) transmission in July 2001 in Jefferson County, FL, and Lowndes County, GA. We detected 16 WNV-infected pools from Culex quinquefasciatus, Cx. salinarius, Cx. nigripalpus, and Culiseta melanura. In Florida, 11% of 353 bird sera neutralized WNV. Antibody prevalence was greatest in northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis, 75%), northern mockingbird (Mimus polyglottus, 50%), common ground-dove (Columbina passerina, 25%), common grackle (Quiscalus quiscula, 15%), domestic chicken (Gallus gallus, 16%), and house sparrow (Passer domesticus, 11%). Antibody-positive birds were detected in nine of 11 locations, among which prevalence in chickens ranged from 0% to 100%. Seropositive chickens were detected in Georgia as well. The primary transmission cycle of WNV in the southeastern United States apparently involves Culex mosquitoes and passerine birds. Chickens are frequently infected and may serve as effecti!

SO  - Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association. American Mosquito Control Association, Inc., Eatontown, USA: 2005. 21: 1, 33-38. 9 ref. 
AB  - St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana, USA, experienced an outbreak of West Nile virus (WNV) in 2002, with 40 human cases and 4 deaths, most occurring from June to August. Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus was believed to be the primary vector of WNV during the outbreak, although circumstantial evidence suggests that Aedes albopictus also may have been involved in transmission. Dead bird reports were the 1st indication of the outbreak and were an excellent indicator of WNV activity; however, sentinel chickens were the most effective in tracking viral activity. Although sentinel chickens tested positive 2-3 wk after the 1st dead bird, they peaked at about the same time as human cases, and continued testing positive when viral activity was no longer detected in birds and mosquito pools. Lag time between the 1st positive sentinel chicken and the peak in human cases was 6 wk. If this trend continues in the future, sentinel chickens could be used to predict the peak in number of human!
  cases. The 2002 WNV outbreak had a strong impact on operational budget of the St. Tammany Parish Mosquito Abatement District (88% increase above the 3-year average). Vector control activities accounted for most of the operational increase and consisted of targeted population reduction of known WNV-competent mosquito species. The goal of these activities was to prevent new human WNV cases. The 3- to 10-fold reduction in vector mosquito populations from May to August, together with a dramatic drop in number of new human cases by the end of August, indicated that our strategy was effective.

AB  - Sentinel fowls are used to detect western equine encephalomyelitis, St. Louis encephalitis, and West Nile virus activity. Flocks that receive high mosquito exposure will be most effective for surveillance purposes. However, mosquito population indices at the flock sites may only provide an indirect measure of potential exposure. Therefore, we developed an indirect enzyme immunoassay to detect fowls antibodies to salivary gland antigens (SGAs) from Culex tarsalis, the primary arbovirus vector in California. Fowls fed upon by Cx. tarsalis developed an antibody response that was proportional to the amount of exposure. Cross-reactivity between sera from Cx. tarsalis-exposed fowls and SGAs from Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus, Culex pipiens pipiens, Ochlerotatus melanimon, and Ochlerotatus sierrensis was likely due to shared SGAs among these species. This serological assay for mosquito exposure could be used to evaluate the sensitivity of sentinel flocks for detecting arbovi!
 ral activity.

SO  - Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association. American Mosquito Control Association, Inc., Eatontown, USA: 2005. 21: 1, 49-53. 22 ref. 
AB  - Saliva was collected from 4 species of mosquitoes intrathoracically inoculated with West Nile virus (WNV). The amount of infectious virus in the saliva was quantified by plaque assay and the number of WNV genomic equivalents (GE) was measured by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Ochlerotatus triseriatus had the greatest mean amount of infectious virus per saliva collection, followed by Aedes albopictus, Culex pipiens, and Cx. quinquefasciatus. The mean GE/saliva collection was also greatest in Oc. triseriatus, followed by Cx. quinquefasciatus, Cx. pipiens, and Ae. albopictus. The variance of log GE/saliva collection for Ae. albopictus was significantly lower than the variance for the other 3 species. This study provides a basis for comparing this component of vector competence and for determining the amounts of virus inoculated into vertebrates in experimental host competence studies.

SO  - Journal of Biological Chemistry. American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Inc, Bethesda, USA: 2005. 280: 4, 2896-2903. 39 ref. 
AB  - The flavivirus West Nile virus (WNV) has spread rapidly throughout the world in recent years causing fever, meningitis, encephalitis, and fatalities. Because the viral protease NS2B/NS3 is essential for replication, it is attracting attention as a potential therapeutic target, although there are currently no antiviral inhibitors for any flavivirus. This paper focuses on elucidating interactions between a hexapeptide substrate (Ac-KPGLKR-p-nitroanilide) and residues at S1 and S2 in the active site of WNV protease by comparing the catalytic activities of selected mutant recombinant proteases in vitro. Homology modeling enabled the predictions of key mutations in WNV NS3 protease at S1 (V115A/F, D129A/E/N, S135A, Y150A/F, S160A, and S163A) and S2 (N152A) that might influence substrate recognition and catalytic efficiency. Key conclusions are that the substrate P1 Arg strongly interacts with S1 residues Asp-129, Tyr-150, and Ser-163 and, to a lesser extent, Ser-160, and P2!
  Lys makes an essential interaction with Asn-152 at S2. The inferred substrate-enzyme interactions provide a basis for rational protease inhibitor design and optimization. High sequence conservation within flavivirus proteases means that this study may also be relevant to design of protease inhibitors for other flavivirus proteases.

AB  - In October 2002, West Nile virus (WNV) was identified in farmed American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) in Florida showing clinical signs and having microscopic lesions indicative of central nervous system disease. To perform seroepidemiologic studies, an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed to determine exposure of captive and wild alligators to WNV. To validate the test, a group of WNV-seropositive and -seronegative alligators were identified at the affected farm using haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). The indirect ELISA utilized a rabbit anti-alligator immunoglobulins polyclonal antibody as the secondary antibody, and inactivated WNV-infected Vero cells were used as the coating antigen. For all samples (n=58), the results of the ELISA were consistent with the HAI and PRNT findings. Plasma was collected from 669 free-ranging alligators from 21 sites across Florida in April and !
 October 2003. Four samples collected in April and six in October were positive for WNV antibodies using HAI, PRNT, and the indirect ELISA. This indicated that wild alligators in Florida have been exposed to WNV. These findings can be used as a baseline for future surveys.

Gross findings were unremarkable. Histologically, the brain had multifocal lymphoplasmacytic perivascular inflammation, scattered gliosis, and rare satellitosis. Mild haemorrhage and congestion in the retropharyngeal lymph nodes and mild lymphoid depletion in the tonsil were present. A reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test performed on brain yielded a positive result for West Nile virus. This represents the first report of fatal West Nile virus infection in a white-tailed deer.

SO  - Journal of Wildlife Diseases. Wildlife Disease Association, Lawrence, USA: 2005. 41: 1, 96-106. 38 ref. 
AB  - In September and October 2002, an epizootic of neurologic disease occurred at an alligator farm in Florida (USA). Three affected American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) were euthanatized and necropsied, and results confirmed infection with West Nile virus (WNV). The most significant microscopic lesions were a moderate heterophilic to lymphoplasmacytic meningoencephalomyelitis, necrotizing hepatitis and splenitis, pancreatic necrosis, myocardial degeneration with necrosis, mild interstitial pneumonia, heterophilic necrotizing stomatitis, and glossitis. Immunohistochemistry identified WNV antigen, with the most intense staining in liver, pancreas, spleen, and brain. Virus isolation and RNA detection by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction confirmed WNV infection in plasma and tissue samples. Of the tissues, liver had the highest viral loads (maximum 108.9 plaque-forming units [PFU]/0.5 cm3), whereas brain and spinal cord had the lowest viral loads (ma!
 ximum 106.6 PFU/0.5 cm3 each). Virus titers in plasma ranged from 103.6 to 106.5 PFU/ml, exceeding the threshold needed to infect Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes (105 PFU/ml). Thus, alligators may serve as a vertebrate amplifying host for WNV.

AB  - West Nile virus (WNV), an arthropod-borne virus belonging to the family Flaviviridae, had been recognized in Africa, Asia and the south of Europe for many decades. Only recently, it has been associated with an increasing number of outbreaks of encephalitis in humans and equines as well as an increasing number of infections in vertebrates of a wide variety of species. In this article, the data available on the incidence of WNV in vertebrates are reviewed. Moreover, the role of vertebrates in the transmission of WNV, the control of WNV infections in veterinary medicine as well as future perspectives are discussed. A wide variety of vertebrates, including more than 150 bird species and at least 30 other vertebrate species, are susceptible to WNV infection. The outcome of infection depends on the species, the age of the animal, its immune status and the pathogenicity of the WNV isolate. WNV infection of various birds, especially passeriforms, but also of young chickens and!
  domestic geese, results in high-titred viremia that allows arthropod-borne transmission. For other vertebrate species, only lemurs, lake frogs and hamsters develop suitable viremia levels to support arthropod-borne transmission. The role of vertebrates in direct, non-arthropod-borne transmission, such as via virus-contaminated organs, tissues or excretions is less well characterized. Even though direct transmission can occur among vertebrates of several species, data are lacking on the exact amounts of infectious virus needed. Finally, the increased importance of WNV infections has led to the development of killed, live-attenuated, DNA-recombinant and chimeric veterinary vaccines.

AB  - Investigations of biological invasions focus on patterns and processes that are related to introduction, establishment, spread and impacts of introduced species. This review focuses on the ecological interactions operating during invasions by the most prominent group of insect vectors of disease, mosquitoes. First, we review characteristics of non-native mosquito species that have established viable populations, and those invasive species that have spread widely and had major impacts, testing whether biotic characteristics are associated with the transition from established non-native to invasive. Second, we review the roles of interspecific competition, apparent competition, predation, intraguild predation and climatic limitation as causes of impacts on residents or as barriers to invasion. We concentrate on the best-studied invasive mosquito, Aedes albopictus, evaluating the application of basic ecological theory to invasions by Aedes albopictus. We develop a model b!
 ased on observations of Aedes albopictus for effects of resource competition and predation as barriers to invasion, evaluating which community and ecosystem characteristics favour invasion. Third, we evaluate the ways in which invasive mosquitoes have contributed to outbreaks of human and animal disease, considering specifically whether invasive mosquitoes create novel health threats, or modify disease transmission for existing pathogen-host systems.

AB  - The results of experiments comparing the pathogenesis of West Nile virus (WNV) following infection by mosquito bite, needle inoculation, and ingestion are reported. Adult hamsters were readily infected by all three routes. The level and duration of viremia, clinical manifestations, pathology, and antibody response in the hamsters following mosquito infection and needle inoculation were similar; after oral infection, the onset of viremia was delayed and the mortality was lower, but the level and duration of viremia, histopathology, and antibody response were similar to the other routes. The results from this and previously published studies indicate that a wide variety of animal species are susceptible to oral infection with WNV and that orally infected animals develop a viremia and illness similar to that following the bite of infected mosquitoes. Oral infection appears to be an alternative transmission mechanism used by a number of different flaviviruses; its potentia!
 l role in the natural history of WNV is discussed.

These findings are compatible with virus replication and persistent infection of renal epithelial cells. The potential clinical and virologic significance of these findings as well as their possible epidemiologic importance are discussed.

AB  - The Geneva Protocol of 1925 commits the signatory nations to refraining from the use of biological weapons. However, the terrorist assaults of September 2001 and, subsequently, the anthrax-containing letters are cause for great concerns: new threats to the security of nations are expected, as terrorist organizations seem to increasingly explore novel ways of spreading terror. In this context, naturally emerging diseases such as SARS, monkeypox or West Nile fever assume new importance because it is difficult to distinguish between natural epidemics and possible bioweapon assaults. Great efforts on the part of governments and public health authorities are necessary to counteract these threats.

AB  - At the end of the 70s, it was said that eradicating infectious diseases was possible. With the occurrence of AIDS and the discovery of new pathogens the come-back of infectious diseases was noted, 15 to 20 years later, and the concept of emerging infections was defined. An emerging infection is the appearance of a new infection or the increase of its incidence if not new. It also includes infections for which the incidence could increase because of favourable conditions. Several scenarios can be proposed: (1) the appearance of a new infection (AIDS or SARS); (2) the appearance of a known infection where it did not exist previously (West Nile virus infection in the USA); (3) an infection that existed but that was not diagnosed or could not be linked precisely to a particular infectious agent (hepatitis C before the discovery of the hepatitis C virus); (4) a known infection that increases its usual incidence (outbreaks); (5) infectious diseases for which current conditio!
 ns may facilitate transmission (decrease of immunization coverage). The deliberate release of a biological agent is one of the possible scenarios of emergence. Qualitative changes of infectious agents such as the resistance to anti-infectious agents may also contribute, through a selection mechanism, to the emergence of new infectious threat. Emerging infections result from the interaction between the agent, the host, and environment evolving according to human activity. Surveillance, research, laboratory capacity, and an effective public health system are key factors for their control.

AB  - A new recombinant West Nile virus (WNV) vaccine has been licensed for use in horses. Before this vaccine became available in 2004, the only equine WNV vaccine on the market had been an inactivated vaccine. Since the recombinant vaccine only expresses selected viral genes, the present study investigated whether a single dose of the recombinant vaccine is effective in producing an anamnestic serologic response in horses previously vaccinated with an inactivated WNV vaccine. Vaccination of horses with a canarypox-vectored recombinant vaccine, under field conditions, results in a marked anamnestic response in horses previously vaccinated with an inactivated WNV vaccine.

Both patients demonstrated substantial improvement in mentation and speech on the second day of experimental therapy, and neither required endotracheal intubation or admission to the intensive care unit during hospitalization. Moreover, during the 9-month follow-up period, one patient achieved complete recovery, and the other nearly achieved complete resolution of sequelae. To our knowledge, this is the first published report of the use of IFN- alpha to treat WNV encephalitis. Clinical trials are underway to further define the role of this therapy in persons with WNV encephalitis.

AB  - Although optimists once imagined that serious infectious disease threats would by now be conquered, newly emerging (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)), reemerging (e.g., West Nile virus), and even deliberately disseminated infectious diseases (e.g., anthrax bioterrorism) continue to appear throughout the world. Over the past decade, the global effort to identify and characterize infectious agents, decipher the underlying pathways by which they cause disease, and develop preventive measures and treatments for many of the world's most dangerous pathogens has resulted in considerable progress. Intramural and extramural investigators supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) have contributed substantially to this effort. This overview highlights selected NIAID-sponsored research advances over the past decade, with a focus on progress in combating HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, influenza, SARS, West Nile virus, and potenti!
 al bioterror agents. Many basic research discoveries have been translated into novel diagnostics, antiviral and antimicrobial compounds, and vaccines, often with extraordinary speed.

TI  - Antiviral activity of serum from the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis).
SO  - Antiviral Research. Elsevier, Amsterdam, Netherlands: 2005. 66: 1, 35-38. 9 ref. 
AB  - Serum from wild alligators was collected and tested for antibiotic activity against three enveloped viruses using cell-based assays. Alligator serum demonstrated antiviral activities against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1; IC50=0.9%), West Nile virus (WNV; IC50=4.3%), and Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1; IC50=3.4%). The inhibitory concentration (IC50) is defined as the concentration of serum that inhibits 50% of viral activity. The antiviral effects of the alligator serum were difficult to evaluate at high concentrations due to the inherent toxicity to the mammalian cells used to assay viral activities. The TC50 (serum concentration that reduces cell viability to 50%) values for the serum in the HIV-1, WNV, and HSV-1 assays were 32.8, 36.3 and 39.1%, respectively. Heat-treated serum (56 degrees C, 30 min) displayed IC50 values of >50, 9.8 and 14.9% for HIV-1, WNV and HSV-1 viruses, respectively. In addition, the TC50 values using heat-treated serum were !
 substantially elevated for all three assays, relative to untreated serum (47.3 to >50%). Alligator serum complement activity has been shown to be heat labile under these conditions. HIV-1 antiviral action was heat-sensitive, and thus possibly due to the action of serum complement, while the anti-WNV and anti-HSV-1 activities were not heat labile and thus probably not complement mediated.

TI  - West Nile Virus: the buzz on Ottawa residents' awareness, attitudes and practices.
SO  - Canadian Journal of Public Health. Canadian Public Health Association, Ottawa, Canada: 2005. 96: 2, 109-113. 19 ref. 
AB  - Background: In 2002, the City of Ottawa was interested in the public perception of West Nile Virus (WNV) and mosquito control. Their objectives were to assess: awareness of WNV, practices to reduce mosquito sources, personal protective measures, and attitudes towards community-based insecticide programmes. Methods: In July 2002, we administered a telephone survey to a random, stratified sample of urban, suburban and rural Ottawa households in Canada. Results: Surveys were completed for 491 households. Most (77.2%) respondents reported they had heard of WNV, and of these, 58.3% reported WNV was an important health issue. Mosquito repellent was the most common personal protective measure, reported among 72.5% of respondents, of whom 76.9% used diethyltoluamide products. Multivariate regression analyses showed that age was a significant predictor of repellent use, with respondents aged less than 51 years more likely to use repellent than older respondents (ORadj=2.0; 95% !
 CI: 1.2-2.3). This age group was also more likely to use at least one personal protective behaviour (ORadj=2.5; 95% CI: 1.4-4.5). Of 315 people selecting a justified time to larvicide, 4.8% chose "larvicides should never be used in Ottawa"; 33.4% stated that larviciding would be appropriate "when WNV was detected in birds or mosquitoes"; one third "needed more information" on the health and environmental effects of insecticides, prior to selecting a response. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the need for public education reinforcing WNV importance, emphasizing the health and environmental effects of insecticides as well as appropriate personal protective behaviours. Such messages should target older and urban residents.

TI  - Analysis of self-association of West Nile virus capsid protein and the crucial role played by Trp 69 in homodimerization.
SO  - Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications. Elsevier Inc., San Diego, USA: 2005. 329: 1, 246-255. 30 ref. 
AB  - The understanding of capsid (C) protein interactions with itself would provide important data on how the core is organized in flaviviruses during assembly. In this study, West Nile (WN) virus C protein was shown to form homodimers using yeast two-hybrid analysis in conjunction with mammalian two-hybrid and in vivo co-immunoprecipitation assays. To delineate the region on the C protein which mediates C-C dimerization, truncation studies were carried out. The results obtained clearly showed that the internal hydrophobic segment flanked by helix I and helix III of WN virus C protein is essential for the self-association of C protein. The crucial role played by Trp 69 in stabilizing the self-association of C protein was also demonstrated by mutating Trp to Gly/Arg/Phe. Substitution of the Trp residue with Gly/Arg abolished the dimerization, whereas substitution with Phe decreased the self-association significantly. The results of this study pinpoint a critical residue in t!
 he C protein that potentially plays a role in stabilizing the homotypic interaction.

TI  - An infectious West Nile virus that expresses a GFP reporter gene.
SO  - Virology. Elsevier Inc, San Diego, USA: 2005. 334: 1, 28-40. many ref. 
AB  - West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne, neurotropic flavivirus that causes encephalitis in humans and animals. Since being introduced into the Western hemisphere in 1999, WNV has spread rapidly across North America, identifying this virus as an important emerging pathogen. In this study, we developed a DNA-launched infectious molecular clone of WNV that encodes a GFP reporter gene. Transfection of cells with the plasmid encoding this recombinant virus (pWNII-GFP) resulted in the production of infectious WNV capable of expressing GFP at high levels shortly after infection of a variety of cell types, including primary neurons and dendritic cells. Infection of cells with WNII-GFP virus was productive, and could be inhibited with both monoclonal antibodies and interferon- beta , highlighting the potential of this system in the development and characterization of novel inhibitors and therapeutics for WNV infection. As expected, insertion of the reporter gene into the viral gen!
 ome was associated with a reduced rate of viral replication, providing the selective pressure for the development of variants that no longer encoded the full-length reporter gene cassette. We anticipate this DNA-based, infectious WNV reporter virus will allow novel approaches for the study of WNV infection and its inhibition both in vitro and in vivo.

SO  - Virology. Elsevier Inc, San Diego, USA: 2005. 332: 1, 38-44. 21 ref. 
AB  - Yokose virus (strain Oita-36) was isolated from the bat in Japan in 1971. In the present study, we determined complete nucleotide sequences of Yokose virus using RT-PCR and RACE techniques. Yokose virus genome consists of 10 857 nucleotides in length (accession no. AB114858), containing a single open reading frame (3425 amino acids) encoding 11 viral proteins. We deduced the boundaries of each protein in the polyprotein sequence according to the protein cleavage sites of other flaviviruses. The nucleotide sequences of the 5' and 3' nontranslated region (NTR) and amino acid sequences of individual proteins of the virus were compared with those of six other flaviviruses including Japanese encephalitis virus, dengue-2 virus, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, and Rio Bravo virus or Modoc virus. Yokose virus demonstrated the highest similarity to yellow fever virus. Yokose virus also has CS1 motif, which are well-conserved specifically in m!
 osquito-born flaviviruses, in its 3' NTR. When a part of the NS5 amino acid sequence (345 amino acids) was compared with those of other four flaviviruses, Entebbe bat virus, Sokuluk virus, Sepik virus, and yellow fever virus, the three former viruses are more closely related to Yokose virus than yellow fever virus. Human sera from dengue-virus-infected case and yellow fever vaccinee reacted with the viral proteins. Moreover, human serum from a yellow fever vaccinee weakly neutralized Yokose virus. Our results suggest that there are cross-reactive antigenicities among Yokose virus and other flaviviruses.

TI  - West Nile premembrane-envelope genetic vaccine encoded as a chimera containing the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of a lysosome-associated membrane protein: increased cellular concentration of the transgene product, targeting to the MHC II compartment, and enhanced neutralizing antibody response.
SO  - Virology. Elsevier Inc, San Diego, USA: 2005. 332: 1, 66-77. many ref. 
AB  - A genetic vaccine for West Nile virus (WN) has been synthesized with the WN premembrane-envelope (WN preM-E) gene sequences encoded as a chimera with the transmembrane and carboxyl terminal domains of the lysosome-associated membrane protein (LAMP). The LAMP sequences are used to direct the antigen protein to the major histocompatibility class II (MHC II) vesicular compartment of transfected professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Vaccine constructs encoding the native WN preM-E and WN preM-E/LAMP chimera were synthesized in pVAX1 and pITR plasmid backbones. Extracts of human fibroblast 293 and monkey kidney COS-7 cells transfected with the WN preM-E/LAMP chimera constructs contained much greater amounts of E than did the cells transfected with constructs encoding the native WN preM-E. This difference in the concentration of native E and the E/LAMP chimera in transfected cells is attributed to the secretion of native E. The amount of preM protein in cell extracts!
 , in contrast to the E protein, and the levels of DNA and RNA transcripts, did not differ between WN preM-E- and WN preM-E/LAMP-transfected cells. Additionally, confocal and immunoelectron microscopic analyses of transfected B cells showed localization of the WN preM-E/LAMP chimera in vesicular compartments containing endogenous LAMP, MHC II, and H2-M, whereas native viral preM-E lacking the LAMP sequences was distributed within the cellular vesicular network with little LAMP or MHC II association. Mice immunized with a DNA construct expressing the WN preM-E/LAMP antigen induced significant antibody and long-term neutralization titers in contrast to the minimal and short-lived neutralization titer of mice vaccinated with a plasmid expressing the untargeted antigen. These results underscore the utility of LAMP targeting of the WN envelope to the MHC II compartments in the design of a genetic WN vaccine.

TI  - The 2003 West Nile virus United States epidemic: the America's Blood Centers experience.
SO  - Transfusion. Blackwell Publishing, Boston, USA: 2005. 45: 4, 469-479. 13 ref. 
AB  - BACKGROUND: A detailed assessment of West Nile virus (WNV) yield is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the WNV nucleic acid amplification technology (NAT) screening implemented in 2003. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: WNV NAT screening and donation data were compiled from members of America's Blood Centers, which collect nearly 50 percent of the US blood supply. WNV RNA screening was performed with either the Gen-Probe/Chiron Procleix transcription-mediated amplification assay or the Roche TaqScreen polymerase chain reaction. Results of alternate NAT and WNV immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody assays conducted on index and follow-up samples were obtained from test manufacturers. Presumed WNV positivity was based on NAT repeat reactivity of the individual index donation whereas confirmatory status was based on additional IgM testing of the index donation and NAT and serology testing of follow-up samples. RESULTS: From July through October 2003, 2.5 million donations were scr!
 eened for WNV RNA. Of 877 NAT-reactive donations (screening positivity rate of 3.5 per 10 000 units), 430 (49%) were confirmed positive, whereas 68 (8%) lacking follow-up data remained presumed positive. The sensitivity and positive predictive value of a presumed viraemic result relative to final confirmatory status were 92 and 99 percent, respectively. WNV activity was highest in the central plains with prevalence per 10 000 peaking August 1 to 15 in Colorado (67.7) and South Dakota (77.5) and August 16 to 31 in Wyoming (74.1) and North Dakota (102.0). CONCLUSIONS: WNV screening interdicted many viraemic units, thereby reducing transfusion-transmitted infections. This study demonstrates that a national collaborative effort facilitates timely surveillance of blood donor infectious disease prevalence rates.

TI  - Detection of West Nile virus RNA and antibody in frozen plasma components from a voluntary market withdrawal during the 2002 peak epidemic.
SO  - Transfusion. Blackwell Publishing, Boston, USA: 2005. 45: 4, 480-486. 19 ref. 
AB  - BACKGROUND: The US West Nile virus (WNV) epidemic in the summer and fall of 2002 included the first documented cases of transfusion-transmitted WNV infection. In December 2002, the FDA supported a voluntary market withdrawal by the blood banking community of frozen blood components collected in WNV high-activity areas. At the time, the prevalence of viraemia and serological markers for WNV in the blood supply was undefined. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In collaboration with America's Blood Centers, 1468 frozen plasma components (of approx. 60 000 frozen units voluntarily withdrawn from the market) were selectively retrieved from the peak epidemic regions and season (June 23, 2002-September 28, 2002). These units were unlinked, subaliquoted, and tested by WNV enzyme immunoassays (EIAs; Focus Technologies and Abbott Laboratories) and nucleic acid amplification tests (NATs; Gen-Probe Inc. and Roche Molecular Systems). RESULTS: Of the 1468 EIA results from Abbott and Focus, 7!
  were anti-immunoglobulin M (IgM)- and anti-immunoglobulin G (IgG)-reactive by both assays, 8 and 1 were IgM-only-reactive, and 8 and 23 were IgG-only-reactive, respectively. NAT by Gen-Probe and Roche Molecular Systems yielded one RNA-positive, antibody-negative unit containing approximately 440 RNA copies per mL. An additional 10-fold replicate NAT testing by Gen-Probe on 14 of 15 IgM-reactive specimens yielded 2 additional IgM- and IgG-reactive units with low-level viraemia (i.e., 7/10 and 2/10 replicates tested reactive). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of acute (RNA-positive) and recent (IgM-seroreactive) WNV infections indicates that transfusion risk in high-risk areas could have been considerable and that voluntary market withdrawal of frozen components likely averted some WNV transfusion transmissions. The existence of very-low-level viraemic units raises concerns, because WNV minipool NAT screening will miss such units and individual NAT may not completely correct this !
 situation.

TI  - West Nile virus in Canadian blood donors.
SO  - Transfusion. Blackwell Publishing, Boston, USA: 2005. 45: 4, 487-491. 15 ref. 
AB  - BACKGROUND: Blood donation screening for West Nile virus (WNV) RNA by nucleic acid testing (NAT) was implemented in Canada in July 2003, and 14 WNV RNA-positive donations were identified. Samples were screened in minipools of six donations with a WNV assay (TaqScreen, Roche). Two of the donors were identified by single-donor screening that was initiated in the province of Saskatchewan, which had the highest prevalence of WNV in the country, in early September 2003. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The original 14 samples and follow-up samples (2-35 days after donation), available from 13 of the 14 donors were tested with an in-house, real-time, quantitative WNV NAT assay that was specific for WNV. A Health Canada reference reagent was used for calibration. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels were determined with commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. RESULTS: All donors tested positive for the presence of WNV with the in-house assay. Two donor!
 s, 18 and 19, identified by single-donor testing, had extremely low levels of viraemia and that could only be detected in 1:38 or 1:39 replicate tests. The titers of the remaining index samples ranged from below log2.8 (the limit of quantitation) to log4.7 NAT detectable units per mL. Three samples, from Donors 17, 18, and 19, were IgM-positive, whereas samples from Donors 18 and 19 were also IgG-positive. The remaining 10 donors with follow-up samples all seroconverted. CONCLUSION: The 14 WNV donor samples detected by routine screening were confirmed as WNV RNA-positive by a WNV RNA-specific in-house assay and by demonstration of seroconversion in 13 of the 14 donors.

SO  - Transfusion. Blackwell Publishing, Boston, USA: 2005. 45: 4, 492-499. 16 ref. 
AB  - BACKGROUND: Transfusion-transmitted West Nile virus (WNV) infections were first reported in 2002, which led to rapid development of investigational nucleic acid amplification tests (NAT). A study was conducted to evaluate sensitivities of WNV screening and supplemental NAT assays first employed in 2003. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-five member-coded panels were distributed to NAT assay manufacturers. Panels included five pedigreed WNV standards (1, 3, 10, 30, and 100 copies/mL), 15 or 16 donor units with very-low-level viraemia identified through 2003 screening, and four or five negative control samples. Samples were tested neat in 10 replicates by all assays; for NAT screening assays, 10 replicates were also performed on dilutions consistent with minipool (MP)-NAT. The viral load distribution for 142 MP-NAT yield donations was characterized, relative to the analytical sensitivity of MP-NAT systems. RESULTS: Analytical sensitivities (50% limits of detection [LoD] b!
 ased on Poisson model of detection of WNV standards) for screening NAT assays ranged from 3.4 to 29 copies per mL; when diluted consistent with MP pool sizes, the 50 percent LoD of screening NAT assays was reduced to 43 to 309 copies per mL. Analytical sensitivity of supplemental assays ranged from 1.5 to 7.7 copies per mL (50% LoD). Detection of RNA in donor units varied consistent with analytical LoD of assays. Detection of low-level viraemia after MP dilutions was particularly compromised for seropositive units, probably reflecting lower viral loads in the postseroconversion phase. Based on the viral load distribution of MP-NAT yield donations (median, 3519 copies/mL; range, <50-690 000), 13 to 24 percent of units had viral loads below the 50 percent LoD of screening NAT assays run in MP-NAT format. CONCLUSION: WNV screening and supplemental assays had generally excellent analytical sensitivity, comparable to human immunodeficiency virus-1 and hepatitis C virus NAT assay!
 s. The presence of low-level viremic units during epidemic per!
 iods and
 the impact of MP dilutions on sensitivity, however, suggest the need for further improvements in sensitivity as well as a role for targeted individual-donation NAT in epidemic regions.

SO  - Journal of Medical Entomology. Entomological Society of America, Lanham, USA: 2005. 42: 1, 57-62. 40 ref. 
AB  - Since its discovery in New York City (New York, USA) in 1999, West Nile virus (WNV) has become established over much of the continental United States and has been responsible for >10 000 cases of severe disease and 400 human fatalities, as well as thousands of fatal infections in horses. To develop appropriate surveillance and control strategies, the identification competent vector mosquitoes and how various factors influence their ability to transmit WNV must be determined. Therefore, we evaluated numerous mosquito species for their ability to transmit WNV under laboratory conditions. This report contains data for several mosquito species not reported previously, as well as a summary of transmission data compiled from previously reported studies. Mosquitoes were allowed to feed on chickens infected with WNV isolated from a crow that died during the 1999 outbreak in New York City. These mosquitoes were tested ~2 weeks later to determine infection, dissemination, and tr!
 ansmission rates. All Culex spp. tested were competent vectors in the laboratory and varied from highly efficient vectors (e.g., Culex tarsalis) to moderately efficient ones (e.g., Culex nigripalpus). Nearly all of the Culex spp. tested could serve as efficient enzootic or amplifying vectors for WNV. Several container-breeding Aedes spp. and Ochlerotatus spp. were highly efficient vectors under laboratory conditions, but because of their feeding preferences, would probably not be involved in the maintenance of WNV in nature. However, they would be potential bridge vectors between the avian-Culex cycle and mammalian hosts. In contrast, most of the surface pool-breeding Aedes spp. and Ochlerotatus spp. tested were relatively inefficient vectors under laboratory conditions and would probably not play a significant role in transmitting WNV in nature. In determining the potential for a mosquito species to become involved in transmitting WNV, it is necessary to consider not only !
 its laboratory vector competence but also its abundance, host-!
 feeding 
preference, involvement with other viruses with similar transmission cycles, and whether WNV has been isolated from this species under natural conditions.

AB  - The observation of avian mortality associated with West Nile virus (WNV) infection has become a hallmark epidemiological feature in the recent emergence of this pathogen in Israel and North America. To determine if phenotypic differences exist among different WNV isolates, we exposed house sparrows (Passer domesticus) captured in Larimer County, Colorado, USA, to low passage, lineage 1 WNV strains from North America (NY99), Kenya (KEN) and Australia (KUN; also known as Kunjin virus). House sparrows inoculated with the NY99 and KEN strains experienced similar mortality rates and viraemia profiles. The KUN strain elicited significantly lower-titred viraemia than other strains and induced no mortality. This study suggests that natural mortality in house sparrows due to Old World strains of WNV may be occurring where the KEN strain occurs.

SO  - Clinical and Applied Immunology Reviews. Elsevier, New York, USA: 2004. 5: 1, 45-63. 63 ref. 
AB  - The rapid spread of West Nile Virus (WNV) across the North American continent has led to a need to understand what assays for WNV antibodies are available and how they are used as diagnostic and epidemiologic tools. In this article, we review six methods for measuring WNV antibodies in human serum, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid. The complement fixation and hemagglutination inhibition assays were historically important; however, due to their low sensitivity, low specificity, and complex technical and reagent production issues, they are no longer in common use. The plaque reduction neutralization test is the gold standard for WNV antibody detection; due to its complexity and long turnaround time, however, it is increasingly reserved for establishing the presence of WNV infection in a geographic area and characterizing problematic samples. The immunofluorescence assay measures both IgG and IgM antibodies to WNV. Although historically considered insensitive, recent studi!
 es using commercially available slides have shown acceptable performance; the immunofluorescence assay is thus a cost-effective way to measure WNV antibodies in laboratories that routinely test small numbers of samples. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) format is the most popular method currently used to detect WNV IgG and IgM. Both indirect and monoclonal antibody-mediated antigen capture formats of IgG ELISAs have been described, whereas nearly all IgM ELISAs utilize the IgM capture format. Before 2000, WNV antibody ELISAs employed native WNV antigens; since then, there has been a dramatic shift toward using recombinant WNV antigens, particularly subviral particles containing the envelope protein. Like in the other assays mentioned, however, antibodies induced by other flavivirus infections may crossreact with both native and recombinant WNV antigens, necessitating concurrent measurement of antibodies to flaviviruses endemic in a given geographic area. The new!
  microsphere immunoassay shows great promise as a sensitive, s!
 pecific,
 and cost-effective method for simultaneously measuring antibodies to multiple flaviviruses. This method has also been used to characterize antibodies to nonstructural WNV proteins; these antibodies appear to be highly specific for WNV, and their measurement may soon be the test of choice for diagnosing WNV infection.

TI  - Potential transmission of West Nile virus in the British Isles: an ecological review of candidate mosquito bridge vectors.
SO  - Medical and Veterinary Entomology. Blackwell Publishing, Oxford, UK: 2005. 19: 1, 2-21. many ref. 
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) transmitted by mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) infects various vertebrates, being pathogenic for birds, horses and humans. After its discovery in tropical Africa, sporadic outbreaks of WNV occurred during recent decades in Eurasia, but not the British Isles*. WNV reached New York in 1999 and spread to California by 2003, causing widespread outbreaks of West Nile encephalitis across North America, transmitted by many species of mosquitoes, mainly Culex spp. The periodic reappearance of WNV in parts of continental Europe (from southern France to Romania) gives rise to concern over the possibility of WNV invading the British Isles. The British Isles have about 30 endemic mosquito species, several with seasonal abundance and other eco-behavioural characteristics predisposing them to serve as potential WNV bridge vectors from birds to humans. These include: the predominantly ornithophilic Culex pipiens L. and its anthropophilic biotype molestus Forskal!
 ; tree-hole adapted Anopheles plumbeus Stephens; saltmarsh-adapted Ochlerotatus caspius Pallas, Oc. detritus Haliday and Oc. dorsalis (Meigen); Coquillettidia richiardii Ficalbi, Culiseta annulata Schrank and Cs. morsitans (Theobald) from vegetated freshwater pools; Aedes cinereus Meigen, Oc. cantans Meigen and Oc. punctor Kirby from seasonal woodland pools. Those underlined have been found carrying WNV in other countries (12 species), including the rarer British species Aedes vexans (Meigen), Culex europaeus Ramos et al., Cx. modestus Ficalbi and Oc. sticticus (Meigen) as well as the Anopheles maculipennis Meigen complex (mainly An. atroparvus van Thiel and An. messeae Falleroni in Britain). Those implicated as key vectors of WNV in Europe are printed bold (four species). So far there is no proof of any arbovirus transmission by mosquitoes in the British Isles, although antibodies to Sindbis, Tahyna, Usutu and West Nile viruses have been detected in British birds. Neighbou!
 ring European countries have enzootic WNV and human infections!
  transmi
tted by mosquito species that are present in the British Isles. However, except for localized urban infestations of Cx. pipiens biotype molestus that can be readily eliminated, there appear to be few situations in the British Isles where humans and livestock are exposed to sustained risks of exposure to potential WNV vectors. Monitoring of mosquitoes and arbovirus surveillance are required to guard the British Isles against WNV outbreaks and introduction of more anthropophilic mosquitoes such as Stegomyia albopicta (Skuse) and Ochlerotatus japonicus (Theobald) that have recently invaded Europe, since they transmit arboviruses elsewhere.

SO  - Emerging Infectious Diseases. National Center for Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, USA: 2005. 11: 3, 425-429. 26 ref. 
AB  - In the northeast USA, control of West Nile virus (WNV) vectors has been unfocused because of a lack of accurate knowledge about the roles different mosquitoes play in WNV transmission. We analysed the risk posed by 10 species of mosquitoes for transmitting WNV to humans by using a novel risk assessment measure that combines information on the abundance, infection prevalence, vector competence, and biting behaviour of vectors. This analysis suggests that two species (Culex pipiens and Cx. restuans, Diptera: Culicidae) not previously considered important in transmitting WNV to humans may be responsible for up to 80% of human WNV infections in this region. This finding suggests that control efforts should be focused on these species which may reduce effects on nontarget wetland organisms. Our risk measure has broad applicability to other regions and diseases and can be adapted for use as a predictive tool of future human WNV infections.

SO  - Journal of Vector Ecology. Society for Vector Ecology, Corona, USA: 2004. 29: 2, 285-294. 36 ref. 
AB  - Gravid female traps are used for surveillance of populations of Culex spp. and arboviruses such as West Nile virus. Field trials evaluating various attributes of gravid female traps for collection of gravid Culex were conducted in rural habitats in Alachua and Marion Counties, FL (USA). Screened cage tests in the field were also used to compare trap models. Three trap models were evaluated: two based on the original Reiter design (Gravid CDC traps A and B) and one based on the revised Reiter design (gravid box trap). Trap model significantly affected collection of Culex quinquefasciatus and Culex nigripalpus; the greatest numbers were collected by the CDC gravid trap Aand CDC gravid trap B traps compared to the gravid box traps. There were no statistically significant differences between the collections with CDC gravid traps A and B. These patterns were similar at both sites and between early and late summer collections in Marion Co. In trials conducted in screened fie!
 ld cages with gravid Cx. quinquefasciatus, significantly more mosquitoes were collected in the CDC gravid trap A and B than in box gravid traps. Size of pan associated with the gravid traps was important and traps with larger pans collected more mosquitoes. Pan colour was also important in efficacy of traps, and traps with darker pans (black, green) collected more mosquitoes than traps with lighter pans (tan, white). The percentages of gravid mosquitoes in trap collections of Culex females ranged from 54.0% to 89.6% with no clear differences between model of trap, size of pan, or pan colour. Various attributes of gravid female traps impact the efficacy of the traps for Culex spp. and these should be considered in trapping programmes.

SO  - Antiviral Research. Elsevier, Amsterdam, Netherlands: 2005. 65: 2, 79-85. 33 ref. 
AB  - The objectives of this study were to determine if injection of West Nile virus (WNV) into timed-pregnant mice would result in fetal infection and if administration of WNV-reactive immunoglobulin would increase dam survival and reduce fetal viral titers. Dams injected on 7.5 days post-coitus (dpc) had detectable viral titers in the placenta 10.5 dpc with a mean titre of 104.9 50% cell-culture infectious doses per gram of tissue (CCID50/g tissue). The mean placental titre increased to 108.6 CCID50/g tissue at 12.5 dpc. Infectious virus was detectable 12.5 dpc in 10 of 10 fetuses with a mean titre of 107.5 CCID50/g tissue. Treatment of dams (challenged with WNV on 7.5 dpc) with WNV-reactive human immunoglobulin (Ig) on 8.5 and 9.5 dpc resulted in a significant reduction of virus in fetuses as compared with non-reactive human Ig-treated females on 12.5 dpc (P<=0.001). Treatment also resulted in survival of dams to term. Treatment of dams with WNV-reactive human Ig on 12.5 !
 and 13.5 dpc also resulted in reduction of viral titre on 14.5 dpc, indicating that later treatment may also be efficacious. This suggests that Ig treatment may be useful in treating fetal WNV infection in women.

SO  - Journal of Infectious Diseases. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, USA: 2005. 191: 2, 207-214. 55 ref. 
AB  - The Schwarz strain of measles virus (MV), a live attenuated RNA virus, is one of the safest and most effective human vaccines available. Immunization with MV vaccine expressing heterologous antigen is an attractive strategy to prevent emerging viral diseases. West Nile virus (WNV), which recently emerged in North America, is an important mosquito-borne flavivirus that causes numerous cases of human encephalitis, thus urging the development of a vaccine. To evaluate the efficacy of recombinant MV for the prevention of WNV encephalitis, we constructed a live attenuated Schwarz MV (MVSchw-sEWNV) expressing the secreted form of the envelope glycoprotein from the virulent IS-98-ST1 strain of WNV. Inoculation of MV-susceptible mice with MVSchw-sEWNV induced both high levels of specific anti-WNV neutralizing antibodies and protection from a lethal challenge with WNV. Passive administration with antisera to MVSchw-sEWNV prevented WNV encephalitis in BALB/c mice challenged with!
  a high dose of WNV. The present study is the first to report that a recombinant live attenuated vector based on an approved and widely used MV vaccine can protect against a heterologous, medically important pathogen.

Three of 6 immunocompetent patients had coinfections with viruses (1 each with herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, and West Nile virus), and 3 had coinfections with nonviral pathogens (2 with Ehrlichia chaffeensis and 1 with Mycoplasma pneumoniae). The EBV load was similar in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients and in patients with viral and nonviral coinfections. EBV lytic-cycle mRNA was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of 5 of 6 tested samples, indicating EBV replication in the CNS during coinfection.

Clinical abnormalities were not observed in the abnormal toxicity test using guineapigs or mice. Since signs of infection with West Nile virus were not observed in mice during the inactivation test, it was confirmed that the WNV vaccine is inactivated. No growth of bacteria or fungi was detected in the sterilization test, confirming that the WNV vaccine was sterile. The results of these tests confirm the safety of the WNV vaccine.

It is intended for professionals who deal with zoonotic diseases and also aimed to give the non-specialists the insight, prevalence and importance of zoonoses. The important diseases are covered in detail, while others are given only brief descriptions. The most common route of zoonotic infection in UK is foodborne followed by waterborne, direct contact and through insect vector sources. The report also discusses the major foodborne and waterborne zoonoses that are present in UK such as Campylobacter, Salmonella, Escherichia coli and Cryptosporidium. Different notifiable zoonotic diseases of animals like bovine tuberculosis, brucellosis, BSE, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, avian influenza and West Nile virus are also presented. Zoonotic diseases of viral (Hantavirus), bacterial (leptospirosis, listeriosis, lyme borreliosis, streptococcosis) and parasitic (hydatidosis, taeniasis, toxocarias!

AB  - West Nile disease is considered as a re-emerging disease in France. An ELISA IgG test was used to test the horses. Among the 488 horses sampled, 5.3% were positive. The disease is transmitted by infected mosquitoes to dead-end hosts like humans and horses with birds as reservoir hosts. The survey presented in this paper aimed at seeking for a low-level circulation of West Nile Virus and identifying risk factors for the infection of horses. Among the horses included in the study, four horses which were IgG negative in 2000 were found positive in 2001. The statistical analysis identified the following risk factors in the environment: breeding of game birds (OR=6,9; p=0.002) and the presence of ponds (OR=10,4; p=0.008). The spatial analysis suggested the presence of two significant clusters of positive stables in the dry zone. Our results suggest the presence of a low-level circulation of West Nile Virus during 2001. The risk factors identified should be evaluated in furt!
 her studies and, if confirmed, could be included in global surveillance protocols for the early warning of risk of an epidemic.

TI  - Gender determination and lack of sex-specific West Nile virus mortality in American crows.
SO  - Wildlife Society Bulletin. Wildlife Society, Bethesda, USA: 2004. 32: 3, 893-899. 21 ref. 
AB  - With a set of external measurements from a sample of known-sex American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) in central Illinois, we determined whether a published discriminant function for sex determination was applicable to crows in a different geographic location than the reference sample. Low classification success with this equation, likely due to geographic size differences in crows between regions, led to the creation of new age-specific discriminant functions, which correctly classified the sex of 100%, 100%, and 89% of hatch-year, subadult, and adult crows, respectively. This technique for gender determination is of timely importance as the American crow is a sentinel for West Nile virus transmission, and ecological studies of this species are important in understanding transmission dynamics. Gender determination by discriminant function of these Midwestern crows indicated that the 2002 West Nile virus epizootic did not cause sex-biased mortality.

AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) infection causes mortality in domestic birds, wild birds and horses. In man, WNV induces mild fever and may develop into acute meningitis, encephalitis or death. This paper reviews the distribution of WNV infection in Africa, Europe, Asia and North America. The 2 cycles of WNV transmission are described: primary (enzootic), involves avian hosts and ornithophilic mosquitoes; and secondary, involves non-avian hosts and eclectic mosquitoes, which could be a link between both cycles. The importance of several species of Culicidae, mainly Culex species, in WNV transmission is discussed. In Brazil, C. quinquefasciatus assumes an important role in WNV cycle, and combination of surveillance and vector control measures is required to avoid the emergence of WNV as a new public health problem in this country.

TI  - From the field: outbreak of West Nile virus in greater sage-grouse and guidelines for monitoring, handling, and submitting dead birds.
SO  - Wildlife Society Bulletin. Wildlife Society, Bethesda, USA: 2004. 32: 3, 1000-1006. 27 ref. 
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) resulted in a 25% decline in survival in four populations of radiomarked greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) across Alberta, Wyoming, and Montana in 2003. Unexpected impacts of WNV are disturbing because range-wide habitat loss and degradation already threaten sage-grouse populations. In the Powder River Basin of Wyoming and Montana, late-summer survival of sage-grouse was lower at a site with confirmed WNV mortalities (20%) than at two sites without (76%). Dramatic declines in both male and female lek attendance at the WNV site the following spring suggest that outbreaks may threaten some local populations with extirpation. The key to understanding broader impacts of WNV on sage-grouse is to monitor additional populations and to determine whether populations infected in 2003 are again impacted this year. To facilitate this process, we describe a strategy for monitoring WNV mortality in the field and provide information on how to handl!
 e, store, and submit dead birds for testing.

AB  - As part of the West Nile Virus Emergence Program in Yucatan, Mexico, carried out by the Mexican Ministry of Health, an extensive mosquito larvae survey was made throughout urban, suburban and rural localities within 66 municipalities of this State. Larval collections (2623 samples) from domiciliary and peridomiciliary habitats were made from August to December 2003 (rainy season). New municipality distribution records were established for 16 mosquito species. Psorophora howardii was recorded for Yucatan State for the first time. Aedes aegypti was the most widely distributed species, and was recorded in almost all the municipalities sampled, followed by Culex coronator, C. nigripalpus, C. quinquefasciatus, C. interrogator and C. thriambus. A wide variety of habitats, natural or manmade, were positive for mosquitoes, the most common being buckets, rock holes, water storage tanks and laundry or kitchen items, all of which hosted a large number of different species.

AB  - A flavivirus (strain 97-103) was isolated from Culex pipens mosquitoes in 1997 following floods in South Moravia, Czech Republic. The strain exhibited close antigenic relationship to West Nile virus (WNV) prototype strain Eg-101 in a cross-neutralization test. In this study, mouse pathogenicity characteristics and the complete nucleotide and putative amino acid sequences of isolate 97-103, named Rabensburg virus (RabV) after a nearby Austrian city, were determined. RabV shares only 75%-77% nucleotide identity and 89-90% amino acid identity with representative strains of WNV lineages 1 and 2. Another RabV strain (99-222) was isolated in the same location 2 years later; it showed >99% nucleotide identity to strain 97-103. Phylogenetic analyses of RabV, WNV strains, and other members of the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) complex clearly demonstrated that RabV is either a new (third) lineage of WNV or a novel flavivirus of the JEV group.

SO  - Presse Medicale. Editions Masson, Paris, France: 2005. 34: 2(2), 161-168. 45 ref. 
AB  - Often responsible for little known infections, today viral encephalitis viruses appear as a new bioterrorist menace, because of their easy production and their great pathogenic potential. Spraying is the best way to permit the rapid diffusion of certain encephalitis viruses. Diagnosis of viral encephalitis, predominating in tropical surroundings, is difficult. In the majority of cases, symptoms differ little from those of common flu. With supplementary examinations, the biological abnormalities are usually non-specific. There are no characteristic images on scans or MRI. Identification of the virus in the nasopharynx, blood or cerebrospinal fluid, in serology, PCR or RT-PCR permits confirmation of the virus. Treatment is essentially symptomatic and relies on appropriate reanimation measures. Ribavirin can be indicated in some cases such as the Rift Valley fever, but is formally contraindicated in West Nile encephalitis. The aim of terrorist groups: who would use this t!
 ype of weapon is more to provoke panic and disorganization than to kill as many people as possible.

AB  - The emergence of West Nile Virus, as well as other emerging diseases, is linked to complex ecosystem processes such as climate change and constitutes an important threat to population health. Traditional public health intervention activities related to vector surveillance and control tend to be reactive and limited in their ability to deal with multiple epidemics and in their consideration of population health determinants. This paper reviews the current status, transmission and spread of West Nile Virus in Canada, and describes how complex systems and geographical perspectives help to acknowledge the influence of ecosystem processes on population health. It also provides examples of how these perspectives can be integrated into population-based intervention strategies.

SO  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. National Academy of Sciences, Washington, USA: 2004. 101: 52, 18159-18164. 46 ref. 
AB  - Many pathogens, such as the agents of West Nile encephalitis and plague, are maintained in nature by animal reservoirs and transmitted to humans by arthropod vectors. Efforts to reduce disease incidence usually rely on vector control or immunization of humans. Lyme disease, for which no human vaccine is currently available, is a commonly reported vector-borne disease in North America and Europe. In a recently developed, ecological approach to disease prevention, we intervened in the natural cycle of the Lyme disease agent (Borrelia burgdorferi) by immunizing wild white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus), a reservoir host species, with either a recombinant antigen of the pathogen, outer surface protein A, or a negative control antigen in a repeated field experiment with paired experimental and control grids stratified by site. Outer surface protein A vaccination significantly reduced the prevalence of B. burgdorferi in nymphal black-legged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) colle!
 cted at the sites the following year in both experiments. The magnitude of the vaccine's effect at a given site correlated with the tick infection prevalence found on the control grid, which in turn correlated with mouse density. These data, as well as differences in the population structures of B. burgdorferi in sympatric ticks and mice, indicated that nonmouse hosts contributed more to infecting ticks than previously expected. Thus, where nonmouse hosts play a large role in infection dynamics, vaccination should be directed at additional species.

AB  - A larval survey of mosquitoes in artificial containers from indoor and outdoor environments in La Carpio, San Jose, Costa Rica. "La Carpio" is a community that suffered a dengue outbreak during the last months of the rainy season in 2002. During 2003, five hundred and eighty-two and 369 houses were visited in the dry and rainy season, respectively and the potential mosquito breeding sites were searched for larvae. Of 1160 water containers identified, 152 (13.0%) were positive for at least one species of mosquito larvae and two mosquito species were found in 9 (0.78%) of the containers. In order to estimate the mosquito diversity, and infestation index by species was calculated for each kind of container. Aedes aegypti, Culex quuinquefasciatus, C. restuans, C. coronator, and Limatus durhamii were identified. A. aegypti was the most common species, and it showed the highest infestation index for all the containers (p>0.05). In addition to A. aegypti, the presence of othe!
 r species of Culicidae could mask the success of campaigns for the prevention of dengue. This is also an important factor to consider in order to prevent the occurrence of emerging vectorborne diseases, such as West Nile Virus encephalitis.

He had a transient rash that enveloped his chest, arms and back. The patient was a pastor from a small town in rural Pennsylvania, USA. One week before admission, he spent the entire day outdoors at his church's picnic. On hospital day 3, the patient had tremor, myclonus, bradykinesia, postural instability and hyporeflexia. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination revealed significant plasmocytosis and moderate pleocytosis. His CSF was positive for anti-West Nile virus IgM by ELISA. His final diagnosis was West Nile virus-associated meningoencephalitis with acute flaccid paralysis and parkinsonism. The patient's fever eventually resolved, and his mental status returned to normal after 2 days. His parkinsonism symptoms gradually lessened, but still persisted 9 months after the initial presentation.

AB  - The envelope glycoprotein located at the outermost surface of the flavivirus particle mediates entry of virus into host cells. In this study, the involvement of domain III of West Nile virus (WNV-DIII) envelope protein in binding to host cell surface was investigated. WNV-DIII was first expressed as a recombinant protein and purified after a solubilization and refolding procedure. The refolded WNV-DIII protein displays a content of beta -sheets consistent with known homologous structures of other flavivirus envelope DIII, shown by using circular dichroism analysis. Purified recombinant WNV-DIII protein was able to inhibit WNV entry into Vero cells and C6/36 mosquito cells. Recombinant WNV-DIII only partially blocked the entry of dengue-2 (Den 2) virus into Vero cells. However, entry of Den 2 virus into C6/36 was blocked effectively by recombinant WNV-DIII. Murine polyclonal serum produced against recombinant WNV-DIII protein inhibited infection with WNV and to a much l!
 esser extent with Den 2 virus, as demonstrated by plaque neutralization assays. Together these results provided strong evidence that immunoglobulin-like DIII of WNV envelope protein is responsible for binding to receptor on the surface of host cells. The data also suggest that similar attachment molecule(s) or receptor(s) were used by WNV and Den 2 virus for entry into C6/36 mosquito cells.

SO  - Journal of Wildlife Diseases. Wildlife Disease Association, Lawrence, USA: 2004. 40: 4, 639-659. many ref. 
AB  - The potential for transport and dissemination of certain pathogenic microorganisms by migratory birds is of concern. Migratory birds might be involved in dispersal of microorganisms as their biological carriers, mechanical carriers, or as carriers of infected hematophagous ecto-parasites (e.g., ixodid ticks). Many species of microorganisms pathogenic to homeothermic vertebrates including humans have been associated with free-living migratory birds. Migratory birds of diverse species can play significant roles in the ecology and circulation of some arboviruses (e.g., eastern and western equine encephalomyelitis and Sindbis alphaviruses, West Nile and St. Louis encephalitis flaviviruses), influenza A virus, Newcastle disease virus, duck plague herpes-virus, Chlamydophila psittaci, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enterica, Pasteurella multocida, Mycobacterium avium, Candida spp., and avian hematozoans. The effic!
 iency of dispersal of pathogenic microorganisms depends on a wide variety of biotic and abiotic factors affecting the survival of the agent in, or disappearance from, a habitat or ecosystem in a new geographic area.

AB  - In 2002, West Nile virus (WNV) infection with clinical neurologic disease and encephalomyelitis was described in reindeer (Rangifer tarandus). The susceptibility of reindeer to WNV prompted questions concerning vaccination of reindeer to prevent WNV infection. Between January and April 2003, eleven 2-4-yr-old, castrated male reindeer, some of which had antibody titers suggestive of prior exposure to WNV, were vaccinated three times at 4-wk intervals with a commercially available vaccine approved for use in horses. No adverse reactions to vaccination were noted. All vaccinated reindeer developed high neutralizing antibody titers to WNV, as determined by the plaque reduction neutralization test. Reindeer without antibody titers from previous natural exposure to WNV required a primary vaccination and one or two booster vaccinations for development of neutralizing antibody to WNV. Protective efficacy of vaccination was not evaluated. Vaccination of reindeer for WNV may be !
 warranted in certain circumstances combined with management practices to limit exposure to potential vectors.

AB  - There are huge numbers of wild animals distributed throughout the world and the diversity of wildlife species is immense. Each landscape and habitat has a kaleidoscope of niches supporting an enormous variety of vertebrate and invertebrate species, and each species or taxon supports an even more impressive array of macro- and micro-parasites. Infectious pathogens that originate in wild animals have become increasingly important throughout the world in recent decades, as they have had substantial impacts on human health, agricultural production, wildlife-based economies and wildlife conservation. The emergence of these pathogens as significant health issues is associated with a range of causal factors, most of them linked to the sharp and exponential rise of global human activity. Among these causal factors are the burgeoning human population, the increased frequency and speed of local and international travel, the increase in human-assisted movement of animals and anim!
 al products, changing agricultural practices that favour the transfer of pathogens between wild and domestic animals, and a range of environmental changes that alter the distribution of wild hosts and vectors and thus facilitate the transmission of infectious agents. Two different patterns of transmission of pathogens from wild animals to humans are evident among these emerging zoonotic diseases. In one pattern, actual transmission of the pathogen to humans is a rare event but, once it has occurred, human-to-human transmission maintains the infection for some period of time or permanently. Some examples of pathogens with this pattern of transmission are human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome, influenza A, Ebola virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome. In the second pattern, direct or vector-mediated animal-to-human transmission is the usual source of human infection. Wild animal populations are the principal reservoirs of the pathogen and human!
 -to-human disease transmission is rare. Examples of pathogens !
 with thi
s pattern of transmission include rabies and other lyssaviruses, Nipah virus, West Nile virus, Hantavirus, and the agents of Lyme borreliosis, plague, tularaemia, leptospirosis and ehrlichiosis. These zoonotic diseases from wild animal sources all have trends that are rising sharply upwards. In this paper, the authors discuss the causal factors associated with the emergence or re-emergence of these zoonoses, and highlight a selection to provide a composite view of their range, variety and origins. However, most of these diseases are covered in more detail in dedicated papers elsewhere in this Review.

AB  - Over the past few decades, the geographical distribution of arthropod-borne zoonoses has dramatically expanded. The influence of human-induced or ecological changes on the risk of disease outbreaks is undeniable. However, few hypotheses have been proposed which address the re-emergence of these diseases, the spread of these viruses to previously uninfected areas and their establishment therein. Host and vector movements play an important role in the dissemination of pathogens, and the ability of these diseases to colonize previously uninfected areas may be explained by the diversity of hosts and vectors, the presence of favourable ecological conditions, and the successful adaptations of vectors or pathogens to new ecosystems. The objective of this paper is to describe the epidemiological processes of the vector-borne diseases Rift Valley fever, West Nile fever, Japanese encephalitis and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever.

AB  - Before the introduction of the West Nile virus (WNV) into the United States of America (USA) in 1999, conditions in North America were ideal for an arboviral epidemic. Such factors as the large, susceptible and non-immune animal and human populations, the presence of competent vectors, increasing international travel and commerce, existing methods for rapid dissemination and an ill-prepared animal and public health infrastructure all combined to create the essential elements for a severe animal and public health crisis - the 'perfect microbial storm'. The introduction of WNV into New York City was the final factor, serving as the catalyst to initiate one of the most significant epidemics in the USA. The spread of WNV across the country resulted in very large populations of wildlife, equines and people being exposed and infected. The epidemic is still not fully understood and its character continues to change and adapt. The recent recognition of a number of non-vector m!
 odes of transmission has revealed the disease as a greater threat and more difficult to control than first thought. West Nile virus gives every indication that it will become a permanent part of the 'medical landscape' of the USA, continuing to threaten wildlife, domestic animals and humans as a now endemic disease. This paper discusses the features of this extraordinary epidemic, and emphasises the need for an integrated surveillance system, greater diagnostic capacity and improved control strategies.

TI  - Immunological responses to West Nile virus in vaccinated and clinically affected horses.

AB  - Objective - To compare neutralizing antibody response between horses vaccinated against West Nile virus (WNV) and horses that survived naturally occurring infection. Design - Cross-sectional observational study. Animals - 187 horses vaccinated with a killed WNV vaccine and 37 horses with confirmed clinical WNV infection. Procedure - Serum was collected from vaccinated horses prior to and 4 to 6 weeks after completion of an initial vaccination series (2 doses) and 5 to 7 months later. Serum was collected from affected horses 4 to 6 weeks after laboratory diagnosis of infection and 5 to 7 months after the first sample was obtained. The IgM capture ELISA, plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), and microtiter virus neutralization test were used. Results - All affected horses had PRNT titers >=1:100 at 4 to 6 weeks after onset of disease, and 90% (18/20) maintained this titre for 5 to 7 months. After the second vaccination, 67% of vaccinated horses had PRNT titers >=1!
 :100 and 14% had titers <1:10. Five to 7 months later, 33% (28/84) of vaccinated horses had PRNT titers >=1:100, whereas 29% (24/84) had titers <1:10. Vaccinated and clinically affected horses' end point titers had decreased by 5 to 7 months after vaccination. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance - A portion of horses vaccinated against WNV may respond poorly. Vaccination every 6 months may be indicated in certain horses and in areas of high vector activity. Other preventative methods such as mosquito control are warranted to prevent WNV infection in horses.

AB  - Many viruses with RNA genomes have genetically diverse populations called quasispecies. The representation of any particular sequence within this quasispecies is a result of interactions between the host and environmental factors affecting the replication of the virus. Important biological properties are a direct result of the levels of diversity in the quasispecies 'cloud size', including adaptability and host range. RNA viruses have become the model system for the analysis of viral evolution due to the inherent error-prone nature of their genome-replicating enzymes that lack a proof-reading function. However, these viruses have also risen in their importance, due to the nature of the diseases that they inflict upon man as well as the crops and animals on which we are dependent. The emergence of previously described viruses into new geographic locations or of previously undescribed viruses into a new host or environment can be explosive and have far reaching consequen!
 ces. Recent examples include human immunodeficiency virus, West Nile virus, Newcastle disease virus, bluetongue virus and henipaviruses. This paper describes some recent incidents and our state of knowledge in this area.

AB  - This paper presents some of the concerns regarding the recently published guidelines in Canada, that promote testing donors of tissues and perfusable organs for West Nile virus (WNV) using nucleic acid amplification test (NAT). The importance of considering the pretest probability of active infection before testing, and the problems with NAT testing are discussed.
