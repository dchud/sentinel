AB: In order to better illuminate the genotoxic effects of a 'complex mixture'
  of anthropogenic chemical toxins, we have employed the comet assay to measure
  the level of genotoxicity induced in a sentinel animal species, Micropterus
  dolomieu. Our analysis reveals a significant level of genetic damage in
  Androscoggin River smallmouth bass that increases in a downstream gradient in
  parallel with toxic equivalent concentrations. Individual concentrations of
  recognized, anthropogenic chemical toxins in Androscoggin River fish tissues
  are measured on an annual basis as part of a State monitoring program.
  Subsequent fish consumption and river use advisories are issued based, in part,
  on these assessments.

AB: An investigation involving raccoons as a sentinel species at the Paducah
  Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP) and Ballard Wildlife Management Area in western
  Kentucky (USA) delineated the extent of exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls
  (PCBs). Three separate measures of hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) induction were
  used to evaluate raccoon physiological responses to PCB exposure. Hepatic CYP
  induction was estimated via determination of total CYP, dealkylase activities,
  and immunoreactive proteins. There were no differences in raccoon biomarker
  responses between study sites. Significant relationships between and among PCB
  residues and biomarkers indicated that hepatic CYP induction had occurred in
  response to PCB exposure. Pentoxyresorufin O-deethylase (PROD) activity,
  CYP1A1, and CYP1A2 were biomarkers most closely associated with PCB exposure.
  The rank order of responses was CYP1A1 > CYP1A2 > PROD > ethoxyresorufin O
  -deethylase (EROD) as related to raccoon liver PCB concentrations, whereas the
  order was CYP1A1 > PROD > EROD > CYP1A2 when regressed with total PCB
  concentrations in abdominal fat.

  the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP) in Western Kentucky (USA) delineated
  the extent of exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and PCB spatial
  distribution. Raccoon exposure to PCBs was demonstrated through analysis of
  subcutaneous fat, abdominal fat, liver, and brain tissues from raccoons
  collected at the PGDP but also was clearly evident in raccoons from a reference
  area situated along the Ohio River (USA). Raccoons with the highest tissue PCB
  concentrations appeared to be those inhabiting areas nearest the plant itself
  and most likely those that ventured into the plants interior. Male raccoons at
  the PGDP had similar concentrations of total PCBs in subcutaneous fat (1.86
  plus or minus 0.64 mu g/g) as males from the reference site (1.41 plus or minus
  0.35 mu g/g), but females had higher PCB body burdens than those at the
  reference site (9.90 plus or minus 6.13 mu g/g vs 0.75 plus or minus 0.40 mu
  g/g). Gross measurements of exposure to radiation-producing materials revealed
  that counts per minute exceeded background in 61% of PGDP raccoons compared
  with 27% at the reference site and five raccoons at the PGDP had beta counts
  that were more than twice the background. Differences among trapping success,
  growth rates, and serum chemistry parameters were noted but may have been
  related to habitat and other environmental and population density factors.

AB: The common garden snail has been proposed as a sentinel species for mapping
  environmental concentrations of toxic metals, since it accumulates high levels
  in its soft tissues. The capacity of Helix aspersa to quantify site differences
  is assessed here from a survey of 23 populations around UK and Wales with a
  wide range of contamination. Five adult snails were collected from each site
  during 1 week in 1990. Each replicate snail was partitioned into two soft
  tissue components (the hepatopancreas and the `rest') and their Pb, Cd, Cu and
  Zn levels compared with those in the soil (as an integrative long-term measure
  of exposure) and the leaves of one food plant, Taraxacum (as a measure of
  recent dietary exposure). Median concentrations in one or both tissue fractions
  correlated with both soil and vegetation levels for each metal except Cu. Whole
  soft tissue Zn, Pb and Cd concentrations were also correlated with either soil
  or Taraxacum or both. However, Cd and Zn levels were not independent of tissue
  dry weight and there were also interference effects between Pb, Cd and Zn in
  the `rest' and between Cd and Zn in all fractions. Lead in the hepatopancreas
  correlated with both soil and dietary sources, and was independent of dry
  weight. There was some correlation of Cd with Pb in this tissue. Outliers
  largely determined the relationship between hepatopancreatic Pb and both soil
  Pb and vegetation Pb. If sites with very high levels in each source were
  excluded from the analysis, the significant correlation of hepatopancreatic Pb
  with vegetation and soil concentrations disappear. This study emphasizes that
  sentinels have to do more than simply rank sites by their tissue
  concentrations: a prime criterion in their selection should be their capacity
  to quantify the magnitude of site differences.

AB: In the period 1997-2000, approximately 1,800,000 m super(3) of material
  dredged from the Port of Leghorn was discharged into a sea dumping site located
  14 miles from the coast. The red mullet (Mullus barbatus) was used as a
  bioindicator species for monitoring the biological impact of these discharges
  on a geographical and temporal scale. Organisms were sampled over three years
  (1998-2000) at different stations and several biomarkers, both of exposure and
  effect, were analyzed. Bioavailability of specific classes of pollutants was
  evaluated by analyzing levels of metallothioneins, the activity of cytochrome
  P450 1A (CYP1A) and of glutathione S-transferases. Among biomarkers of effect,
  special attention was paid to the balance between prooxidant challenge and
  antioxidant defenses, and to the appearance of damage caused by oxidative
  stress. The analyses of the main components of the antioxidant system included
  superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidases, glutathione reductase,
  glyoxalase I and II, and total glutathione. These data were integrated with the
  measurement of total oxyradical scavenging capacity (TOSC) as an indication of
  the overall biological resistance to toxicity of different forms of oxyradicals
  (peroxyl radicals, hydroxyl radicals and peroxynitrite). Results indicated a
  biological impact in organisms sampled near the disposal site; the impact was
  particularly evident during 1999 and mainly related to organic chemicals such
  as PAH. Exposure to these pollutants also caused variations in the levels and
  activity of several antioxidants. The analysis of TOSC, however, revealed that
  the overall capacity of specific tissues of organisms to absorb various
  oxidants was not seriously compromised when challenged with increased
  prooxidant pressures. Variations of single antioxidants were useful in
  revealing early warning "biological responses", while integration with TOSC
  analyses indicated if such changes also reflect a more integrated and
  functional "biological effect" with possible consequences at the organisms
  level. The red mullet appears to be a useful sentinel species for a biomarker
  approach to monitoring impact caused by dredged materials.

AB: The determination of field inactivation rates of oocysts in sludge and soil
  is important as many land applications use sludge as a means of fertilizing the
  soil. Approximately 2.5 x 10 super(5) oocysts were spiked into separate
  sentinel chambers containing a 1.0 g mixture of sludge and soil. The sentinel
  chambers were exposed to the soil surface environment for 60 days at a depth of
  10 cm in order to evaluate the field inactivation rates of oocysts. The mass
  balance approach was used to determine the number of oocysts lost in the
  experiments. The results of the study showed that oocysts could survive
  environmental stress in soil. The mean inactivation rate of oocysts in the
  sentinel chambers at time intervals of 0 to 17 days, 17 to 30 days, 30 to
  45days, and 45 to 60 days were 0.0045, 0.0033, 0.0043, and 0.012 day super(-1),
  respectively. Whereas, the mean inactivation rates of oocysts in control units
  at time intervals of 0 to 17 days, 17 to 30 days, 30 to 45 days, and 45 to 60
  days were 0.0023, 0.0019, 0.0017, and 0.0025 day super(-1), respectively. An
  average of 4.8 percent of oocysts were lost in the experiments. Overall, the
  study demonstrated the presence of viable oocysts in sludge samples, which
  could potentially be used to fertilize agricultural land.

  1 to August 31, 2000, covering a large geographic area of eastern and
  predominantly rural regions of the state. The relative risk of reporting a
  symptomatic pesticide exposure among individuals living within this geographic
  area was 1.8 (log likelihood ratio = 18.5, P = 0.0005). Geographic information
  systems can be effectively utilized by poison control centers to study regional
  and temporal variation in the incidence of human pesticide exposures. With the
  collection of more specific spatial identifiers, geographic information systems
  may have many additional applications in the surveillance and prevention of
  pesticide and other sentinel event exposures.

AB: The authors have reported on 5 young patients who had brain tumors that
  appeared within 10 yr of initial occupational exposures to radar. Four of the
  patients were less than 30 yr of age when the diagnoses were initially made.
  Brief induction periods that follow high exposures in individual sentinel
  patients are a recognized indicator of impending group risk, and these periods
  call attention to the need for precautionary measures. Similarly, reports of
  short induction periods for brain cancer on the side of the head in which there
  has been prior use of cell phones may also indicate increased risk.

AB: The bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) is one of the most studied birds
  of North America, and a great amount of natural life-history information,
  including the response of various stressors on the eagles' ability to
  reproduce, are well known. In Michigan, the eagle has been chosen to track the
  trends of bioaccumulative compounds of concern across watersheds in the state.
  The state has been divided into major watersheds, and 20% of these are surveyed
  each year. A control area in northern Minnesota, Voyageurs National Park, is
  also sampled annually. We report here on the methods used, the preliminary
  results of the 1999 field season, and how differences in mercury concentrations
  varied over a 10-year period. Mercury in feathers of nestling eagles declined
  over time only in Lakes Michigan and Huron, but have not decreased among other
  subpopulations in Michigan. Concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)
  and 4,4'-DDE in blood plasma from nestling eagles have declined over time for
  most subpopulations; however, they remain greater for breeding areas associated
  with the Great Lakes' food web. Sea eagles of the genus Haliaeetus are a good
  sentinel species to track trends in bioaccumulative compounds in aquatic
  systems.

AB: Following the introduction of automobile catalysts in the middle of the
  Eighties in Germany there is an increasing emission of the platinum-group
  -metals (PGM) platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd) and rhodium (Rh). Still, it remains
  unclear if these metals are bioavailable for aquatic animals and to which
  extent they accumulate in the aquatic biosphere. Zebra mussels (Dreissena
  polymorpha) were maintained in water containing road dust at a concentration of
  1 kg/101. Following an exposure period of 26 weeks, soft tissues of the mussels
  were analysed applying adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry (ACSV) for the
  determination of Pt and Rh and total-reflection X-ray fluorescence analysis
  after co-precipitation of Pd with mercury. This experiment revealed for the
  first time that all the three catalyst emitted metals were accumulated by
  mussels. The bioaccumulation increased in the following manner: Rh < Pt < Pd.
  Thus, the application of sentinel organisms in combination with modern trace
  analytical procedures in environmental impact studies does allow an assessment
  of the distribution and the degree of bioaccumulation of PGM in the
  environment, which is highly appreciated.

AB: The effect of prolonged exposure at two sites along the Reconquista River
  (Argentina), a highly polluted peri-urban water body, on brain
  acetylcholinesterase (AChE, EC 3.1.1.7, acetylcholine acetylhydrolase) of two
  teleosts was examined. Caged Cyprinus carpio and field-captured Cnesterodon
  decemmaculatus were used as sentinel organisms. Eserine concentration
  inhibiting 50% of AChE activity (IC sub(50)) and inhibition kinetic parameters
  were also evaluated. Interspecies IC sub(50) differences were found to agree
  with observed kinetic parameters (K sub(A), k sub(i) and k sub(c)), indicating
  that carps were more sensitive to eserine. Data obtained disclosed spatial
  differences and demonstrated the high sensitivity of AChE activity as an
  exposure biomarker. Marked species-related differences were detected, showing
  that enzyme determination of C. decemmaculatus is more effective in highly
  polluted sites. Considering the river water physicochemical profile, observed
  changes in AChE activities can be partly attributed to long-lasting raised
  concentrations of dissolved heavy metals.

AB: Iodine-129 is routinely released in the gaseous and liquid low-level
  radioactive effluents of nuclear spent fuel reprocessing plants. Environmental
  impact assessment of these discharges are performed based on monitoring samples
  of different types of natural indicators. Thyroid is considered as a relevant
  organ to monitor radioactive iodine isotopes. In this study, bovine thyroids
  were collected in herds located in the Cotentin area under the influence of
  authorized low level gaseous effluents of the La Hague nuclear fuel
  -reprocessing plant. For low level 129I/127I ratios, characteristic of
  environmental samples (10(-12) to 10(-7)), RNAA or SMA that includes important
  radiochemical preparation steps are used. This paper demonstrates the interest
  of direct gamma-X spectrometry to measure 129I activities, associated to INAA
  to measure 127I to attain higher ratios levels (10(-6) to 10(-4)). This study
  shows the interest of monitoring bovine thyroids considered as sentinel organs
  to characterize the dispersion in space and time of 129I discharged in low
  level radioactive gaseous effluents by the La Hague reprocessing plant.

AB: Levels of tributyltin (TBT) and its degradation products, mono- (MBT) and
  dibutyltin (DBT), as well as triphenyltin (TPT), were monitored in 10 stations
  along the Polish coast (Baltic Sea). Mussel--Mytilus edulis--and fish-
  -Platichthys flesus--were used as sentinel organisms. The bioaccumulation
  patterns of butyltin and phenyltin compounds varied substantially. Butyltins
  were detected in mussel tissue from all the sampled stations. Among them,
  organisms from the Gulf of Gdansk showed the highest residues (68 ng/g w.w. as
  Sn) in conjunction with elevated TBT/DBT ratios, which suggest recent inputs of
  TBT in the area. Additionally, flatfish were sampled in the Gulf of Gdansk, and
  different tissues (liver, digestive tube and gills) were analyzed separately.
  TPT, although undetected in mussels, was always present in fish. The highest
  organotin concentration was observed in the liver (369 ng/g w.w. as Sn) of fish
  caught near Gdansk port. Relatively high concentrations were observed in
  digestive tube, which points out the ingestion of organotin contaminated food
  as an important uptake route of those compounds in P. flesus.

AB: Behavioural serial sentinel surveillance survey for female sex workers
  (FSWs) was carried out in the Government Social Hygiene Clinics in Hong Kong
  during 1999 and 2000. A total of 1366 and 1451 FSWs participated in the
  questionnaire survey respectively. The results showed that the majority of FSWs
  attending the clinics were of Chinese ethnicity (83.8%, 87.6%) while Thai
  (13.0%, 9.4%) and Filipino (2.1%, 2.7%) were the main foreign ethnic groups.
  The karaoke night club was the most frequent reported workplace (32.0%, 32.6%)
  followed by a club (8.9%, 11.7%) and free-lancing (8.6%, 9.0%). The proportion
  of FSWs who always used condoms in vaginal sex with commercial sex partners was
  70.9% and 75.0% respectively (P = 0.038). Compared with previous results, a
  rising trend of condom use by FSWs in commercial sex was observed. However,
  there was a relatively low condom use during commercial oral sexual intercourse
  (30.7%, 36.6%) and sex with their regular sex partners in all forms of sexual
  activities. Client dislike is the main attributed factor for not wearing
  condoms. The point prevalence of both infectious syphilis and HIV infection was
  0.1% in both years. These data are useful for planning, resource allocation and
  evaluation of outreach activities and STI services targeting at FSWs and their
  clients. They provide a sampling framework for further surveillance.

AB: Recent studies revealed that intestinal acanthocephalans of fish can
  accumulate heavy metals to concentrations orders of magnitude higher than those
  in the host tissues or the aquatic environment. This significant heavy metal
  accumulation by acanthocephalans, even surpassing that of established free
  living accumulation bioindicators, encouraged us to study the bioavailability
  of the platinum-group-metals (PGM) Pt and Rh for parasites. These precious
  metals are used in catalytic converters of cars for exhaust gas purification in
  Europe since the early 1980s. In addition to the beneficial effect in reducing
  the emission of CH sub(x), CO and NO sub(x) of cars there is an increasing
  emission of these metals. However, it still remains unclear if these elements
  become accumulated in the biosphere and whether they affect the health of
  organisms. The present study reveals that in European eels (Anguilla anguilla)
  naturally infected with the eoacanthocephalan parasite Paratenuisentis ambiguus
  and experimentally exposed to ground catalytic converter material, the
  parasites take up and accumulate the catalytic active metals Pt and Rh whereas
  in the examined host tissues we found no metal uptake. Compared with the PGM
  concentrations in the water the worms contained 1600 times higher Rh and 50
  times higher Pt concentrations. Thus, the parasites can be used as sentinel
  organisms reflecting even very low levels of precious metals. The eel parasite,
  Paratenuisentis ambiguus, takes up and accumulates catalytic metals.

AB: It recently became clear that acanthocephalans parasitizing mammals can
  bioconcentrate several heavy metals to conspicuously higher concentrations than
  the tissues of their definitive hosts. As cestodes are more abundant in
  terrestrial animals than acanthocephalans, and thus potentially more useful in
  attempts toward passive as well as active biomonitoring, a very common tapeworm
  and its synanthropic mammalian host were selected for the present study. The
  tapeworm Hymenolepis diminuta and experimentally infected male Wistar rats of
  the CD-M-strain were investigated with respect to their lead accumulation. The
  worms were allowed to grow up for five weeks post infection followed by a five
  weeks oral lead exposure of the rats. After the exposure period the rats were
  killed and the metal levels were determined in muscle, liver, intestine, testes
  and kidney of the rats as well as in the parasites. Lead concentrations were
  found to be 17 times higher in the cestodes than in kidney, whereas metal
  levels in all other host tissues were below the detection limit. Thus, this
  study reveals that lead accumulation also occurs in cestodes parasitizing
  mammals. Due to a lack of adequate sentinel species in terrestrial habitats the
  host-parasite-system rat-H. diminuta appears to be a useful and promising
  bioindication system especially in urban ecosystems.

AB: The introduction of a St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLE) genotype new to
  southeastern California during 2000 was followed by focal enzootic
  amplification in the Coachella Valley that was detected by seroconversions of
  29 sentinel chickens in five of nine flocks of 10 chickens each, isolations of
  virus from 30 of 538 pools of 50 Culex tarsalis Coquillett females, and
  collection of 30 positive sera from 2,205 wild birds. This SLE strain over
  wintered successfully and then amplified during the summer of 2001, with 47
  sentinel seroconversions in eight of nine flocks, 70 virus isolations from 719
  pools of Cx. tarsalis and Cx. p. quinquefasciatus Say, and 40 positive sera
  from 847 wild birds. Human illness was not detected by passive case
  surveillance, despite issuance of a health alert during 2001. Virus
  amplification during both years was associated with above average temperatures
  conducive for extrinsic incubation and below average precipitation during
  spring associated with below average vector abundance. Seroconversions by
  sentinel chickens provided the timely detection of virus activity, with initial
  conversions detected before positive mosquito pools or wild bird infections.
  Vertical infection was not detected among Cx. tarsalis adults reared from
  immatures collected during the fall-winter of 2000, even though SLE over
  wintered successfully in this area. Early seroconversions by a sentinel chicken
  during February 2001 and a recaptured Gambel's quail in April 2001 provided
  evidence for transmission during winter and spring when ambient temperatures
  averaged below 17 'C, the threshold for SLE replication.

AB: The fact that raccoons (Procyon lotor) are an opportunistic omnivore has
  severely complicated interpretations of contaminant uptake patterns due to the
  inability to determine the trophic position an individual occupies. Moreover,
  few studies have examined the relationships between heavy metal bioaccumulation
  and trophic structure, especially in the terrestrial environment. In this
  study, the stable isotopes of nitrogen were used to characterize the feeding
  habits of the raccoon at the population level and to determine whether metal
  burden was related to trophic feeding structure within a well-defined
  ecosystem. Raccoon populations were isotopically distinct, and significant
  positive relationships existed between some trace element contents and d
  super(15)N of muscle when site was used as a covariable in a statistical model.
  Although the transfer of metals through terrestrial ecosystems is complex, our
  study showed that some of the variation in contaminant body burdens in raccoon
  populations can be attributed to trophic feeding position and that super(15)N/
  super(14)N ratios of muscle tissue provide a quantitative measure of this
  process. The potential for using omnivores such as the raccoon, as a sentinel
  species for contaminant studies, should be explored further since the ambiguity
  of the relative trophic level an animal occupies can be directly estimated.
  This provides a more extensive sampling across trophic levels using a single
  species, which can have broad consequences for ecological risk assessments.

AB: A histopathological assessment of the gonad of male fish was performed as
  part of biological field studies carried out in coastal waters and small rivers
  in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, northeastern Germany. In the marine
  environment the eelpout (Zoarces viviparus) was selected as sentinel species.
  The three spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and perch (Perca
  fluviatilis) were chosen at freshwater locations. Histopathology of the testis
  revealed the presence of intersexuality in specimens of all three species. The
  intersex condition was defined by the simultaneous presence of primary oocytes
  within the apparently normal testis tissue. In comparison to stickleback and
  perch the eelpout exhibited the highest intersex prevalence and the most severe
  histological alterations. Fish with intersex were found at contaminated marine
  and freshwater stations as well as at sites with apparently little pollution.
  The findings suggest that feminised male fish were exposed to endocrine
  disrupting substances in the aquatic environment.

AB: The presence of chemical contaminants in marine coastal waters is a major
  subject of concern since many molecules are potentially immunotoxic, even at
  low concentration. During the last decade, studies in sentinel species, such as
  the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, or the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, have
  revealed that immunosuppressive responses can be related to xenobiotic
  exposure, in the laboratory and in the field. In the present study, European
  flat oysters were experimentally exposed to heavy metals, to investigate
  possible alterations of their immune function. Several hematological and
  functional parameters of hemocytes were measured by flow cytometry, a technique
  allowing rapid, sensitive, cell-by-cell measurements in large cell populations.
  Results reveal a depression of phagocytosis and several subcellular,
  physiological changes in oysters exposed to cadmium alone or to cadmium and
  copper, suggesting an overall alteration of the phagocytic function.

AB: Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a class of widely used flame
  retardants, are extensively diffused in the environment as shown by several
  studies on sentinel animal species, as well as humans. Of particular concern
  are the reported high levels of PBDEs in human milk, as almost no information
  is available on their potential effects on developing organisms. We
  investigated the effects of perinatal PBDE exposure on mouse neurobehavioural
  development. 2,2',4,4',5-pentabromodiphenylether (PBDE 99; 0.6, 6 and 30 mg/kg
  per day) was administered daily to CD-1 Swiss females by gavage from
  gestational day (GD) 6 to postnatal day (PND) 21. Aroclor 1254 (A1254; 6 mg/kg
  per day), a PCB mixture, was administered following the same schedule and
  served as a positive control. The PBDE 99 medium dose had an effect on litter
  viability. Sensori-motor development analysis (PNDs 2-20) revealed a delayed
  appearance of climbing response in the PBDE 99 high-dose group. On PND 11, the
  homing test revealed a trend for treated animals, particularly the A1254 group,
  to be more active than controls. This activity level alteration was strongly
  increased on PNDs 34 and 60 in an open-field arena. On PND 60, treated mice
  showed also an altered thigmotaxis, spending more time in the centre of the
  arena than controls. At adulthood, A1254 treated mice were still hyperactive,
  whereas the PBDE 99 groups tended to be hypoactive. These findings showed that
  perinatal exposure to PBDE 99 produces several behavioural alterations and that
  its effects are not always similar to those of A1254. The possibility of
  exposure of neonates to PBDEs warrants further studies to characterise their
  developmental neurotoxicity.

AB: We report a sentinel case of acute eosinophilic pneumonia in a firefighter
  exposed to high concentrations of World Trade Center dust during the rescue
  effort from September 11 to 24. The firefighter presented with a Pa sub(o2) of
  53 mm Hg and responded to oxygen and corticosteroids. Computed tomography scan
  showed patchy ground glass density, thickened bronchial walls, and bilateral
  pleural effusions. Bronchoalveolar lavage recovered 70% eosinophils, with only
  1% eosinophils in peripheral blood. Eosinophils were not degranulated and
  increased levels of interleukin-5 were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage and
  serum. Mineralogic analysis counted 305 commercial asbestos fibers/10 super(6)
  macrophages including those with high aspect ratios, and significant quantities
  of fly ash and degraded fibrous glass. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia is a rare
  consequence of acute high dust exposure. World Trade Center dust consists of
  large particle-size silicates, but fly ash and asbestos fibers may be found in
  bronchoalveolar lavage cells.

AB: Biochemical measurements in the sentinel clam Chamaelea gallina have been
  used as biomarkers of marine pollution. In this study, S9, cytosolic fractions
  (CF), and microsomal fractions (MF) prepared from unexposed clams and clams
  exposed to model pollutants were used to activate 2-aminoanthracene (2-AA) and
  2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF) to mutagens in Salmonella typhimurium strain BA149,
  which overexpresses O-acetyltransferase. Arylamine activation was similar with
  subcellular fractions from unexposed and Aroclor 1254-exposed clams, but
  decreased with fractions from As(III)- and Cu(II)-exposed clams. Bioactivation
  of arylamines by CF was higher than by MF, and higher with NADH than with NADPH
  as the reducing agent. alpha-Naphthoflavone inhibited AAF activation by CF and
  MF, but increased 2-AA activation nearly twofold. In contrast to the results
  with arylamine activation, benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase (BPH) activity increased
  twofold in fractions from Aroclor 1254- and Cu(II)-exposed clams. Activation of
  2-AA was also evaluated using S9 fractions from clams sampled at littoral sites
  with different pollutant levels. Compared to a reference site, lower 2-AA
  bioactivation and higher BPH activity were found in clams containing high
  levels of copper and organic contaminants, although the differences were not
  statistically significant. While these findings agree with the results of the
  model Cu(II) exposure, the effects of other pollutants cannot be ruled out. The
  results of the study demonstrate that arylamine activation by clams is not
  preferentially catalyzed by microsomal monooxygenases but by unknown cytosolic
  system(s), and that bioactivation of 2-AA and AAF appears to occur by different
  pathways.

AB: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Several cases of acute colitis induced by non-steroidal
  anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been reported but the general role of
  recent NSAID intake as a risk factor for acute diarrhoea has not been studied
  to date. The aim of our study was to determine whether the risk of acute
  diarrhoea is increased by NSAIDs in a prospective series of acute diarrhoea
  cases which were seen by general practitioners in France and were serious
  enough to require a stool culture. Patients, physicians, and methods: A total
  of 285 consecutive patients with acute diarrhoea, seen by Sentinel general
  practitioners (GPs) between December 1998 and July 1999, were enrolled in a
  case crossover study in which each case served as his/her own control. GPs
  collected information on exposure to NSAIDs during the four month period
  preceding the onset of diarrhoea. The relative risk of NSAID related acute
  diarrhoea was estimated by comparing exposure to NSAIDs during a risk period
  preceding the onset of diarrhoea with exposure during the first part of the
  four month observation period. Three risk periods lasting for one, three, and
  six days before the onset of diarrhoea were considered. RESULTS: The relative
  risks of acute diarrhoea due to recent NSAID intake were increased for all
  three risk periods. These risks and their confidence intervals were 2.9 (1.4
  -6.1) for the one day risk period, 2.7 (1.4-5.1) for the three day period, and
  3.3 (2.0-5.4) for the six day period. CONCLUSION: Recent NSAID intake emerges
  as a risk factor for acute diarrhoea. We suggest that acute diarrhoea seen in
  general practice, and not only acute colitis seen by gastroenterologists,
  should be considered as a potential complication of recent NSAID intake.

AB: Two species of bivalves, Mya arenaria and Mactromeris polynima, were exposed
  to contaminated marine sediments from Baie des Anglais, Quebec, for a period of
  10 and 12 weeks, respectively, in order to determine if there was an effect on
  the phagocytic activity of hemocytes from each species. These sediments contain
  elevated levels of both PAHs and PCBs. Uncontaminated beach sand was used as
  control sediments. After a period of 4 weeks, each species of bivalves were
  sampled and hemocyte phagocytic activity was monitored by flow cytometry. While
  phagocytosis by hemocytes from M. polytiyma was significantly suppressed, those
  from M. arenaria were not different from beach sand-exposed controls. At the
  end of the exposure period, the phagocytic activity of hemocytes from both
  species was suppressed. Physiological parameters such as mantle proteins or
  malondialdehyde levels, total protein and total glycogen levels in the
  digestive gland were not affected by exposure to contaminated sediments.
  Moreover, the suppression of phagocytosis was well correlated with the transfer
  of contaminants from the sediments to the bivalves and their subsequent
  bioaccumulation, as demonstrated by the PCB body burden. These results support
  the use of bivalves as good sentinel species to survey sediment contamination
  and the usefulness of hemocyte phagocytic activity as a sensitive biomarker of
  exposure to organic contaminants.

AB: This study was undertaken to validate potential biomarkers of exposure and
  effects due to chemical contaminants in breeding colonies of the Great Blue
  Heron and the Black-crowned Night-Heron on the St. Lawrence River. Eggs and
  fledglings from both species were collected from many colonies along the River.
  The fledglings from colonies in freshwater and brackish water were more
  contaminated by mercury and PCBs than those from estuarine and gulf colonies.
  With respect to fledglings of the two heron species, some morphometric and
  blood biochemical measurements, including plasma thyroid hormones and retinol,
  were significantly different among colonies. Significant differences were also
  observed in liver retinoids, EROD and porphyrins among colonies. The results of
  this study suggest that plasma retinoids and thyroid hormones are good
  biomarkers of exposure and effects, and are sufficiently sensitive to reflect
  local and regional variations in contamination. Along with the measure of
  contaminants in egg and plasma, they constitute non-invasive biomarkers which
  represent an important criteria for long term monitoring of wildlife species.
  It is concluded that the Great Blue Heron is an appropriate sentinel species in
  the surveillance network for the St. Lawrence River.

AB: Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a class of widely used flame
  retardants, are extensively diffused in the environment as shown by several
  studies on sentinel animal species, as well as humans. Of particular concern
  are the reported high levels of PBDEs in human milk, as almost no information
  is available on their potential effects on developing organisms. We
  investigated the effects of perinatal PBDE exposure on mouse neurobehavioural
  development. 2,2',4,4,5-pentabromodiphenylether (PBDE 99; 0.6, 6 and 30 mg/kg
  per day) was administered daily to CD-1 Swiss females by gavage from
  gestational day (GD) 6 to postnatal day (PND) 21. Aroclor 1254 (A1254; 6 mg/ kg
  per day), a PCB mixture, was administered following the same schedule and
  served as a positive controL The PBDE 99 medium dose had an effect on litter
  viability. Sensori-motor development analysis (PNDs 2-20) revealed a delayed
  appearance of climbing response in the PBDE 99 high-dose group. On PND 11, the
  homing test revealed a trend for treated animals, particularly the A1254 group,
  to be more active than controls. This activity level alteration was strongly
  increased on PNDs 34 and 60 in an open-field arena. On PND 60, treated mice
  showed also an altered thigmotaxis, spending more time in the centre of the
  arena than controls. At adulthood, A1254 treated mice were still hyperactive,
  whereas the PBDE 99 groups tended to be hypoactive. These findings showed that
  perinatal exposure to PBDE 99 produces several behavioural alterations and that
  its effects are not always similar to those of A1254. The possibility of
  exposure of neonates to PBDEs warrants further studies to characterise their
  developmental neurotoxicity.

AB: The levels of individual PBDE congeners were investigated in the
  invertebrate species whelk (Buccinum undatum), seastar (Asterias rubens), and
  hermit crab (Pagurus bernhardus), the gadoid fish species whiting (Merlangius
  merlangus) and cod (Gadus morhua), and the marine mammal species harbor seal
  (Phoca vitulina) and harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). These species are all
  important representatives of different trophic levels of the North Sea food
  web. All six major PBDE congeners detected (BDEs 28, 47, 99, 100, 153, and 154)
  are most prevalent in the commercial Penta-BDE formulation. There is no
  evidence for the occurrence of the Octa-BDE formulation in the North Sea food
  web, since its dominant congener, BDE183, was never detected. BDE209, the main
  congener (> 97%) in the Deca-BDE formulation, was detected only in a minority
  of the samples and always in concentrations around the limit of detection.
  Since BDE209 is often the major BDE congener in sediments from the area, the
  main reason for its low concentrations in biota from the North Sea seems to be
  a relatively low bioaccumulation potential. This can either be due to a low
  uptake rate of the very large molecule or a relatively rapid excretion after
  biotransformation. Since all invertebrates investigated are sentinel species,
  they are highly representative for the area of capture. The highest lipid
  -normalized concentrations of PBDEs in the invertebrates occurred near the
  mouth of the river Tees at the East coast of the UK. The geographical
  distribution of the PBDEs can be explained by the residual currents in the
  area. The direction of these currents differs between the summer and the winter
  season as a result of the presence or absence of vertical summer stratification
  of the deeper waters north of the Dogger Bank. Summer stratification results in
  the development of a density-driven bottom water current formed after the onset
  of vertical stratification of the water column in May leaving the UK coast near
  Flamborough Head toward the Dogger Bank. In winter, the residual currents run
  in a more southerly direction and follow the UK coastline. The distribution
  pattern of the PCBs and p,p'-DDE in the invertebrates was entirely different
  from that of the PBDEs, which could be expected, since the use of these
  organochlorines in western Europe peaked in the 1960s and 1970s but has been
  forbidden more than two decades ago, whereas the production and use of the
  penta-BDE formulation is of a more recent origin. The higher trophic levels of
  the North Sea food web were represented by the predatory gadoid fish species
  whiting and cod and the marine mammal species harbor seal and harbor porpoise.
  The lipid-normalized levels of the six major PBDE congeners in fish were
  similar to the levels in the invertebrates, but a biomagnification step in
  concentrations of generally more than an order of magnitude occurred from
  gadoid fish to marine mammals. Based on the limited number of samples, no
  differences could be observed between harbor seal and harbor porpoise. In
  summary, the results in three species of sentinel invertebrates from a network
  of stations covering a major part of the North Sea basin showed that the
  estuary of the river Tees at the UK East coast is a major source for tri- to
  hexa-PBDEs. Throughout the food-chain, the most marked increase in (lipid
  -normalized) levels of all six PBDE congeners occurred from predatory (gadoid)
  fish to marine mammals, agreeing with the transition from gill-breathing to
  lung-breathing animals. This has serious consequences for the route of
  elimination of POPs, since their elimination from the blood into the ambient
  seawater via the gill-membrane is no longer possible.

AB: AIMS: To describe presentations to emergency departments during the Sydney
  2000 Olympic Games for conditions related to the use of illicit drugs; to
  discuss the implications of such presentations for surveillance and public
  health action at similar events in the future. DESIGN: Identification of target
  presentations in sentinel emergency departments; entry of data into a purpose
  -built database; and daily electronic transfer of data for central collation
  and analysis. SETTING: Fifteen sentinel emergency departments in the greater
  Sydney metropolitan area for a 38-day period spanning the Sydney 2000 Olympic
  Games. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred and twenty-four presentations to sentinel
  emergency departments with conditions related to illicit drug use.
  MEASUREMENTS: Patient's age, sex, country and region of residence, location of
  emergency department, types of illicit drugs involved and departure status.
  FINDINGS: The mean daily number of presentations for adverse events due to
  illicit drug use was significantly higher (13.3 versus 8.8 presentations, t =
  2.2, P = 0.04) in the 2-week Olympic Games period than in the lead-up to the
  Games, culminating in a large peak following the closing ceremony. There was
  also a significant increase (5.1 versus 1.7 presentations, t = 2.8, P = 0.007)
  in the mean daily number of presentations related to use of ecstasy or
  amphetamines, whereas no change was noted in presentations related to heroin
  use. Over half (52%) of presentations occurred at two emergency departments in
  areas known as being 'hot-spots' for illicit drug use. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced
  surveillance of adverse events following illicit drug use, possibly targeting
  known 'hot-spots', should be considered for future mass events. Advance
  preparation of preventive strategies, such as 'party-safe' messages, will
  enable rapid response to unusual patterns of illicit drug-related harm during
  future mass events.

AB: In the period 1997-2000, approximately 1,800,000 m3 of material dredged from
  the Port of Leghorn was discharged into a sea dumping site located 14 miles
  from the coast. The red mullet (Mullus barbatus) was used as a bioindicator
  species for monitoring the biological impact of these discharges on a
  geographical and temporal scale. Organisms were sampled over three years (1998
  -2000) at different stations and several biomarkers, both of exposure and
  effect, were analyzed. Bioavailability of specific classes of pollutants was
  evaluated by analyzing levels of metallothioneins, the activity of cytochrome
  P450 1A (CYPIA) and of glutathione S-transferases. Among biomarkers of effect,
  special attention was paid to the balance between prooxidant challenge and
  antioxidant defenses, and to the appearance of damage caused by oxidative
  stress. The analyses of the main components of the antioxidant system included
  superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidases, glutathione reductase,
  glyoxalase I and II, and total glutathione. These data were integrated with the
  measurement of total oxyradical scavenging capacity (TOSC) as an indication of
  the overall biological resistance to toxicity of different forms of oxyradicals
  (peroxyl radicals, hydroxyl radicals and peroxynitrite). Results indicated a
  biological impact in organisms sampled near the disposal site; the impact was
  particularly evident during 1999 and mainly related to organic chemicals such
  as PAH. Exposure to these pollutants also caused variations in the levels and
  activity of several antioxidants. The analysis of TOSC, however, revealed that
  the overall capacity of specific tissues of organisms to absorb various
  oxidants was not seriously compromised when challenged with increased
  prooxidant pressures. Variations of single antioxidants were useful in
  revealing early warning "biological responses", while integration with TOSC
  analyses indicated if such changes also reflect a more integrated and
  functional "biological effect" with possible consequences at the organisms
  level. The red mullet appears to be a useful sentinel species for a biomarker
  approach to monitoring impact caused by dredged materials.

  Brief induction periods that follow high exposures in individual sentinel
  patients are a recognized indicator of impending group risk, and these periods
  call attention to the need for precautionary measures. Similarly, reports of
  short induction periods for brain cancer on the side of the head in which there
  has been prior use of cell phones may also indicate increased risk.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To provide community-level public health surveillance on alcohol
  misuse in South Africa and the associated negative consequences. METHOD: A
  descriptive, epidemiological study of alcohol use based on data gathered
  biannually from multiple sources over 4 years, including specialist treatment
  centers, trauma units, mortuaries, psychiatric facilities, and surveys of
  school students and arrestees. Networks were set up in five sentinel sites to
  facilitate the collection, interpretation and dissemination of data. RESULTS:
  Indicators point to the widespread misuse of alcohol. Alcohol consistently
  dominates the demand for substance use disorders treatment services. In the
  second half of 2000, 51.1% (Cape Town) to 77.0% (Mpumalanga) of patients
  reported alcohol as their primary substance of abuse. A high proportion of
  patients in trauma units tested positive for alcohol in 2000, ranging from
  40.3% (Durban) to 91.8% (Port Elizabeth). Similarly, a high proportion of
  mortality cases tested positive for alcohol, ranging from 40.3% (Durban) to
  67.2% (Port Elizabeth). Although treatment demand is dominated by men and older
  persons, alcohol misuse occurs among all sectors. School surveys reflect
  harmful drinking patterns among students, with 53.3% and 36.5% of male students
  in Durban and Cape Town, respectively, reporting heavy-drinking episodes by
  Grade 11. DISCUSSION: Alcohol misuse has a number of implications for public
  health policy, such as the need to develop protocols for the management of
  alcohol-positive patients in trauma units and to target prevention programs at
  heavy drinking by young people. Further monitoring of alcohol misuse and its
  associated negative consequences is required.

AB: Growing concern exists about the threats posed by environmental pollutants
  and physical agents on children's health. A number of factors, including
  globalization, increased industrialization, and trade of chemicals and poverty
  have an impact on the quality of the environment and on children's health.
  Acute toxic exposures lead to poisoning, and chronic low-level exposures may
  cause functional and organ damage during periods of special vulnerability. The
  need to protect children's environmental health is urgent, in view of the
  magnitude of the problem and the fact that "children are not little adults."
  The effects suffered during special developmental periods--"windows of
  vulnerability"--can be permanent and irreversible. The main global
  environmental problems affecting children's health are lack of access to safe
  drinking water and sanitation and exposure to indoor air pollution.
  Furthermore, environmentally related accidents, injuries, and poisonings have a
  major impact on children and adolescent's morbidity and mortality. A number of
  examples that illustrate the complexity of assessing and dealing with
  children's environmental health issues are presented. A Task Force on the
  Protection of Children's Environmental Health that aims to prevent disease and
  disability in children associated with chemical and physical threats was set up
  in 1999 by the World Health Organization. The priorities for action include the
  consideration of accidents, injuries, and poisonings (accidental, intentional,
  and occupational), and children in the workplace (e.g., scavenging children,
  children in cottage industries). Poisons Centers and related toxicology centers
  are in a strategic position to play a "sentinel" role in the protection of
  children's environmental health. They record acute and chronic toxic exposures
  in children in a harmonized manner, using controlled vocabularies and
  definitions. This will allow collecting a large, highly valuable database on
  the main toxicological problems affecting children, including those of
  environmental origin. The analysis of observations entered in such a database
  will help assess the burden of disease and collect the evidence for planning
  prevention and promoting regulatory measures. Centers are called to play a
  proactive role in raising awareness about children's environmental health and
  contribute to research, information dissemination, training, and other
  activities required for the protection of children's health and development.

  potentially genotoxic compounds is explained. Results show that the combination
  of the two techniques leads to efficient detection of the sublethal genotoxic
  effect induced in the plant bioindicator by contaminated soil. By contrast, the
  classic mortality, root, and shoot growth vegetative endpoints prove
  inappropriate for assessing soil genotoxicity because, although they cause
  genotoxic damage, some heavy metals do not affect sentinel plant development
  negatively. The statistical elaboration of the data obtained led to the
  development of a statistical predictive model which differentiates four
  different levels of soil genotoxic pollution and can be used everywhere. The
  second part deals with the application of the biomonitoring protocol in the
  genotoxic assessment of two areas surrounding a steelworks in northern Italy
  and the effectiveness of this methodology. In this particular case, in these
  areas, the predictive model reveals a pollution level strictly correlated to
  the heavy metal concentrations revealed by traditional chemical analysis.

AB: This paper briefly reviews the application of histopathology as aninstrument
  or endpoint in toxicity studies in fish. For long this has been applied rather
  occasionally in (regulatory) toxicology, and was mainly of interest in
  fundamental studies and limited carcinogenicity experiments. However, nowadays
  there are various incentives that ask for the application of pathology, such as
  field monitoring of pollution effects, the wish for optimal use and lower
  species of laboratory animals, the availability of modern histology techniques,
  and insight and interest in mechanistic data. This is timely illustrated by the
  current broad interest in endocrine disrupting pollutants - a threat mainly in
  the aquatic environment - where histopathological organ and tissue changes in
  intact sentinel fish species provide pivotal diagnostic and mechanistic
  features.

AB: Under controlled conditions we exposed eggs of 17 potential host taxa
  representing five orders and 14 families to females of Trichogramma platneri
  Nagarkatti, an egg parasitoid used as an inundative biological control agent
  against codling moth, Cydia pomonella L. (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae).
  Trichogramma platneri successfully parasitized species from five lepidopteran
  families (Gelechiidae, Noctuidae, Pyralidae, Sphingidae, Tortricidae) and the
  green lacewing, Chrysoperla carnea Stephens (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae). Female
  wasps spent more time on heavier host eggs and the probability of successful
  parasitism was related to the structural integrity of the chorion of the host
  egg. We observed oviposition attempts on all other lepidopteran hosts offered
  and on eggs of Geocoris punctipes Say (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae) and Nezara
  viridula L. (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae). Dipteran and coleopteran eggs were not
  attacked. Sentinel eggs of the six physiologically acceptable hosts were
  exposed in a walnut orchard in California during inundative releases of T.
  platneri and all hosts were attacked equally. Parasitoids were also equally
  active at all heights from 1.5 to 6.5 m within the orchard canopy. Inundative
  releases of T. platneri may impact naturally occurring populations of green
  lacewings within walnut orchards, and have the potential to impact nontarget
  lepidopteran populations within the release area.

AB: Muscle concentrations of organochlorinated compounds as well as biliary
  levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) metabolites were determined in
  red mullet Mullus barbatus as a sentinel species for assessing the pollution
  along the western Mediterranean coast. A battery of biochemical markers -
  biotransformation and antioxidant enzymes - were also measured in liver
  subcellular fractions to assess exposure to pollutants. Among them, 7
  -ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity, as well as 7-penthoxyresorufin O
  -deethylase (PROD) activity and cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) content evidenced
  strong differences among sampling sites, and a good correlation with the amount
  of PCBs bioaccumulated by fish. No clear pollution-related response was
  observed for cytosolic glutathione S-transferase, whereas uridine-diphosphate
  UDP-glucuronyltransferase (UDPGT) was elevated in fish from polluted sites.
  Antioxidant enzymes - superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and glutathione
  peroxidase (GPX) - were used to assess oxidative stress. Among them, catalase
  activity was well related to PCB body burden.

AB: Two species of bivalves, Mya arenaria and Mactromeris polynyma, were exposed
  to contaminated marine sediments from Baie des Anglais, Quebec, for a period of
  10 and 12 weeks, respectively, in order to determine if there was an effect on
  the phagocytic activity of hemocytes from each species. These sediments contain
  elevated levels of both PAHs and PCBs. Uncontaminated beach sand was used as
  control sediments. After a period of 4 weeks, each species of bivalves were
  sampled and hemocyte phagocytic activity was monitored by flow cytometry. While
  phagocytosis by hemocytes from M. polynyma was significantly suppressed, those
  from M. arenaria were not different from beach sand-exposed controls. At the
  end of the exposure period, the phagocytic activity of hemocytes from both
  species was suppressed. Physiological parameters such as mantle proteins or
  malondialdehyde levels, total protein and total glycogen levels in the
  digestive gland were not affected by exposure to contaminated sediments.
  Moreover, the suppression of phagocytosis was well correlated with the transfer
  of contaminants from the sediments to the bivalves and their subsequent
  bioaccumulation, as demonstrated by the PCB body burden. These results support
  the use of bivalves as good sentinel species to survey sediment contamination
  and the usefulness of hemocyte phagocytic activity as a sensitive biomarker of
  exposure to organic contaminants.

AB: Iodine-129 is routinely released in the gaseous and liquid low-level
  radioactive effluents of nuclear spent fuel reprocessing plants. Environmental
  impact assessment of these discharges are performed based on monitoring samples
  of different types of natural indicators. Thyroid is considered as a relevant
  organ to monitor radioactive iodine isotopes. In this study, bovine thyroids
  were collected in herds located in the Cotentin area under the influence of
  authorized low level gaseous effluents of the La Hague nuclear fuel
  -reprocessing plant. For low level super(129)I/ super(127)I ratios,
  characteristic of environmental samples (10 super(-12) to 10 super(-7)), RNAA
  or SMA that includes important radiochemical preparation steps are used. This
  paper demonstrates the interest of direct gamma -X spectrometry to measure
  super(129)I activities, associated to INAA to measure super(127)I to attain
  higher ratios levels (10 super(-6) to 10 super(-4)). This study shows the
  interest of monitoring bovine thyroids considered as sentinel organs to
  characterize the dispersion in space and time of super(129)I discharged in low
  level radioactive gaseous effluents by the La Hague reprocessing plant.

AB: Cancerbioassays have demonstrated the carcinogenic activity of vinyl acetate
  in rodents. Tumors appear only at the site of contact and mechanistic data
  suggest that the carcinogenic mechanism involves carboxylesterase-mediated
  metabolism of vinyl acetate to acetic acid. It has been hypothesized that
  intracellular formation of acetate causes a reduction of intracellular pH (pH
  sub(i)) at noncytotoxic levels, but that prolonged exposure to reduced pH
  sub(i) is cytotoxic and/or mitogenic and drives proliferative responses.
  Coupled with exposure to metabolically formed acetaldehyde at high administered
  concentrations, nonlinear dose-response curves for epithelial tumors are
  produced. Freshly isolated rat hepatocytes were used as a model system to test
  the concept that exposure of cells to vinyl acetate causes a reduction in pH
  sub(i). Quantitative fluorescence imaging ratio microscopy showed that exposure
  of hepatocytes to vinyl acetate concentrations ranging from 10 to 1000 mu M
  caused rapid and sustained reductions of approximately 0.03 to 0.65 pH units.
  Cellular acidification was rapidly reversed to control pH sub(i) upon removal
  of vinyl acetate. There was minimal accumulation of protons during the exposure
  period, as suggested by minor differences in pH sub(i) of cells with or without
  prior exposure to vinyl acetate. The effect of vinyl acetate on pH sub(i) was
  attenuated by prior exposure to the carboxylesterase inhibitor bis(p
  -nitrophenyl)phosphate. These results support the concept that intracellular
  acidification is a sentinel pharmacodynamic response of cells to vinyl acetate
  exposure and that pH sub(i) is an appropriate metric dose for use in
  quantitative risk assessments of cancer and noncancer human health risk
  assessment.

AB: As sensitive and ecologically relevant measures of environmental conditions,
  bioindicators can be used to assess the health of aquatic ecosystems which may
  be compromised by a variety of environmental stressors such as contaminants,
  sediments, nutrients, and varying temperature, salinity, and hydrologic
  regimes. The bioindicators approach is a proven bioassessment method that uses
  responses of key (sentinel) aquatic organisms both as integrators of stress
  effects and as sensitive response (early-warning) indicators of environmental
  health. This integrated approach involves measuring a suite of selected
  biological and ecological responses at several levels of biological
  organization from the biomolecular and biochemical to the community levels.
  When properly designed and applied in field situations, bioindicator studies
  can help identify causal mechanisms between environmental stressors and
  population and community-level effects, and serve as a basis for which the
  effectiveness of remedial actions on the health of aquatic organisms can be
  evaluated. Rapidly-responding sensitive biomarkers, such as biomolecular and
  biochemical responses, and slower-response ecologically relevant bioindicators,
  such as population and community responses, can be included in field
  bioassessment programs to provide measurement endpoints for use in
  environmental compliance, regulatory decision-making, and ecological risk
  assessments. This bioindicators approach should be particularly relevant in
  helping to identify and diagnose sources of stressors in environments impacted
  by multiple stressors. To demonstrate use of bioindicators in addressing water
  quality issues, spatial and temporal patters in various biological responses
  are related to spatial and temporal patterns of contaminants in two aquatic
  systems compromised by different stressors.

AB: The area of free radical biology is of increasing interest for marine
  organisms since the enhanced formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a
  common pathway of toxicity induced by stressful environmental conditions. In
  polar environments responses of the antioxidant system could be useful as an
  early detection biomarkers of unforeseen effects of human activities which are
  progressively increasing in these remote areas. However, the characterization
  of antioxidant defences in appropriate sentinel species is of particular value
  also in terms of a possible adaptation to this extreme environment. The
  scallop, Adamussium colbecki, is a key species for monitoring the Antarctic
  environment and, besides single antioxidants, the total oxyradical scavenging
  capacity (TOSC) assay has been recently used for quantifying the overall
  ability of this organism to neutralize peroxyl radicals (ROO super( times )),
  hydroxyl radicals ( super( times )OH) and peroxynitrite (HOONO). The aim of
  this work was to obtain a better characterization of these biological responses
  which can indicate the occurrence of biological disturbance; in this study the
  total oxyradical scavenging capacity was further analyzed to assess the
  presence of seasonal fluctuations in the susceptibility to oxidatives stress in
  this species. The capability to neutralize peroxyl radicals and hydroxyl
  radicals increased at the end of December, while resistance towards
  peroxynitrite did not show any significant variations during the Antarctic
  summer. These results suggest the occurrence of metabolic changes which mainly
  influence intracellular formation of ROO super( times ) and super( times )OH,
  with more limited effects on HOONO. Despite the limited time window analyzed,
  as a typical constraint in Antarctic research at Terra Nova Bay, an increased
  resistance to these specific oxyradicals might be related to the period of
  highest feeding activity, or to other intrinsic factors in the animals'
  physiology such as the phase of reproductive cycle.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the epidemiology of symptomatic human pesticide
  exposures using poison control center data and geographic information systems.
  METHODS: All symptomatic human pesticide exposures reported to the poison
  center during the period from January 1 to December 31, 2000 were included for
  analysis using geographic information systems. A space-time scan statistic was
  utilized to evaluate for clustering of symptomatic human exposures. RESULTS: Of
  322 symptomatic pesticide exposures, 297 (92%) contained spatial identifiers
  that could be further analyzed using geographic information systems. A spatial
  and temporal cluster of symptomatic pesticide exposures was identified during
  the periodfrom April 1 to August 31, 2000, covering a large geographic area of
  eastern and predominantly rural regions of the state. The relative risk of
  reporting a symptomatic pesticide exposure among individuals living within this
  geographic area was 1.8 (log likelihood ratio = 18.5, P = 0.0005). CONCLUSIONS:
  Geographic information systems can be effectively utilized by poison control
  centers to study regional and temporal variation in the incidence of human
  pesticide exposures. With the collection of more specific spatial identifiers,
  geographic information systems may have many additional applications in the
  surveillance and prevention of pesticide and other sentinel event exposures.

AB: North Florida is a transition zone between widespread Culex nigripalpus
  populations to the south and focal Culex salinarius populations to the north.
  Culex nigripalpus is a vector of St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) and eastern
  equine encephalitis (EEE) viruses in south Florida, while Cx. salinarius is a
  suspected New World vector of West Nile (WN) virus. Abundant vector populations
  are often a prerequisite for epidemic and epizootic transmission of
  arboviruses. Extensive SLE transmission has never been reported from north
  Florida, but sporadic WN transmission was reported there during the summer of
  2001. The disparate flavivirus transmission patterns observed in north and
  south Florida may be due, in part, to the local geographical and seasonal
  distribution of Culex vectors. Here we report that from May 1991 to April 1994,
  Cx. salinarius was most commonly observed during the winter and spring in
  northeast Florida (Duval County), whereas Cx. nigripalpus was most abundant
  during the summer and autumn. An unusually mild spring in 1991 allowed Cx.
  nigripalpus to reproduce early in the year, resulting in a summer population
  that emerged more than 8 wks earlier than in 1992 and 1993. The 1991 Cx.
  nigripalpus population persisted through October, when SLE transmission was
  detected by sentinel chickens. Transmission of SLE was not detected in Duval
  County during 1992 or 1993. These data indicate that mild winter and spring
  conditions in north Florida may favor increased abundance and survival of Cx.
  nigripalpus in a region where this species is normally not abundant. A seasonal
  shift in population structure may increase the transmission risk of arboviruses
  for which Cx. nigripalpus is a competent vector, including SLE, WN, and EEE.

AB: OBJECTIVES: Condylomata acuminata (or genital warts) are sexually
  transmitted diseases caused by human papillomavirus. Until now, there has been
  no available epidemiologic data about this disease in France. We conducted a
  prospective study among French general practitioners (GPs) to estimate the
  incidence of consultations for external condylomata acuminata in general
  practice. We also assessed the management of patients with external condylomata
  acuminata by French GP's. DESIGN: A panel of French general practitioners,
  members of the Sentinel network, had to fill-in prospectively a questionnaire
  for each patient with condylomata acuminata diagnosed between July and November
  2000. RESULTS: The annual number of consultations for external condylomata
  acuminata with French GP's was estimated at 23,000 (CI (95 p. 100) 21,000
  -25,000) including 15,000 new cases (CI (95 p. 100) 13,000-17,000). Taking into
  account the estimations we made at the same time in office-based private
  dermatologists, we estimated the annual incidence of external condylomata
  acuminata in France at 107/100 000 inhabitants. The management of patients with
  external condylomata acuminata by French GP's was in accordance with the
  European guidelines in 54 to 78 p. 100 of cases. French GP's mostly prescribed
  chemical treatment. DISCUSSION: A proportion of cases of condylomata acuminata
  may have not been diagnosed. Similarly, some lesions may have been wrongly
  diagnosed as condylomata acuminata, but these proportions of false positive and
  false negative remain unknown. The incidence of external condylomata acuminata
  in France is similar to those estimated in others developed countries.

AB: The setting up of efficient early warning systems is a challenge to research
  for preventing environmental alteration and human disease. In this paper, we
  report the development and the field application of a new biomonitoring
  methodology for assessing soil genotoxicity. In the first part, the use of
  amplified fragment length polymorphism and flow cytometry techniques to detect
  DNA damage induced by soils artificially contaminated with heavy metals as
  potentially genotoxic compounds is explained. Results show that the combination
  of the two techniques leads to efficient detection of the sublethal genotoxic
  effect induced in the plant bioindicator by contaminated soil. By contrast, the
  classic mortality, root, and shoot growth vegetative endpoints prove
  inappropriate for assessing soil genotoxicity because, although they cause
  genotoxic damage, some heavy metals do not affect sentinel plant development
  negatively. The statistical elaboration of the data obtained led to the
  development of a statistical predictive model which differentiates four
  different levels of soil genotoxic pollution and can be used everywhere. The
  second part deals with the application of the biomonitoring protocol in the
  genotoxic assessment of two areas surrounding a steelworks in northern Italy
  and the effectiveness of this methodology. In this particular case, in these
  areas, the predictive model reveals a pollution level strictly correlated to
  the heavy metal concentrations revealed by traditional chemical analysis.

  (PFHxS; C6F13SO3-), and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA; C7F15CO2-) were measured in
  livers of mink and river otters collected from various locations in the United
  States. PFOS was found in all mink livers analyzed. Frequencies of occurrence
  of FOSA, PFHxS, and PFOA were less. The greatest concentration of PFOS measured
  in liver of mink was 5140 ng/g, wet weight. Maximum concentrations of FOSA,
  PFHxS, and PFOA in mink livers were 590, 39, and 27 ng/g, wet weight,
  respectively. There were no significant positive relationships between
  concentrations of PFOS and PFHxS or PFOA in mink livers. Concentrations of PFOS
  were positively correlated with those of FOSA in mink livers from Illinois.
  There was no significant correlation between concentrations of PFOS and lipid
  content in mink livers. There were no age- or sex-related differences in the
  concentrations of fluorochemicals in mink livers. Greater concentrations are
  associated with those individuals collected near urbanized and/or
  industrialized areas. PFOS was detected in livers of all river otters collected
  from Washington and Oregon at concentrations ranging from 25 to 994 ng/g, wet
  wt.

AB: The presence of toxic substances in the Great Lakes (GL) basin continues to
  be a significant concern. In the United States, some 70,000 commercial and
  industrial compounds are now in use. More than 30,000 are produced or used in
  the Great Lakes ecosystem. These substances include organochlorines (e.g.,
  polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, furans, dieldrin, etc.), heavy
  metals such as methylmercury, and alkylated lead, and polycyclic aromatic
  hydrocarbons (e.g., benzo[a]pyrene). The IJC has identified 42 locations in the
  GL basin of the United States and Canada as Areas of Concern (AOCs) because of
  high concentrations of these toxic substances. In 1990 the U.S. Congress
  amended the Great Lakes Critical Programs Act to create The Agency for Toxic
  Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) Great Lakes Human Health Effects
  Research Program (GLHHERP) to begin to address these issues. This program
  characterizes exposures to contaminants via consumption of GL fish and
  investigates the potential for short- and long-term adverse health effects.
  This paper reviews the GLHHERP program and indicators established to monitor
  and address the risks posed by these substances to vulnerable populations in
  the Great Lakes ecosystem.

AB: The measurement of contaminant tissue concentrations or exposure-related
  effects in biota has been used extensively to monitor pollution and
  environmental health. Terrestrial vertebrates have historically been an
  important group of species in such evaluations, not only because many are
  excellent sentinels of environmental contamination, but also because they are
  valued natural resources in their own right that may be adversely affected by
  toxicant exposure. Selection of appropriate vertebrates for biomonitoring
  studies frequently relies on expert opinion, although a few rigorous schemes
  are in use for predicting vulnerability of birds to the adverse effects of
  petroleum crude oil. A Utility Index that ranks terrestrial vertebrate species
  as potential sentinels of contaminants in a region, and a Vulnerability Index
  that assesses the threat of specific groups of contaminants to these species,
  have been developed to assist decision makers in risk assessments of persistent
  organic pollutants, cholinesterase-inhibiting pesticides, petroleum crude oil,
  mercury, and lead shot. Twenty-five terrestrial vertebrate species commonly
  found in Atlantic Coast estuarine habitat (Rattner et al. 2001a) were ranked
  for their utility as biomonitors of contamination and their vulnerability to
  pollutants in this region. No single species, taxa, or class of vertebrates was
  found to be an ideal sentinel for all groups of contaminants. Although birds
  have overwhelmingly been used to monitor contaminants compared to other
  terrestrial vertebrate classes, the nonmigratory nature and dietary habits of
  the snapping turtle and mink consistently resulted in ranking these species as
  excellent sentinels as well. Vulnerability of Atlantic Coast populations of
  these species varied considerably among groups of contaminants. Usually a
  particular species was found to be at high risk to only one or two groups of
  contaminants, although a noteworthy exception is the bald eagle, which is
  highly vulnerable to all five of the contaminant groups examined. This index
  could be further enhanced by generation of additional comparative toxicity data
  to facilitate interspecific extrapolations. The Utility and Vulnerability
  Indices have application to many types of habitats in addition to estuaries and
  are of value to natural resource and risk managers that routinely conduct
  local, regional, or national environmental quality assessments.

AB: In 2000, the OzFoodNet network was established to enhance surveillance of
  foodborne diseases across Australia. OzFoodNet consists of 7 sites and covers
  68 per cent of Australia's population. During 2001, sites reported 15,815 cases
  of campylobacteriosis, 6,607 cases of salmonellosis, 326 cases of shigellosis,
  71 cases of yersiniosis, 61 cases of listeriosis, 47 cases of shiga-toxin
  producing E. coli and 5 cases of haemolytic uraemic syndrome. Sites reported 86
  foodborne outbreaks affecting 1,768 people, of whom 4.0 per cent (70/1,768)
  were hospitalised and one person died. There was a wide range of foods
  implicated in these outbreaks and the most common agent was S. Typhimurium.
  Sites reported two international outbreaks; one of multi-drug resistant S.
  Typhimurium Definitive Type 104 due to helva imported from Turkey, and one of
  S. Stanley associated with dried peanuts from China. The National Centre for
  Epidemiology and Population Health conducted a national survey of
  gastroenteritis. Preliminary data from interviews of 2,417 people suggests that
  the incidence of foodborne illness is significantly higher than previously
  thought. OzFoodNet initiated case control studies into risk factors for
  Campylobacter, Salmonella, Listeria, and shiga-toxin producing E. coli.
  OzFoodNet developed a foodborne disease outbreak register for Australia;
  established a network of laboratories to type Campylobacter; prepared a survey
  of pathology laboratories; reviewed Australian data on listeriosis; and
  assessed the usefulness of sentinel surveillance for gastroenteritis. This
  program of enhanced surveillance has demonstrated its capacity to nationally
  investigate and determine the causes of foodborne disease.

AB: A histopathological assessment of the gonad of male fish was performed as
  part of biological field studies carried out in coastal waters and small rivers
  in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, northeastern Germany. In the marine
  environment the eelpout (Zoarces viviparus) was selected as sentinel species.
  The three spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and perch (Perca
  fluviatilis) were chosen at freshwater locations. Histopathology of the testis
  revealed the presence of intersexuality in specimens of all three species. The
  intersex condition was defined by the simultaneous presence of primary oocytes
  within the apparently normal testis tissue. In comparison to stickleback and
  perch the eelpout exhibited the highest intersex prevalence and the most severe
  histological alterations. Fish with intersex were found at contaminated marine
  and freshwater stations as well as at sites with apparently little pollution.
  The findings suggest that feminised male fish were exposed to endocrine
  disrupting substances in the aquatic environment.

AB: The presence of chemical contaminants in marine coastal waters is a major
  subject of concern since many molecules are potentially immunotoxic, even at
  low concentration. During the last decade, studies in sentinel species, such as
  the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, or the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, have
  revealed that immunosuppressive responses can be related to xenobiotic
  exposure, in the laboratory and in the field. In the present study, European
  flat oysters were experimentally exposed to heavy metals, to investigate
  possible alterations of their immune function. Several hematological and
  functional parameters of hemocytes were measured by flow cytometry, a technique
  allowing rapid, sensitive, cell-by-cell measurements in large cell populations.
  Results reveal a depression of phagocytosis and several subcellular,
  physiological changes in oysters exposed to cadmium alone or to cadmium and
  copper, suggesting an overall alteration of the phagocytic function.

AB: BACKGROUND: Methylene blue dye (MBD) is being used as an alternative to
  isosulfan blue dye in sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsies for breast cancer
  patients. Complications using MBD for SLN localization have not previously been
  reported. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted of 24 consecutive
  patients who received MBD. Patients were given 3 to 5 cc of 1% MBD as
  peritumoral injections within the breast parenchyma and intradermally. Patients
  who developed local skin lesions at the injection site were queried regarding
  lesion appearance and when subsequent adjuvant therapy was initiated. RESULTS:
  Five of the 24 patients (21%) developed skin lesions at the injection site.
  Intradermal injections were discontinued, and only deep parenchymal injections
  were performed. All 5 patients had improvement of their skin lesions with
  silver sulfadiazine cream and no patient required debridement. Each patient
  received adjuvant therapy after surgery without delay. CONCLUSIONS: Our
  institution has experienced patients who developed skin lesions at the MBD
  injection site when using combined deep parenchymal and intradermal injections.
  With the increased use of MBD, caution should be used to avoid intradermal
  injections with SLN localization.

AB: AIMS: Presence of axillary lymph node metastases is considered the most
  important prognostic factor for breast cancer survival. In a period of
  increasing popularity for the sentinel node procedure, clarity about the
  possible relation between axillary dissection and survival is essential. This
  study investigated whether the total number of removed lymph nodes and the
  ratio of invaded/removed lymph nodes (lymph node ratio (LNR) would prove to be
  independent prognostic factors for survival. METHODS: Data from 453 consecutive
  patients with stage I or II breast cancer were studied retrospectively. The
  total number of removed lymph nodes and the LNR were analysed for their
  prognostic value in comparison with known prognostic factors. RESULTS: Node
  -negative patients with < 14 lymph nodes removed had a 10 year survival of 79%
  compared with 89% in patients with > or = 14 lymph nodes removed (P=0.005). The
  10 year survival for patients with an LNR > or = 0.2 was 52%, compared with 73%
  for patients with an LNR < 0.2 (P<0.0001). A Cox proportional hazards model
  showed that, for node-negative patients, only age and total number of removed
  lymph nodes were significant prognostic factors. For node-positive patients,
  age, total number of removed lymph nodes and the LNR were significant risk
  factors for survival outcome. The LNR was also significantly associated with
  the presence of distant metastases during follow-up (hazard ratio 3.56, range
  1.63-7.77). CONCLUSIONS: In stage I and II breast cancer, a favourable
  prognosis was found for node-negative patients with > or = 14 removed lymph
  nodes. Before axillary lymph node dissection with its well-defined survival
  prognosis is replaced by less invasive staging methods, long-term survival
  using new staging techniques needs to be defined. For node-positive patients,
  the LNR proved to be an excellent predictor for survival outcome or development
  of metastatic disease. Selection of lymph node-positive patients based on the
  LNR may guide specific adjuvant treatment choices.

AB: Preventing campylobacteriosis depends on a thorough understanding of its
  epidemiology. We used case-case analysis to compare cases of Campylobacter coli
  infection with cases of C. jejuni infection, to generate hypotheses for
  infection from standardized, population-based sentinel surveillance information
  in England and Wales. Persons with C. coli infection were more likely to have
  drunk bottled water than were those with C. jejuni infection and, in general,
  were more likely to have eaten pate. Important differences in exposures were
  identified for these two Campylobacter species. Exposures that are a risk for
  infection for both comparison groups might not be identified or might be
  underestimated by case-case analysis. Similarly, the magnitude or direction of
  population risk cannot be assessed accurately. Nevertheless, our findings
  suggest that case-control studies should be conducted at the species level.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To review recent advances in radiation therapy in treatment of
  breast cancer. QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: MEDLINE and CANCERLIT were searched using
  the MeSH words breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ, sentinel lymph node
  biopsy, and postmastectomy radiation. Randomized studies have shown the
  efficacy of radiation treatment for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and for
  invasive breast cancer. MAIN MESSAGE: Lumpectomy followed by radiation is
  effective treatment for DCIS. In early breast cancer, shorter radiation
  schedules are as efficacious for local control and short-term cosmetic results
  as traditional fractionation regimens. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is done in
  specialized cancer centres; regional radiation is recommended for patients with
  four or more positive axillary lymph nodes. Postmastectomy radiation has been
  shown to have survival benefits for high-risk premenopausal patients. Systemic
  metastases from breast cancer usually respond satisfactorily to radiation.
  CONCLUSION: Radiation therapy continues to have an important role in treatment
  of breast cancer. There have been great advances in radiation therapy in the
  last decade, but they have raised controversy. Further studies are needed to
  address the controversies.

AB: The area of free radical biology is of increasing interest for marine
  organisms since the enhanced formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a
  common pathway of toxicity induced by stressful environmental conditions. In
  polar environments responses of the antioxidant system could be useful as an
  early detection biomarkers of unforeseen effects of human activities which are
  progressively increasing in these remote areas. However, the characterization
  of antioxidant defences in appropriate sentinel species is of particular value
  also in terms of a possible adaptation to this extreme environment. The
  scallop, Adamussium colbecki, is a key species for monitoring the Antarctic
  environment and, besides single antioxidants, the total oxyradical scavenging
  capacity (TOSC) assay has been recently used for quantifying the overall
  ability of this organism to neutralize peroxyl radicals (ROO*), hydroxyl
  radicals (*OH) and peroxynitrite (HOONO). The aim of this work was to obtain a
  better characterization of these biological responses which can indicate the
  occurrence of biological disturbance; in this study the total oxyradical
  scavenging capacity was further analyzed to assess the presence of seasonal
  fluctuations in the susceptibility to oxidative stress in this species. The
  capability to neutralize peroxyl radicals and hydroxyl radicals increased at
  the end of December, while resistance towards peroxynitrite did not show any
  significant variations during the Antarctic summer. These results suggest the
  occurrence of metabolic changes which mainly influence intracellular formation
  of ROO* and *OH, with more limited effects on HOONO. Despite the limited time
  window analyzed, as a typical constraint in Antarctic research at Terra Nova
  Bay, an increased resistance to these specific oxyradicals might be related to
  the period of highest feeding activity, or to other intrinsic factors in the
  animals' physiology such as the phase of reproductive cycle.

AB: Acute effects of the endocrine disruptor bis(tri-n-butyltin) oxide (TBTO) on
  molting-hormone biosynthesis and imaginal-disc development were investigated in
  larvae of the midge Chironomus riparius (Meigen). Ecdysteroid synthesis was
  measured by 24-h incubation of molting-hormone-synthesizing tissues
  (prothoracic glands) in vitro with or without the addition of TBTO. The amount
  of ecdysteroids produced was analyzed by radioimmunoassay. Developmental
  effects in vivo were investigated by determining the developmental phase of the
  genital imaginal discs before and after a 48-h exposure to TBTO in water. Sex
  -specific effects were found with both endpoints. Ecdysteroid synthesis was
  significantly reduced (analysis of variance [ANOVA], p < or = 0.005) in female
  larvae at all concentrations (TBTO-Sn at 50, 500, and 5,000 ng/L), whereas a
  significant elevation of the biosynthesis rate occurred in male larvae in the
  500-ng/L treatment (ANOVA, p < or = 0.05). In vivo experiments with development
  of the genital imaginal disc within a 48-h exposure period revealed a
  significantly slower development in female larvae and a significantly faster
  development in male larvae (contingency tables, p < or = 0.001) at all
  concentrations tested (TBTO-Sn at 10, 50, 200, and 1,000 ng/L). These results
  partly coincided with the in vitro effects on molting-hormone synthesis. The 48
  -h median lethal concentration (LC50) was 25 microg/L (20-30 microg/L 95%
  confidence intervals). The combination of in vitro and in vivo methods has
  proven to be a useful approach for the detection of endocrine effects of TBTO
  in C. riparius at levels 2,000-fold below the LC50 value. High sensitivity and
  short test duration suggest that chironomids may have potential as freshwater
  sentinel organisms for endocrine-disrupting chemicals.

AB: This paper reviews the Twenty-fourth Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer
  Symposium. The preliminary results of the ATAC study have shown that Arimidex
  is superior to tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with ER-positive early breast
  cancer in terms of DFS, adverse effects and prevention of contralateral breast
  cancer. However, longer follow up is required to assess the drug safety
  regarding bone mineral density and cognitive function. Letrozole seems to be
  superior to tamoxifen as a first-line therapy in ER-positive advanced breast
  cancer in postmenopausal women. Although the incidence of acute myeloid
  leukaemia is significantly increased (cumulative incidence at 5 years = 1.1%)
  in breast cancer patients receiving cyclophosphamide and anthracyclines, the
  risk of this complication is easily outweighed by the benefits of chemotherapy.
  Adjuvant clodronate was found to be associated with a significant reduction in
  the incidence of bone metastases during the treatment period. A randomised
  trial comparing axillary dissection and axillary radiotherapy (RT) for early
  breast cancer reported no significant difference in survival at 15 years.
  However, axillary recurrence was significantly increased in the RT group. hTERT
  protein expression by IHC was found to correlate significantly with breast
  cancer-specific survival. There is no evidence to support the use of IHC of the
  sentinel node in routine clinical practice. LCIS is currently considered as a
  non-obligate precursor to breast cancer rather than just a risk factor.

AB: Exposure to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), an important cofactor in the etiology of
  hepatocellular carcinoma in Taiwan, is influenced by dietary and other factors.
  The present study examined the intraindividual variability in AFB1-albumin
  adducts, the most reliable long-term biomarker of AFB1 exposure, and whether
  the baseline or follow-up adduct levels and the intraindividual variability in
  adduct levels are modified by endogenous and environmental factors. The study
  measured AFB1-albumin adduct levels among 264 healthy male residents of three
  townships (Hu-Hsi, Ma-Kung, and Pai-Hsa) of Penghu Islets, Taiwan, at two
  different time points with a median interval of 1.68 years (range 1.00-3.17
  years). There was a generalized reduction in the adduct levels, with the median
  values being 22.1 pmol/mg (range 5.0-355.8 pmol/mg) at time 1 and 14.3 pmol/mg
  (range 5.0-205.2 pmol/mg) at time 2. This intraindividual variability in adduct
  levels was inversely associated with the age of subjects and the time interval
  between the two blood draws. The variability in adduct levels was lower among
  subjects in Hu-Hsi and Pai-Hsa townships as compared to those in Ma-Kung. No
  significant association was observed for the intraindividual variability in
  AFB1-albumin adducts with regard to the season when blood was drawn. There was
  also no significant association between intraindividual variability and
  hepatitis B surface antigen, anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV), glutathione S
  -transferase (GST) M1, or GSTT1 status. In conclusion, we found substantial
  intraindividual variability in the AFB1 exposure (as determined by AFB1-albumin
  adducts) in Taiwan, which was probably more likely related to dietary or other
  environmental influences rather than to endogenous factors (e.g., hepatitis B/C
  viral infection or GST M1/T1 genetic status).

AB: PROBLEM/CONDITION: Silicosis is an occupational respiratory disease caused
  by the inhalation of respirable dust containing crystalline silica. Public
  health surveillance programs to identify workers at risk for silicosis and
  target workplace-specific and other prevention efforts are currently being
  field-tested in seven U.S. states. REPORTING PERIOD COVERED: Confirmed cases
  ascertained by state health departments during the period January 1, 1993,
  through December 31, 1993; the cases and associated workplaces were followed
  through December 1994. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEMS: As part of the Sentinel Event
  Notification System for Occupational Risks (SENSOR) program initiated by CDC's
  National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), development of
  state-based surveillance and intervention programs for silicosis was initiated
  in 1987 in Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio, and Wisconsin and in 1992 in Illinois,
  North Carolina, and Texas. RESULTS: From January 1, 1993, through December 2,
  1994, the SENSOR silicosis programs in Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, North
  Carolina, Ohio, Texas, and Wisconsin confirmed 256 cases of silicosis that were
  initially ascertained in 1993. Overall, 185 (72%) were initially identified
  through review of hospital discharge data or through hospital reports of
  silicosis diagnoses; 188 (73%) were associated with silica exposure in
  manufacturing industries (e.g., foundries; stone, clay, glass, and concrete
  manufacturers; and industrial and commercial machinery manufacture). Overall,
  42 (16%) cases were associated with silica exposure from sandblasting
  operations. Among the 193 confirmed cases for which information was available
  about duration of employment in jobs with potential exposure to silica, 37
  (19%) were employed < or = 10 years in such jobs and 156 (81%) were employed >
  or = 11 years. A total of 192 primary workplaces associated with potentially
  hazardous silica exposures were identified for the 256 confirmed silicosis
  cases. Of these, nine (5%) workplaces were inspected by state health department
  (SHD) industrial hygienists, 19 (10%) were referred to the Occupational Safety
  and Health Administration (OSHA) for follow-up, and seven (4%) were routinely
  monitored by the Mine Safety and Health Administration. Of the 157 (82%)
  remaining workplaces, follow-up activities determined that 82 were no longer in
  operation, eight were no longer using silica, 18 were assigned a lower priority
  for follow-up, six were associated with building trades and could not be
  inspected because of the transient nature of work in the construction industry,
  and 43 workplaces were not inspected for other reasons. Fourteen (7%) of the
  192 workplaces were inspected. At 10 of the 14 workplaces, airborne levels of
  crystalline silica were measured; in nine, silica levels exceeded the NIOSH
  -recommended exposure level of 0.05 mg/m, and in six, airborne silica levels
  also exceeded federal permissible exposure limits. ACTIONS TAKEN: Employee
  -specific and other preventive interventions have been initiated in response to
  reported cases. In addition, special silicosis prevention projects have been
  initiated in Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, and Wisconsin.
  To facilitate the implementation of silicosis surveillance by other states,
  efforts are ongoing to identify and standardize core data needed by
  surveillance programs to describe cases and the workplaces where exposure
  occurred. These core variables will be incorporated into a user-friendly
  software system that states can use for data collection and reporting.

AB: PROBLEM/CONDITION: A case of occupational asthma is a sentinel health event
  indicating a need for preventive intervention. REPORTING PERIOD COVERED: 1988
  -1992. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEMS: As part of the Sentinel Event Notification
  System for Occupational Risks (SENSOR) Program, initiated by CDC's National
  Institute for Occupational Safety and Health in 1987, state-based surveillance
  and intervention programs for occupational asthma (OA) have been under
  development in Michigan and New Jersey. The initial 5-year projects in these
  states have been completed. RESULTS: From 1988 through 1992, the SENSOR
  programs in these states identified a total of 535 cases of occupational asthma
  and related conditions. Of these 535 cases, 328 cases met the SENSOR
  surveillance case definition for OA. In addition, 128 cases were classified as
  possible OA, 42 as reactive airways dysfunction syndrome, and 37 as
  occupationally aggravated asthma. In both Michigan and New Jersey,
  manufacturing was the industrial sector with the largest proportion of cases.
  In Michigan, > 40% of the case-patients worked in transportation equipment
  manufacturing. In New Jersey, 15% of case-patients worked in manufacturing of
  chemicals and allied products. Overall, isocyanates were the most frequently
  reported asthma-causing agents (19.4% of cases). Follow-up industrial hygiene
  sampling measured suspect agents at airborne concentrations generally below the
  permissible exposure limits established by the Occupational Safety and Health
  Administration. INTERPRETATION: In its first 5 years, the SENSOR system has led
  to the identification of previously unrecognized causes of occupational asthma.
  Overall findings indicate the need for more comprehensive control of such well
  -known occupational allergens as the isocyanates. In addition, SENSOR
  interventions have prompted improvements in protection for workers. ACTIONS
  TAKEN: Approaches to state-based surveillance and intervention for OA are being
  developed through newly funded 5-year SENSOR projects in four states
  (California, Massachusetts, Michigan, and New Jersey). The goal is to develop a
  model for effective state-based OA surveillance that can be applied by any
  state health department.

AB: Problem/Condition: Improved surveillance for silicosis is needed to target
  interventions to prevent this occupational lung disease caused by the
  inhalation of crystalline silica dust. Reporting Period Covered: 1987-1990.
  Description of Systems: State-based silicosis surveillance and intervention
  programs have been developed in Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio, and Wisconsin as
  part of the Sentinel Event Notification System for Occupational Risks (SENSOR)
  Program, initiated in 1987 by the National Institute for Occupational Safety
  and Health (NIOSH). Results: From 1987 through 1990, the SENSOR program
  confirmed a total of 430 cases of silicosis reported from these four states.
  Overall, approximately 60% of these cases were in workers employed in primary
  metal industries, although the types of industries in which cases occurred
  varied by state. Some cases were attributable to relatively recent exposure,
  including new cases in seven persons first exposed since 1980 in New Jersey.
  Silicosis case reports have prompted measurement of respirable silica
  concentrations at 25 Michigan work sites, and 14 (56%) of these sites were
  found to have levels that exceeded the legally permissible exposure level.
  Interpretation: The silicosis surveillance and intervention strategies piloted
  by state health departments in the NIOSH-funded SENSOR Program have
  demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of identifying specific silica
  -using work sites that need preventive intervention. Actions Taken: On the
  basis of initial experience in these four states, NIOSH developed guidelines
  for state-based silicosis surveillance and awarded SENSOR cooperative
  agreements to three additional states where the applicability of these
  surveillance methods will be further evaluated.

AB: The surveillance of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) through case
  reporting only reflects the epidemiologic features of HIV (human
  immunodeficiency virus) transmission a few years earlier and not the prevalence
  of HIV seropositivity. HIV infection is not a notifiable condition in Quebec.
  We were asked by the ministere de la Sante et des Services sociaux du Quebec to
  perform a pilot project for the surveillance of HIV seropositivity using a
  network of sentinel physicians. From May 15, 1988, to Sept. 30, 1989,
  physicians from four collaborating centres collected data on the serologic
  status, demographic characteristics and risk factors for 4209 patients who
  underwent HIV antibody testing. Of the 3899 subjects included in the study 7.9%
  were HIV positive. Through logistic regression analysis the following variables
  were found to be significantly associated with HIV seropositivity: presence of
  HIV-related symptoms (prevalence odds ratio [POR] 36.5), origin from an endemic
  area (POR 9.1), homosexuality or bisexuality (POR 8.4), intravenous drug use
  (POR 4.2), male sex (POR 2.8), previous HIV antibody testing (POR 2.5) and
  previous sexually transmitted disease (POR 1.8). Over the study period we found
  a large increase in HIV seroprevalence among intravenous drug users (4.2% in
  1988 to 19.0% in 1989) (p = 0.02). This increase might reflect a recent change
  in the epidemiologic pattern of HIV transmission in Quebec. Surveillance of HIV
  seropositivity through a network of sentinel physicians may be a reasonable
  alternative to mandatory reporting.

AB: The results of recently completed trials in Africa of insecticide-treated
  bed nets (ITBN) offer new possibilities for malaria control. These experimental
  trials aimed for high ITBN coverage combined with high re-treatment rates.
  Whilst necessary to understand protective efficacy, the approaches used to
  deliver the intervention provide few indications of what coverage of net re
  -treatment would be under operational conditions. Varied delivery and financing
  strategies have been proposed for the sustainable delivery of ITBNs and re
  -treatment programmes. Following the completion of a randomized, controlled
  trial on the Kenyan coast, a series of suitable delivery strategies were used
  to continue net re-treatment in the area. The trial adopted a bi-annual, house
  -to-house re-treatment schedule free of charge using research project staff and
  resulted in over 95% coverage of nets issued to children. During the year
  following the trial, sentinel dipping stations were situated throughout the
  community and household members informed of their position and opening times.
  This free re-treatment service achieved between 61-67% coverage of nets used by
  children for three years. In 1997 a social marketing approach, that introduced
  cost-retrieval, was used to deliver the net re-treatment services. The
  immediate result of this transition was that significantly fewer of the mothers
  who had used the previous re-treatment services adopted this revised approach
  and coverage declined to 7%. The future of new delivery services and their
  financing are discussed in the context of their likely impact upon previously
  defined protective efficacy and cost-effectiveness estimates. Recent trials of
  insecticide-treated bednets (ITBN) in Africa sought to achieve high ITBN
  coverage together with high net retreatment rates.  Following the completion of
  a randomized, controlled trial on the coast of Kenya, a series of delivery
  strategies were used to continue net retreatment in the area.  Adherence to a
  free bi-annual, house-to-house retreatment schedule resulted in a more than 95%
  coverage of nets issued to children.  During the year following the trial,
  sentinel dipping stations were situated throughout the community and household
  members informed of their locations and opening times.  More than 85% of
  bednets were re-impregnated between October 1993 and October 1995, and 61-67%
  coverage of nets used by children for 3 years after the free retreatment
  service was launched beginning in 1996.  The introduction of a social marketing
  approach at sentinel sites in 1997 to retrieve some of the costs of the net
  retreatment services caused coverage to drop to 7.1% among children still
  resident in the study area who had had nets since 1993.  The future of new
  delivery services and their financing are discussed with regard to their likely
  impact upon previously defined protective efficacy and cost-effectiveness
  estimates.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiology of HIV in Ho Chi Minh City in the
  context of current surveillance data from Vietnam. METHODS: Since the late
  1980s, HIV surveillance data have been collected in Ho Chi Minh City from
  centers for the treatment of venereal disease and tuberculosis, centers for the
  rehabilitation of injecting drug users and sex workers, prenatal clinics, blood
  banks and other sites. RESULTS: The first case of HIV infection in Vietnam was
  identified in 1990 in Ho Chi Minh City. The cumulative number of reported HIV
  infections in this city at the end of 1996 was 2774, about half of the number
  of cases in the country; 86% of infections were among men, 86% among injecting
  drug users, 2.5% among patients with sexually transmitted diseases and 2.5%
  among sex workers. The first HIV infection among antenatal women was detected
  in 1994. The prevalence of HIV among injecting drug users rose dramatically
  from 1% in 1992 to 39% in 1996, compared with 1.2% among sex workers, 0.3%
  among blood donors and 1.3% among tuberculosis patients in 1996. The
  populations of injecting drug users and sex workers in Ho Chi Minh City are
  estimated to be 30000 and 80000, respectively, and rates of sexually
  transmitted diseases are 2-3 per 1000 persons per year. By the end of December
  1996, 42 out of 53 provinces had reported HIV infections, and border areas near
  China and Cambodia began identifying large numbers of HIV-seropositive people.
  CONCLUSIONS: Ho Chi Minh City is at the forefront of a new HIV epidemic in
  Vietnam. This epidemic shows similarities to that in Thailand nearly a decade
  ago, with rapidly rising HIV rates among injecting drug users and infection
  already established among sex workers. Prevention efforts should include the
  targeting of injecting drug users and sex workers outside rehabilitation
  centers, the availability of sterile needles and condoms, the establishment of
  anonymous testing sites, the control of sexually transmitted diseases and the
  coordination of programs within southeast Asia. An analysis of annual sentinel
  surveillance data from Viet Nam indicates that Ho Chi Minh City is at the
  forefront of a new HIV epidemic.  Since 1990, data on HIV cases have been
  collected from prenatal clinics, blood banks, centers for the treatment of
  sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and tuberculosis, and rehabilitation
  centers for injecting drug users and commercial sex workers.  The first HIV
  case in Viet Nam was reported in 1990 in Ho Chi Minh City.  By the end of 1996,
  a cumulative total of 4961 HIV cases had been documented in Viet Nam, 2774 of
  which were in Ho Chi Minh City.  In Ho Chi Minh City, 86.5% of cumulative HIV
  infections involved men.  The distribution of total HIV cases by group has
  been: injecting drug users, 86.0%; tuberculosis patients, 3.3%; sex workers,
  2.5%; STD patients, 2.5%; and pregnant women, 0.6%.  By 1996, 42 of Viet Nam's
  53 provinces had reported HIV cases and infection rates are rising dramatically
  in border areas near China and Cambodia.  The pattern documented in this
  analysis resembles that observed in Thailand a decade ago: rapidly rising HIV
  rates among injecting drug users and infection already established among sex
  workers, without dissemination to the general population.  The necessary
  infrastructure and resources for control of the epidemic are far more limited
  in Viet Nam than Thailand, however.  Recommended, to prevent the further spread
  of HIV in Viet Nam, are educational activities targeted at injecting drug users
  and sex workers outside of rehabilitation centers, the availability of condoms
  and sterile needles, establishment of anonymous testing sites, control of STDs,
  and the coordination of programs within southeast Asia.

AB: HIV infection is firmly established in the general population of Thailand
  and will soon exact substantial medical, social, and economic effects at the
  community and household levels.  The primary risk behavior for infection in
  Thailand is heterosexual intercourse compounded by high levels of other
  sexually transmitted diseases (STD) and the general cultural acceptance of
  commercial sex.  The June 1993 round of sentinel surveillance for HIV
  seroprevalence found median and provincial ranges as follows: 35.2% in the
  range of 13.3-70.8% among IV drug users, 28.7% in the range of 5.1-64.1% among
  direct sex workers, 7.6% in the range of 0.0-37.3% among indirect sex workers,
  8.0% in the range of 0.0-33.0% among men attending STD clinics, 1.4% in the
  range of 0.0-7.6% among women attending antenatal clinics, and 0.74% in the
  range of 0.0-8.4% among blood donors.  HIV seroprevalence was 4.0% among
  military conscripts in May 1993.  Men and women in Thailand with no other risk
  factor than sex with a spouse are often at risk of infection with HIV. 
  Urban/rural differentials are minimal, with HIV infection strewn across the
  country.  HIV seroprevalence levels continue to climb despite some success with
  interventions in slowing the rate of infection among military conscripts and
  reducing the incidence and prevalence of STDs.  Interventions, health care, and
  coping responses therefore need to be delivered at the community level
  throughout the country.  Although much emphasis has been given to the
  prevalence of HIV infection in Northern Thailand, seroprevalence data show that
  other parts of the country will soon experience the same explosion of AIDS
  cases observed in the North over the past two years.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To determine whether saliva could serve as an alternative to
  serum for HIV-antibody testing in an ongoing sentinel surveillance program in
  Thailand. METHODS: Serum and saliva specimens were collected from 1955
  individuals in four of the 73 sentinel sites of the national surveillance
  program in Thailand. Intravenous drug users, female prostitutes, and men
  attending sexually transmitted disease clinics were included as participants.
  All specimens were collected and tested anonymously. Saliva was gathered with
  the Omni-Sal collection device and analyzed for the presence of HIV antibodies
  using the immunoglobulin G antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
  (GACELISA) laboratory test, specially designed for low concentration body
  fluids. Our gold standard was serum, collected and analyzed independently from
  the saliva specimens, using an ELISA test for screening and Western blot for
  confirmation. Linkage between serum and saliva was blind to the laboratory. A
  set of HIV-positive and HIV-negative quality assurance samples for both serum
  and saliva were also analyzed blind. RESULTS: Findings are presented as
  observed in the field, and as quality assurance samples after the correction of
  various field and laboratory errors. The sensitivity of the GACELISA with
  saliva was 98.0% in the field (298 HIV-positive specimens), 100% after
  correction of errors (300 HIV-positive specimens), and 100% among the quality
  assurance samples (95 HIV-positive specimens). The specificity of the GACELISA
  was 99.4% in the field (1653 HIV-negative specimens), 99.6% after correction of
  errors (1654 HIV-negative specimens), and 100% among the quality assurance
  samples (96 HIV-negative specimens). CONCLUSION: Our findings support other
  published studies that also featured the GACELISA. We conclude that saliva is
  comparable to serum for assessing HIV antibodies in individuals for
  surveillance and screening purposes.

AB: The annual and monthly distributions of congenital abnormalities and
  pregnancy outcomes as confounding factors were evaluated in Hungary in
  reflection of the accident at the Chernobyl reactor. The different congenital
  abnormality entities and the components of fetal radiation syndrome did not
  show a higher rate after the Chernobyl accident in the data-set of the
  Hungarian Congenital Abnormality Registry. Among confounding factors, the rate
  of induced abortions did not increase after the Chernobyl accident in Hungary.
  In the 9th month after the peak of public concern (May and June, 1986) the rate
  of livebirths decreased. Three indicator conditions: 15 sentinel anomalies as
  indicators of germinal dominant gene mutations, Down syndrome as an indicator
  of germinal numerical and structural chromosomal mutations, and unidentified
  multiple congenital abnormalities as indicators of germinal dominant gene and
  chromosomal mutations were selected from the material of the Hungarian
  Congenital Abnormality Registry. Diagnoses were checked, familial and sporadic
  cases were separated and only the sporadic cases were evaluated. The analysis
  of indicator conditions did not reveal any measurable germinal mutagenic effect
  of the Chernobyl accident in Hungary. The Hungarian Investigation of the
  effects of radiation from the Chernobyl accident involved evaluation of
  isolated and multiple congenital anomalies (CAs), unidentified CAs, fetal
  radiation syndrome, induced abortions, sentinel anomalies, and Down syndrome
  prevalence.  There were no measurable teratogenic and germinal mutagenic
  effects after the April 28-May 15, 1986 impact.  The highest beta activity
  occurred through late June.  The highest external gamma ray level was .4 uSv. 
  Hungary had the 13th highest radiocesium (Cs 137) deposition (7.9 x 10 to the
  14th power Bg) and the 10th-11th highest national collective 50-year total body
  dose (1.3 x 10 to the 4th power person Gy).  The level of external dose and
  individual total body ingestion dose gave Hungary a rank of 70th.  The maximum
  extra dose was around .4 mSv in some regions.  Mortality is obligatorily
  recorded and all births take place in hospitals with obstetrically trained
  birth attendants where CAs are also recorded.  Registration of CAs is
  considered nearly complete and is available from the Hungarian Congenital
  Abnormality Registry (HCAR).  Data on induced abortion, fetal deaths, and live
  births is provided by the Central Statistical Office to HCAR.  The Hungarian
  Surveillance of Germinal Mutations (HSGM) provides data on sentinel anomalies,
  Down syndrome, and unidentified multiple CAs.  The results indicate that
  isolated and multiple CA entities in 1986 and 1987, annually or monthly, did
  not exceed the rates of previous years.  Microencephaly, cataracts,
  microphthalmos, and CAs of the eyes, and other fetal radiation syndrome showed
  no monthly increase and did not exceed the expected numbers based on baseline
  figures of 1973-82, regardless of region.  The monthly distribution of induced
  abortions did not change after Chernobyl.  February and March 1987 births
  decreased in the 9=month period after Chernobyl.  An average of 3.7 new
  mutations/10,000 live births was found annually between 1980-89 which was not a
  significant change.  Down syndrome cases averaged 104.year due to numerical or
  structural chromosomal changes and was not considered significant. 
  Unidentified MCAs did not show an increased rate.

AB: BACKGROUND: Routine axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for elderly women
  with invasive breast cancer has been questioned because it rarely alters
  therapy yet carries a significant morbidity rate. Sentinel lymphadenectomy
  (SLND) improves axillary staging and alters therapy in women with T1 breast
  cancer, but it is not clear whether SLND alters therapy in elderly women with
  breast cancer. METHODS: A prospective breast cancer data base was used to
  identify women 70 years old and older who underwent SLND for axillary staging
  of invasive breast cancer between 1991 and 1998. RESULTS: There were 75
  invasive breast cancers in 73 women. The mean patient age was 74.5 years
  (range, 70-90 years). Median tumor size was 1.4 cm (range, 0.1-6.2 cm). Of the
  75 tumors, 42 (56%) had favorable primary characteristics; the remaining tumors
  had unfavorable characteristics. SLND was performed alone in 17 cases (23%) and
  was followed by completion ALND in 58 cases (77%). Positive lymph nodes were
  identified in 32 cases (43%); 26 (81.3%) were detected by hematoxylin and eosin
  stains, and 6 (18.7%) were detected by immunohistochemistry alone. Five
  patients (6.9%) received adjuvant chemotherapy. Seven patients (9.6%) received
  axillary/supraclavicular radiation for positive nodes. Ten (13.7%) of 73
  patients had obvious alterations in therapy because of axillary nodal status.
  As a result of SLND, 3 (13.6%) of 22 patients with tumors 1.0 cm or smaller
  received tamoxifen, and 7 (15%) of 46 patients with tumors between 1.0 and 3.0
  cm in size had changes in therapy. When patient and tumor characteristics were
  analyzed to determine relationships to therapeutic decision-making, nodal
  status was the variable most significantly associated with changes in therapy
  (P = .0001). CONCLUSIONS: SLND improves axillary staging in elderly women with
  invasive breast cancer. Results of immunohistochemistry do not alter therapy in
  this group of individuals (P = .6367). In patients with small primary tumors,
  SLND alters therapy by increasing the number of patients receiving tamoxifen.
  In addition, SLND affects adjuvant systemic chemotherapy and regional
  radiotherapy in a significant number of patients with larger tumors,
  particularly tumors between 1.0 and 3.0 cm.

AB: BACKGROUND: Several reports have demonstrated accurate prediction of nodal
  metastasis with radiolocalization and selective resection of the radiolocalized
  sentinel lymph node (SLN) in patients with breast cancer and melanoma. As
  reliance on this technique grows, its use by those without experience in
  radiation safety will increase. METHODS: Tissue obtained during radioguided SLN
  biopsies was examined for residual radioactivity. Specimens with a specific
  activity greater than the radiologic control level (RCL) of 0.002 microCi/g
  were considered radioactive. Radiation exposure to the surgical team was
  measured. RESULTS: A total of 24 primary tissue specimens and 318 lymph nodes
  were obtained during 57 operations (37 for breast cancer, 20 for melanoma). All
  24 (100%) of the specimens injected with radiopharmaceutical and 89 of 98 (91%)
  of the localized nodes were radioactive after surgery. Activity fell below the
  RCL 71+/-3.6 hours in primary tissue specimens, 46+/-1.7 hours in nodes from
  melanoma patients, and 33+/-3.5 hours in nodes from breast cancer patients (P =
  .037). The hands of the surgical team (n = 22 cases) were exposed to 9.4+/-3.6
  mrem/case. CONCLUSION: Although low levels of radiation exposure are associated
  with radiolocalization and resection of the SLN, the presented guidelines
  ensure conformity to existing regulations and allow timely pathologic analysis.

AB: 1. In order to realize the full potential of natural enemies in integrated
  pest management, it is necessary to understand their population dynamics,
  particularly in relation to the role of refuges. Harvested and unharvested
  plots were established in a commercial hay lucerne Medicago sativa crop and the
  potential for the unharvested vegetation to constitute a refuge for natural
  enemies of Helicoverpa spp., one of the key pests, was evaluated. 2. The
  temporal and spatial dynamics of arthropod populations were evaluated using
  sequential samples from directional traps (pitfall and Malaise) and vacuum
  sampling in both crop treatments. 3. The spatial dynamics of predation were
  measured using `sentinel' cards baited with Helicoverpa spp. eggs. 4. There was
  no significant directional movement of arthropods captured in pitfall traps,
  except for a 3-day period immediately after harvest when there was a net
  movement of the natural enemies Dicranolaius bellulus, Carabidae adults,
  spiders and the phytophagous mite Halotydeus destructor from harvested to
  unharvested plots. 5. There was net movement of adult Netelia producta, D.
  bellulus, Coccinella transversalis and Syrphidae as well as the pest
  Helicoverpa spp. from harvested to unharvested plots for 24 h following a
  harvest. 6. Densities of D. bellulus and C. transversalis within unharvested
  plots decreased with increasing distance from the borders with harvested plots.
  7. Predation rates of Helicoverpa eggs placed in unharvested plots were broadly
  consistent with predator densities and decreased with distance from the
  harvested plots. 8. Predation rates of Helicoverpa eggs placed in harvested
  plots declined with increasing distance from unharvested plots, suggesting that
  natural enemies from the latter dispersed into regrowing lucerne. 9. Strips
  narrower than the plot width used (30 m) may be adequate to accommodate natural
  enemies displaced by harvesting. Unharvested refuge strips should ideally be
  spaced less than 30 m apart so that the natural enemies can contribute to
  biological control of pests over the entire width of harvested strips.

AB: This study compared the use of sentinel species- and community-based field
  approaches for assessing the biological status of fish living in a river
  receiving pulp and paper mill effluents. Three approaches were compared. Two
  approaches used sentinel species. One of these involved an internal/external
  examination of the fish that leads to the calculation of a fish health
  assessment index (HAI) and the other involved biochemical measurements of
  hepatic mixed function oxidase (MFO) activity and plasma steroid levels. The
  third approach characterized the fish community structure according to an index
  of biotic integrity (IBI). The comparison focused on how the methods respond to
  the hypothesis that recent process modifications/effluent treatment changes,
  resulting in demonstrable improvements in effluent quality, have beneficial
  effects on fish. Neither of the approaches using sentinel fish indicated clear
  mill-related influences either before or after the process
  modifications/effluent treatment changes. There was no evidence of depressed
  plasma steroids and increased MFO activity in fish frequently associated with
  mill effluent exposure in previous studies. While the HAI was higher at
  stations downstream from two mills, this could not be linked to effluent
  exposure alone. In contrast, the study of community structure showed a
  substantial improvement in fish assemblages at all the mill sites.

AB: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are xenobiotics whose elevated toxicity for
  living organisms requires to efficiently monitor air pollution, either by
  evaluating their levels in the environment, or by assessing their biological
  impacts on sentinel organisms. We investigated the effects of naphthalene
  exposure on some xenobiotic-metabolising enzyme activities in three organs of
  Helix aspersa. Particular activities depending on cytochrome P450
  (ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase, EROD; ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase, ECOD;
  pentoxyresorufin O-dealkylase, PROD) and associated with glutathione
  (glutathione S-transferase, GST; glutathione peroxidase, GPX; glutathione
  reductase, GR) were assessed. In control animals, the P450-dependent specific
  activities were distributed according to the range kidney > digestive gland >
  mantle cavity forming tissues (MCFT). Neither ECOD nor PROD activities could be
  detected in MCFT. In the two other organs, the major phase I activities were
  due to ECOD, the level of PROD being very low or null. The glutathione
  -associated activities showed comparable levels in the three organs, except GPX
  activity that was higher in the digestive gland. Naphthalene (NAP) exposure did
  not affect any activity in MCFT, but it significantly decreased EROD and ECOD
  activities in the kidney as opposed to their increase in the digestive gland,
  whereas PROD activities were not influenced by the treatment. Glutathione
  -dependent activities were not significantly affected by NAP exposure, except
  for GPX which activity diminished in the digestive gland. This study
  demonstrates that complex detoxification pathways should exist in Helix aspersa
  as in mammals and that they could be used as potential biomarkers of NAP
  exposure.

AB: The presence of toxic substances in the Great Lakes (GL) continues to be a
  significant concern. Eleven of the most persistent and ubiquitous substances
  were identified as "critical Great Lakes pollutants" by the International Joint
  Commission (IJC). In some areas of the GL these toxic substances bioaccumulate
  in sediment and organisms, biomagnify in food webs, and persist at high levels.
  The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) Great Lakes Human
  Health Effects Research Program (GLHHERP) characterizes contaminant exposures
  via GL fish consumption and investigates the potential for short- and long-term
  adverse health effects. The program has identified a set of eight indicators to
  determine risk. The GLHHERP findings indicate: (1) vulnerable populations are
  still being exposed to persistent toxic substances (2) body burden levels are
  two to four times higher than in the general U.S. population, (3) women and
  minorities are less knowledgeable about fish advisories than other segments of
  the population, (4) the presence of neurodevelopmental deficits in newborns,
  and cognitive deficits in children and adults, and (5) disturbances in
  reproductive parameters have been demonstrated in adults. The public health
  implications of these findings and the need for intervention strategies are
  discussed.

AB: This paper presents the concentration of super(210)Po in five species of
  bivalve molluscs (Donax faba, Donax cuneatus, Scapharca inaequivalvis, Pinctada
  vulgaris and Perna indica) from Gulf of Mannar, southeast coast of India. The
  levels of super(210)Po among the tested species ranged from 65.8 to 2,668.9 Bq
  kg-1. Analyses indicated that the soft tissues of the bivalves registered a
  higher level of super(210)Po than the shells.Further, analyses also showed a
  non-uniformity in the distribution of super(210)Po in the various internal
  organs. The concentration recorded in them maintained the following descending
  order: digestive glands > viscera > gills > foot > mantle > shell. It is
  evident that P. indica could be used as a sentinel organism for super(210)Po in
  the ambient waters.

AB: In the former West Germany, in specific venereal diseases legislation passed
  in 1953, only syphilis, gonorrhoea, ulcus molle, and lymphogranuloma venereum
  were defined as venereal diseases and subject to mandatory notification. The
  proportion of unreported cases was as high as 75% for syphilis and up to 90%
  for gonorrhoea. Epidemiological data for the past 10 years exist only on
  selected populations from research studies and are summarized in this article.
  In the former East Germany reporting of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
  was mandatory and, due to the centralized organization, underreporting was
  considered to be low, although no specific studies have examined this. After
  the unification in 1990 of the two German states the West German laws were
  adopted in East Germany. Since 1982 - when the first AIDS case was reported in
  Germany - information on AIDS cases has voluntarily been collected at the
  national register at the AIDS Centre of the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin.
  The law governing the reporting of infectious diseases has recently been
  revised. Under the new Protection against Infection Act, which became effective
  on 1 January 2001, clinical diagnoses of STIs (with the exception of hepatitis
  B) are no longer notifiable diseases. Laboratory reporting of positive test
  results for Treponema pallidum has been introduced. With T. pallidum and HIV
  notifications, additional disaggregated data are collected. Since T. pallidum
  and HIV remain the only notifiable STIs, all other STIs have to be monitored
  through sentinel surveillance systems. These surveillance systems are currently
  being established. Under the new legislation, local health authorities have to
  provide adequate counselling and testing services for STIs, which may be
  provided free of charge if necessary.

AB: Gulfwatch is an international monitoring program that uses Mytilus edulis as
  the sentinel species for habitat exposure to toxic contaminants in the Gulf of
  Maine. Since 1991, the Gulfwatch program has measured the concentrations of 10
  trace metals, 17 chlorinated pesticides, 24 polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons
  (PAHs), and 24 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners in mussel tissue from
  over 60 sites throughout the Gulf of Maine. In 1998, the Gulfwatch program
  included a more intensive survey of sites in New Hampshire. Of the 21 sites
  sampled in the Gulf in 1998, six sites were sampled in New Hampshire and the
  other 15 sites were in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Maine, and Massachusetts.
  Results for the Gulfwide program showed a southward trend of increasing
  concentrations for organic contaminants and Ag, Cr, and Pb, reflecting major
  local and regional pollution sources. The distribution of the remaining trace
  metals was more uniform, without obvious impacts from the more heavily
  urbanized areas of the southern gulf. At some sites there appears to be
  localized hot spots for a variety of contaminants. Gulfwide geometric mean (GM)
  concentrations were lower than GM +85% confidence level (CL) concentration for
  the NOAA National Status and Trends (NS&T) Mussel Watch program, except for Hg.
  Two sites had Pb concentrations that exceeded U.S. FDA guideline levels. While
  Hg concentrations did not exceed the U.S. FDA action concentration at any site,
  the NS&T GM +85% CL was exceeded at all 1998 Gulfwatch sites. The spatially
  intensive New Hampshire program has been useful in identifying local sources of
  contaminants and determining the significance of mussel exposure to oil from
  chronic discharges and larger spills. Similar to comparisons between Gulfwatch
  and NS&T data, interpretation of New Hampshire results benefit from comparisons
  to the greater Gulfwatch program.

AB: As part of the amended Metal Mining Liquid Effluent Regulations under the
  Fisheries Act, mines will be required to develop and conduct Environmental
  Effects Monitoring (EEM). EEM will be done to evaluate the effects of mine
  effluent on fish, fish habitat, and fish usability. Mines will be required to
  determine if there are changes in fish populations and/or in the usability of
  fish due to mine effluent. The EEM program has been designed with a tiered
  monitoring approach, with the first phase determining if an effect is present.
  Subsequent phases of EEM will focus on continued monitoring and determining the
  magnitude, geographic extent, and cause of effects (if any). Fish collected
  from the area exposed to mine effluent will be compared to fish from a
  reference area in order to determine if there is an effect, if the effect is
  mine related and the cause of the effect within the effluent. The fish
  population survey will examine the growth, reproduction, condition, and
  survival of one or more resident sentinel fish species. Fish usability will be
  determined based on the appearance of fish, their use, and the contaminant
  levels in fish tissue. It is recognized that some mines may not be able to
  implement a fish monitoring program as outlined, so it has been recommended
  that alternative methods, such as caged bivalves or on-site bioassays, may also
  be used. Frequency of monitoring will be dependent on the previous results of
  the fish and benthic invertebrate monitoring phases.

AB: Under the Canadian Fisheries Act, pulp and paper mills and metal mines must
  conduct a cyclical monitoring program for potential environmental effects that
  includes a fish survey. Study designs for the fish survey have been evolving
  over the past few years, and there has been increased emphasis on the use of
  small-bodied fish species. Increasing concerns about the potential impacts of
  sampling programs on the fish populations in smaller receiving waters have led
  us to develop non-lethal sampling methodologies that will satisfy the
  information requirements for the environmental effects monitoring program. This
  manuscript outlines the use of a non-lethal sampling program to collect
  information on age distributions, growth rates, reproductive performance and
  fish condition in populations of slimy sculpin inhabiting forested and
  agricultural sections of a small New Brunswick river.

AB: The overall objective of this study is to promote the development of
  environmental health indicators in Mexico City. Specific examples focused on
  water quality, household characteristics e.g., sanitation and risk of enteric
  diseases. A geographic information system (GIS) was used in order to identify
  eligible wells and their surrounding homesteads (0.5 km around each well). A
  pilot study was conducted during the rainy season (1999), and a total of 1,250
  eligible households were visited on a random sample basis; only those having
  children under 5 years of age were interviewed. Data on diarrheal disease (i.e.
  occurrence in the previous two weeks) were obtained from 950 children, and
  their guardians provided information on their water supply, sanitation and
  socioeconomic variables. A total of 320 water samples were obtained from 40
  wells, and tested for Total coliforms (TC/100 ml), Fecal coliforms (FC/100 ml).
  Escherichia coli (EC) and Fecal streptococci (FS). Bacterial indicators were
  detected in 40% of the wells in the western zone and in 32% of the southern
  zone (p = 0.01). The rate of diarrheal diseases was higher for children from
  the southern areas than in the west (OR = 1.7 and 95% CI: 0.99, 2.86). The
  final analysis showed a higher risk of diarrhea in children from rented homes
  than those living in owned dwellings (OR = 1.7 and 95% Cl: 1.04, 2.77): the
  risk was also highest for children living in houses with poor sanitation
  facilities (e.g., latrine) than those connected to a sewerage (OR = 1.7 and 95%
  Cl: 1.00, 2.93). Children from households perceiving unpleasant taste of water
  showed a higher risk than those without complaints (OR = 2.2 and 95% Cl: 1.28,
  3.75). Linkages between environmental factors and health risk were created from
  spatially distributed information, and the proposed environmental health
  indicator (EHI) summarized the most significant predictors of diarrheal
  diseases. This baseline information may contribute to further environmental
  health investigation and policy making analysis.

AB: The cellular processes involved in metal metabolism in molluscs are
  reviewed, with emphasis on the contribution of microscopy (AMG, ARG, EPMA, and
  SIMS) to both basic research of metal cell biology and applied environmental
  research. In molluscs, metal uptake may occur by facilitated diffusion, active
  transport, or endocytosis, and can be enhanced by MT synthesis or formation of
  mineralized granules. In aquatic molluscs, gills constitute a key interface for
  dissolved metal uptake, where metals are bound to MT, incorporated into
  lysosomes, and released basally towards the blood plasma and circulating
  hemocytes. However, particulate metal uptake is mainly achieved via the
  digestive tract by endocytosis; further metals are transferred first to
  lysosomes and then to residual bodies, especially in the digestive cells of the
  digestive gland. Additionally, metals can be accumulated selectively in
  specific cell types. As ligands pools differ from cell to cell, different
  metals may be retained in different cell types. Class "a" metals are localized
  in cells with granules composed of carbonate, oxalate, phosphate, and sulfate
  (oxygen donors), whereas "b" metals are associated with those cell types rich
  in sulfur and nitrogen ligands (sulfur donors). In molluscs, oxygen donors
  occur in connective tissue calcium cells and basophilic cells, whereas sulfur
  donors are present in digestive cells, podocytes, nephrocytes, and rhogocytes.
  Hemocytes, which constitute the most relevant system for metal transport
  between tissues, move around the body and may penetrate tissues and remove
  metals from the inner medium to be accumulated in lysosomes as nondigested
  products. Rhogocytes also participate in metal mobilization, accumulation, and
  release. The assessment of metal levels in target cells of sentinel molluscs by
  microscopic techniques provides an early-warning measure, with promising
  applications as an exposure biomarker for environmental monitoring programs.

AB: Although the effects of heavy metals on marine invertebrate species are well
  studied in term of their toxicity and bioaccumulation, less is known about
  their genotoxicity. The aim of this investigation was to assess the DNA
  damaging potential of cadmium (Cd) in an important pollution sentinel organism,
  the mussel Mytilus edulis. Cadmium is one of the most toxic and widespread
  heavy metals found in the marine environment, and is a recognised carcinogen in
  mammals. Based on the results of the comet assay (alkaline single cell gel
  electrophoresis), Cd was found not to be genotoxic in mussel gill cells under
  acute and chronic exposure conditions, whereas pre-exposure to low
  concentrations of Cd was found to enhance the genotoxicity of another mutagen,
  hydrogen peroxide (H sub(2)O sub(2)). The effects of H sub(2)O sub(2) were
  normally reversible when cells were transferred to clean saline buffer.
  However, in cells that had been pre-treated with Cd, in vivo or in vitro, we
  observed a decrease in this post-treatment DNA repair. The effects of Cd were
  reversed by zinc which suggests that the inhibitory effect of Cd on DNA repair
  was due to the displacement of zinc ions from active sites on proteins involved
  in the repair process (a property already described for mammals). Moreover,
  since Cd inhibits or delays the onset of apoptosis (programmed cell death),
  this removes one of the main defence mechanisms responsible for protecting the
  organism against neoplasia. There appears to be a close similarity between the
  effects of Cd on marine molluscs and mammals.

AB: In April 1998, an ecological disaster resulting from a massive toxic spill
  of mining acid waste rich in heavy metals posed a serious threat to the Donana
  National Park in southwestern Spain. This especially important protected area
  is the nesting and breeding site for many endangered bird species; white storks
  (Ciconia ciconia) and black kites (Milvus migrans) are considered the more
  representative. The suitability of the Comet assay as a biomarker for genotoxic
  analysis in environmental biomonitoring has been recently validated in studies
  using different sentinel organisms such as fish, amphibians, rodents, or
  mollusks. Birds preying on a variety of invertebrate and vertebrate species in
  the marshlands are appropriate for evaluating the potential deleterious effects
  of the toxic spill on wildlife of the Donana area. Our study on wetland birds
  high on the aquatic trophic chain sampled within a few months after the toxic
  spill in the area around Donana National Park has shown the accumulation of
  heavy metals. Fourteen months after the mine waste spill, blood samples from
  white storks and kites collected in the neighborhood of the park and from
  control birds at reference areas for comparison were examined by fluorescence
  image analysis after lymphocyte isolation, and by subsequent alkaline single
  -cell gel (SCG) electrophoresis, known as the Comet assay. Our results indicate
  that the exposed birds had a significantly increased level of genotoxic damage
  compared with control animals from noncontaminated locations.

AB: The toxiity of the Reconquista River water at Cascallares, a relatively low
  polluted point, was determined by means of bioassays with juvenile Cyprinus
  carpio as a test organism. During the summer of 1995-1996, three 30 days-long
  in situ caged fish tests were conducted. Changes in the activities of branchial
  (Na super(+), K super(+))- and Mg super(++)-ATPases and brain AchE of fish were
  studied. The chemical profile of the river water showed that heavy metals and
  phenols were the main pollutants. Gill ATPases activities were altered, while
  brain AchE activity resulted inhibited in one of the assays. (Na super(+), K
  super(+))-dependent activity was inhibited approximately 20% as compared with
  controls; in two assays Mg super(++)-ATPase activity was stimulated. The
  condition factor of caged fish did not differ from controls. Since the protein
  content of gills was slightly altered, the detected changes in the enzyme
  activity should not be linked to alterations in the protein synthesis.

AB: The biomarker approach, adopted from medical toxicology, is subject to
  several theoretical and practical difficulties when used to address
  environmental problems. The problems are related to the definition that
  emphasizes measurement but does not specify a requirement to establish cause
  -effect linkages. An improved definition for a bioindicator is reviewed. The
  sentinel species approach is judged to be a biomarker rather than a
  bioindicator, and therefore of limited use for environmental risk assessment.
  An empirical weight of evidence approach to improve the utility of sentinel
  species is proposed.

AB: Bucephaloides gracilescens is a common parasite in the intestine of the

  a number of gadoid intermediate hosts. In a toxicokinetic study of lindane (
  gamma -hexachlorocyclohexane) in bullrout Myoxocephalus scorpius, metacercariae
  of B. gracilescens were found in the central nervous system (CNS). Furthermore,
  the metacercariae accumulated concentrations of lindane that were higher than
  in the surrounding CNS tissue. This is the first report of metacercariae of B.
  gracilescens in bullrout. In addition the present results contribute knowledge
  of the disposition of an important environmental contaminant in the
  metacercarial stage of a trematode that has been pointed out as a promising

AB: The effects of Cu and Cd on functional responses of hemocytes in Tapes
  philippinarum, a Veneridae clam widespread in the lagoon of Venice, were
  evaluated. Bivalves were exposed for 7 days to various concentrations of CuCl2
  . 2H2O (0, 10, 60, and 110 mu g/L) and CdCl2 . H2O (0, 150, 300, and 450 mu
  g/L). Hemocytes were collected from exposed clams, and the effects of Cu and Cd
  on phagocytosis, Neutral Red retention capacity, superoxide dismutase, and
  cytochrome oxidase activities were investigated. Hemocytes from animals exposed
  to Cu showed a significant decrease in phagocytic activity, whereas no
  inhibition was observed in cells from Cd-exposed animals. Diffusion of Neutral
  Red into the cytosol, an index of lysosomal membrane alteration, was enhanced
  by high concentrations of both metals. Different results in biochemical
  parameters were observed. Exposure to 60 and 110 mu g Cu/L caused a significant
  reduction in hemocyte superoxide dismutase activity, whereas no changes
  resulted after Cd exposure. Increased cytochrome oxidase activity was observed
  in hemocytes from mollusks exposed to 60 mu g Cu/L and 300 mu g Cd/L; no
  significant differences were found in cells from bivalves exposed to 110 mu g
  Cu/L and 450 mu g Cd/L. These results suggest a relationship between heavy
  metal exposure and alterations in functional responses of hemocytes in T.
  philippinarum and indicate that the type of observed effects vary with the
  nature and concentration of heavy metals. Moreover, the data obtained in the
  analyzed clam support the possibility of using it as sentinel organism in
  biomonitoring studies, even if used biomarkers will be further evaluated in
  field conditions.

AB: Reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic analyses of bile of a
  territorial benthic fish, oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau), indicated that fish
  from reference stations in the York and Elizabeth Rivers, Virginia, contained
  lower concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) metabolites than
  fish from polluted stations. PAH metabolite levels in the bile of fish from
  mildly polluted stations were 7 to 10 times greater than those from reference
  stations. PAH metabolite levels in fish from a moderately polluted station and
  a highly polluted station were, respectively, 20 and 50 times greater than
  those from reference stations. Differential patterns of five major PAH
  metabolites in fish from the same station suggested individual variability in
  metabolic pathways possibly further convoluted by the differential inductions
  or suppressions of hepatic mixed-function oxygenase isozyme systems under
  various natural or anthropogenic habitat parameters. PAH metabolite levels in
  the bile of oyster toadfish correlated well with the gradient of PAH
  contamination in the Elizabeth River sediments. High levels of biliary PAH
  metabolites were not detected in muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus) collected along
  the polluted sections of the Elizabeth River, probably due to their primarily
  herbivorous nature. Assuming that the hepatobiliary system and the
  gastrointestinal tract are the major routes of biotransformation and excretion
  of PAHs in the muskrats, the contaminated diet appears to be a more important
  routes of exposure of muskrats (and possibly oyster toadfish) to PAHs than the
  transdermal transfer. Occurrence permitting, we propose oyster toadfish as a
  useful biological sentinel for early detection of estuarine PAH pollution.

AB: In 1999, an aerial application of VectoLex registered WDG (water-dispersible
  granules) at 1.68 and 0.56 kg/ha, applied against sentinel 3rd-stage larvae of
  Psorophora columbiae installed in 0.42-ha rice plots 48 h after treatment,
  provided no control at 72 and 96 h after treatment. Less than 10% reduction was
  obtained at both rates 8 and 9 days after treatment against larvae of Ps.
  columbiae installed at 7 days after treatment. In a later test, VectoLex WDG
  manually applied at 5.04 and 1.68 kg/ha to small rice plots containing sentinel
  3rd-stage larvae of Ps. columbiae and Anopheles quadrimaculatus obtained 90 and
  97% control of Ps. columbiae at both rates, respectively, 24 h after treatment.
  A 2nd installation of Ps. columbiae at 24 h after treatment resulted in 7% and
  no control at both rates, respectively, even in the presence of larval
  carcasses from the 1 st installation. VectoLex WDG was not effective against
  Ps. columbiae after 24 h after treatment at either rate. Poor control was
  obtained at both rates against An. quadrimaculatus 24 h and 48 h after
  treatment for both installations. Two types of commercial rice fields
  containing native populations of larvae of An. quadrimaculatus were used for
  field tests in Cleveland, MS. In 1999, VectoLex WDG, aerially applied at 1.68
  and 0.56 kg/ha to 0.2-ha plots in a contoured rice field, produced 81 and 85%
  reductions in early (neonate and 1 st- and 2nd-stage) larvae and 94 and 76%
  reductions in late (3rd- and 4th-stage) larvae 2 days after treatment,
  respectively. At 2 days after treatment, means for all 4 developmental
  groupings (early larvae, late larvae, pupae, and combined stages) were
  significantly higher in untreated plots. Both VectoLex WDG rates did not differ
  significantly from one another. At 8 days after treatment, untreated plots
  contained significantly greater mean numbers of early larvae, late larvae, and
  combined stages, whereas both VectoLex WDG treatments were not significantly
  different. In 2000, VectoLex WDG applied at 1.68 kg/ha to two 0.40-ha plots in
  a precision-leveled field yielded 59 and 100% reductions of early and late
  larvae, respectively, 2 days after treatment. Reduction of late larvae remained
  100% at 8 days after treatment. The numbers of late larvae, pupae, and combined
  stages were significantly greater in the untreated plot 2 days after treatment.
  At 8 days after treatment, numbers of early larvae and combined stages were
  significantly higher in the VectoLex WDG plot, whereas numbers of late larvae
  were significantly higher in the untreated plot. The differences in
  susceptibility of Ps. columbiae and An. quadrimaculatus to VectoLex WDG could
  be attributed to species differences in larval feeding behavior, body
  positioning in the water column, and developmental time. In tests in Arkansas,
  Ps. columbiae were controlled more quickly, usually within 24 h of exposure,
  whereas the percent reduction for An. quadrimaculatus in both tests in
  Cleveland, MS, suggests that control of this species within the region tested
  required from 48 h up to 8 days of exposure.

AB: An extended-duration formulation of lambda-cyhalothrin (Demand super(TM) CS)
  applied as either an ultra\low volume (ULV) or thermal fog spray from a new
  handheld sprayer (Terrier super(TM)) against Aedes aegypti was evaluated in
  Honduras. Spray applications were made at the front door for 1 min or to each
  room for 15 sec, both for the ULV and thermal fog applications to houses in
  separate blocks for each treatment. The efficacy and duration of effectiveness
  of the spray was determined from sentinel caged mosquito mortality and
  collection of mosquitoes within houses with a backpack power aspirator.
  Sentinel caged mosquito mortality in both open and sequestered locations were
  97-100% for all spray treatments, with control mortality less than 2%. Both ULV
  applications (front door and each room) provided 4 wk of significant control (P
  < 0.01) based on adult Ae. aegypti house collections.

AB: There is no existing formal, long-term program for gathering evidence of the
  incidence and severity of the health effects of toxic substances in wildlife.
  However, research-based studies of bald eagles, herring gulls, night herons,
  tree swallows, snapping turtles, mink, and beluga over the past 30 years have
  revealed a broad spectrum of health effects in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence
  basin including thyroid and other endocrine disorders, metabolic diseases,
  altered immune function, reproductive impairment, developmental toxicity,
  genotoxicity, and cancer. These effects occurred most often and were most
  severe in the most contaminated sites (Green Bay, Saginaw Bay, Lake Ontario,
  the St. Lawrence estuary, and more recently, Lake Erie), some of which are
  International Joint Commission-designated Areas of Concern (AOCs). In all
  cases, a strong argument can be made for an environmental etiology, and in many
  cases for the involvement of persistent organic pollutants, particularly
  polychlorinated biphenyls, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, and polycyclic
  aromatic hydrocarbons. For some, the association with particular contaminants
  is consistent with controlled studies, and in some, dose-response relationships
  were documented. The biologic significance of these health impairments to the
  affected species is currently unclear, but they resemble those observed with
  increased incidence in human subpopulations in one or more AOCs. Formalizing
  health effects monitoring of sentinel wildlife species by the parties to the
  Canada-USA Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement is required. This would
  facilitate the optimal use of sentinel wildlife health data in a larger,
  epidemiologic weight-of-evidence context upon which to base decisions and
  policies regarding the effects of chemical exposures on human populations.

AB: Eel Anguilla anguilla plasma vitellogenin was investigated as a biomarker of
  exposure to environmental compounds with estrogenic activity, along the tidal
  course of the Thames Estuary, UK. A. anguilla was chosen as a sentinel species
  because of their wide distribution, robustness in field and laboratory studies
  and also because they have a characterised normal `intersex' condition where
  the gonad contains both developing male and female gonadal cells termed a
  Syrski organ. Following laboratory exposure to 17 beta -estradiol
  (intraperitoneal injection), a plasma protein (approx. 211 kDa apparent
  molecular weight) was detected by monoclonal antibodies to vitellogenin of
  striped bass (Morone saxatilis). Western and dot blot analyses were developed
  and vitellogenin was isolated from 17 beta -estradiol-treated fish to calibrate
  the quantification of the blots by image analysis. The limits of sensitivity
  for the Western and dot blots were 100 and 10 ng vitellogenin/ml, respectively.
  Levels of vitellogenin in Thames estuary samples were below the detection
  limits of the Western but not the dot blot, and showed no statistically
  significant site-specific (10 sites) and seasonal-specific (May, August,
  November) differences. Values were observed to be low, between 11 and 165
  ng/ml, compared with 17-50 mg/ml for 17 beta -estradiol-treated eels. Similar
  low levels of plasma vitellogenin were determined in fish sampled along the
  Tyne, Wear, Tees or Humber estuaries, or the Weston canal Liverpool, with mean
  plasma vitellogenin levels varying between 44 and 82 ng/ml. These levels of
  vitellogenin in A. anguilla plasma were observed to be consistent with the
  known biology of the eel. Immature females, or fish with syrski organs,
  reported both lower levels and smaller variation of plasma vitellogenin
  concentrations whereas the highest plasma vitellogenin concentrations were
  determined in fish above 45 cm consistent with female fish. These results
  indicate inter-species variation between the plasma vitellogenin concentrations
  of A. anguilla and other published fish studies undertaken along the same
  estuaries.

AB: A pilot study of water quality and household characteristics (e.g.
  sanitation and risk of enteric diseases) was carried out as a basis to promote
  the development of environmental health indicators in Mexico City, Mexico. 2
  areas of Mexico City were studied, the western and southern areas, and a
  geographical information system (GIS) used to identify wells and surrounding
  homesteads within a 0.5 km radius. During the rainy season (June-October 1999),
  1250 households were visited on a random sample basis; those with children
  under 5 years of age were interviewed. Data on diarrhoeal disease occurring
  within the previous 2 wk was obtained for 950 children, and their guardians
  provided details about water supply, sanitation and socioeconomics. 320 water
  samples were collected from 40 wells throughout the 2 areas and tested for
  levels of total coliforms, faecal coliforms, Escherichia coli and faecal
  streptococci. Bacterial indicators were detected in 40% of wells in the western
  area and 32% of wells in the southern area (P = 0.01). Rate of diarrhoeal
  disease was higher for children from the southern than the western area (OR =
  1.7 and 95% CI 0.99, 2.86); the former group showed a higher risk of diarrhoea
  if they lived in rented rather than owned dwellings (OR = 1.7 and 95% CI: 1.04,
  2.77). Risk was highest for children in houses with poor sanitation facilities
  (e.g. latrine) than those connected to a sewerage system (OR = 1.7 and 95% CI
  1.00, 2.93). Children from households perceiving unpleasant tasting water
  showed a higher risk than those without complaints (OR = 2.2 and 95% CI 1.28,
  3.75). It is concluded that enteric diseases represent a health problem in
  poorer communities of Mexico City, and that dwelling and sanitary deficiencies
  strongly influence the risk of diarrhoea in children.

AB: Previous data indicating wide racial disparities in HIV seroprevalence,
  associations between sentinel sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and HIV
  infection, and recent reports of STD outbreaks among men who have sex with men
  (MSM) have raised concerns that HIV may be resurgent among MSM. To measure
  trends in HIV seroprevalence and describe racial disparities among MSM
  presenting to New York City Department of Health STD clinics, 1990-1999 (n =
  4076). This blinded HIV-1 serosurvey used remnant serum originally drawn for
  routine serologic tests for syphilis. Demographic, risk factor, clinical and
  laboratory data were abstracted from clinic charts of patients whose medical
  records documented sexual contact with men or with both men and women
  ("bisexual" men). Data were matched to the specimens, and all personal
  identifiers were removed before testing. Patients were not interviewed. The
  sample was 41% black, 20% Hispanic, 31% white, and 9% of other or mixed
  race/ethnicity. Sixty-one percent of the patients were >30 years of age; 21%
  were greater than or equal to 40 years of age. One-third had sex with women as
  well as men. For 60%, laboratory-confirmed STD diagnosis was made on the
  serosurvey visit. Overall, HIV seroprevalence declined from 47% in 1990 to 18%
  in 1999 (P < 0.01). Seroprevalence declined from 34% to 11% among white men (n
  = 1250), from 47% to 19% among Hispanic men (n = 795), from 56% to 28% among
  black men (n = 1656), and from 43% to 14% among men who had sex with both men
  and women (n = 1447). Seroprevalence among MSM with gonorrhea (n = 507)
  declined but remained high (57-34%; P < 0.05). In contrast, seroprevalence
  among MSM with nongonococcal urethritis (n = 953) declined from 36% to 16% (P <
  0.01), and seroprevalence among MSM who had no STD (n = 1650) dropped from 48%
  to 12% (P < 0.01). Gonorrhea was diagnosed almost twice as frequently among
  seropositive versus seronegative MSM (19% versus 10%; P < 0.05). Black MSM were
  not more or less likely to have been tested for HIV or to be diagnosed with
  acute STD than were MSM in the other-race/ethnicity group. Positive serostatus
  was associated with black race/ethnicity (odds ratio [OR], 2.5; 95% CI, 2.1
  -2.9), age >25 years (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.9-3.1), and a diagnosis of gonorrhea
  (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 2.0-2.8). Sixty percent of seropositive MSM knew their
  serostatus from confidential or anonymous HIV testing at this or a previous
  visit. Two thirds of the known seropositive men had a new STD diagnosed at the
  serosurvey visit. Seroprevalence in this racially diverse sample of MSM
  declined significantly during the study period. However, wide racial
  disparities in seroprevalence were observed that were not attributable to
  disparities in risk factors such as STD, bisexuality, or acceptance of HIV
  testing. This finding suggests that the observed differences may reflect racial
  differences in the background seroprevalences, such as those seen in all New
  York City serosurvey samples and the population-based AIDS case rates. High
  prevalence associated with gonorrhea and new STD in known seropositive men of
  any race suggests that continued efforts to control the incidence of STD,
  increased encouragement of MSM to accept HIV counseling and testing, and
  prevention-focused counseling of seropositive men are needed.

AB: The aim of this study was to begin evaluating the utility of sand crabs
  (Emerita analoga) as an indicator species for the algal neurotoxin, domoic acid
  (DA), in Monterey Bay, California, USA, a site of recurrent blooms of the DA
  -producing diatom, Pseudo-nitzschia. One of the current sentinel organisms, the
  sea mussel (Mytilus californianus), has shown minimal or undetectable toxicity
  during some local bloom events. As a critical step in assuring the accuracy of
  DA determinations in E. analoga, we have developed and validated a highly
  efficient extraction protocol that yields toxin recoveries of 97 plus or minus
  2.9%. We also determined by HPLC-UV and receptor binding assay, with
  confirmation by LC-MS/MS, that sand crabs accumulated measurable amounts of DA
  during toxic Pseudo-nitzschia blooms, while the sea mussel showed no detectable
  toxin. In addition, a comparison of inter-animal variability in DA content
  revealed values ranging from ca. 0.5 to 5 mu g DA g super(-1) tissue and no
  consistent trend with size class, based on either animal weight or length.
  These data on the toxicity of individual animals will be useful in designing an
  appropriate sampling strategy for monitoring DA and, importantly, indicate that
  sand crabs do not appear to progressively bioaccumulate DA with age.

AB: Within the scope of the multidisciplinary research project Valimar (1995
  -1999), the present study emphasizes the use of histopathological
  investigations to evaluate the effects of the different chemical impact of two
  small streams on the general health and condition of the two sentinel fish
  species, brown trout (Salmo trutta f. fario) and loach (Barbatula barbatula).
  Parasitological investigations were also included to assess a possible
  relationship between toxicant exposure, parasitic load, and the occurrence of
  histopathological organ changes. According to the multitiered approach of the
  Valimar project, fish from the field, individuals exposed to stream water under
  semi-field conditions, and fish from laboratory experiments were investigated.
  Under semi-field conditions, the histopathological responses in brown trout
  proved to reflect the different levels of contamination of the two small
  streams more clearly than those detected in loach. When captured from the
  field, both fish species revealed, in most cases, a higher degree of
  histopathological alterations than those individuals exposed at the respective
  site under semi-field conditions. Simulation of the toxic load of the more
  polluted stream in a laboratory experiment did not result in the same kind of
  tissue lesions in brown trout as in the field and semi-field investigations.
  Whereas results from the laboratory experiments could be specified as "toxicant
  -induced", the histopathological alterations in fish from both semi-field and
  field studies represent stress responses which integrate the effects of various
  abiotic and biotic stress factors including both toxicants and parasitic
  diseases.

AB: The effect of host weed phenology, abundance, and diversity and natural
  enemies on the population dynamics of the southern green stink bug, Nezara
  viridula (L.), in Hawaiian macadamia orchards was investigated. We found that
  the highest kernel damage occurred immediately following abrupt reductions in
  the flowering and fruiting stages of host weeds. Areas with the greatest
  diversity of host weeds showed higher damage, presumably because of higher N.
  viridula population levels. Predation rates on sentinel egg masses were highest
  over the two seasons in areas where the bigheaded ant, Pheidole megacephala
  (F.), comprised a large portion of the ant fauna. In one of the orchards, P.
  megacephala and the longlegged ant, Anoplolepis longipes (Jerdon), occurred in
  a spatial mosaic where the boundaries shifted back and forth over time.
  Sentinel egg masses placed in these two adjacent areas showed predation rates
  were highest in the areas dominated by P. megacephala, and intermediate in the
  interface zone and lowest where only A. longipes were found. The importance of
  weed phenology and natural enemy induced mortality is discussed.

AB: The objective of this study was to explore whether the differences in rate
  of spread of HIV in different regions in sub-Saharan Africa could be explained
  by differences in sexual behaviour and/or factors influencing the probability
  of HIV transmission during sexual intercourse. A cross-sectional, population
  -based study was conducted in two cities with a high HIV prevalence (Kisumu in
  Kenya and Ndola in Zambia) and two cities with a relatively low HIV prevalence
  (Cotonou in Benin and Yaounde in Cameroon). In each of these cities,
  approximately 1000 men and 1000 women, aged 15-49 years, were randomly selected
  from the general population. Consenting men and women were interviewed and were
  tested for HIV, syphilis, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), gonorrhoea,
  chlamydial infection and trichomoniasis (the latter for women only). In
  addition, a survey was conducted on a random sample of 300 sex workers in each
  city. The research instruments, including the questionnaires and the laboratory
  procedures, were standardized to permit comparison of results. The numbers of
  men interviewed were 1021 in Cotonou, 973 in Yaounde, 829 in Kisumu, and 720 in
  Ndola. The corresponding figures for women were 1095, 1116, 1060 and 1130. In
  Yaounde, Kisumu and Ndola, the response rates for men were lower than for women
  due to failure to make contact with eligible men. The proportion of eligible
  women who were interviewed was 86% in Yaounde, and 89% in Kisumu and Ndola. In
  Yaounde, 76% of eligible men were interviewed, along with 82% in Kisumu and 75%
  in Ndola. The prevalence of HIV infection in men was 3.3% in Cotonou, 4.1% in
  Yaounde, 19.8% in Kisumu and 23.2% in Ndola. For women, the respective figures
  were 3.4, 7.8, 30.1 and 31.9%. The prevalence of HIV infection among women aged
  15-19 years was 23.0% in Kisumu and 15.4% in Ndola. Among women in Kisumu who
  had their sexual debut 5 years before the interview, the prevalence of HIV
  infection was 46%; in Ndola, it was 59%. Among sex workers, the prevalence of
  HIV infection was 57.5% in Cotonou, 34.4% in Yaounde, 74.7% in Kisumu and 68.7%
  in Ndola. The HIV prevalence rates in the general population confirmed our
  preliminary assessment of the level of HIV infection in the four cities, which
  was based on estimates of HIV prevalence from sentinel surveillance among
  pregnant women. The very high prevalence of HIV infection among young women in
  Kisumu and Ndola calls for urgent intervention.

AB: PURPOSE: To investigate the feasibility, toxicity, cosmetic outcome, and
  local control of high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy alone without whole breast
  external beam irradiation for early-stage breast carcinoma. METHODS AND
  MATERIALS: Between June 1997 and August 1999, 32 women diagnosed with a total
  of 33 AJCC Stage I/II breast carcinomas underwent surgical breast excision and
  postoperative irradiation using HDR brachytherapy interstitial implantation as
  part of a multi-institutional clinical Phase I/II protocol. Eligible patients
  included those with T1, T2, N0, N1 (< or =3 nodes positive), and M0 tumors of
  nonlobular histologic features with negative surgical margins, no extracapsular
  lymph node extension, and a negative postexcision mammogram. Brachytherapy
  catheters were placed at the initial excision, reexcision, or either sentinel
  or full-axillary sampling. Direct visualization, surgical clips, and ultrasound
  and/or CT scan assisted in the delineation of the target volume, defined as the
  excision cavity plus a 2-cm margin. High-activity 192Ir (3-10 Ci) was used to
  deliver 340 cGy/fraction, 2 fractions/d, for 5 consecutive days, to a total
  dose of 34 Gy to the target volume. Source position and dwell times were
  calculated using standard volume optimization techniques. RESULTS: The median
  follow-up of all patients was 33 months, and the mean patient age was 63 years.
  The mean tumor size was 1.3 cm, and 55% had an extensive intraductal component.
  Three patients had positive axillary nodes. Two patients experienced moderate
  perioperative pain that required narcotic analgesics. No peri- or postoperative
  infections occurred. No wound healing problems and no significant skin
  reactions related to the implant developed. The Radiation Therapy Oncology
  Group late radiation morbidity scoring scheme was applied to the entire 33-case
  cohort. In the assessment of the skin, 30 cases were Grade 0-1 and 3 cases were
  Grade 2. Subcutaneous toxicity was scored as 11 patients with Grade 0, 3 with
  Grade 1, 8 with Grade 2, 3 with Grade 3, and 8 with Grade 4. Clinically evident
  fat necrosis occurred in 8 patients at a median of 7.5 months after HDR
  brachytherapy completion. The only variables significantly associated with
  Grade 3-4 toxicity were the number of source dwell positions and the volume of
  tissue encompassed by the prescription isodose shell. The global cosmetic
  scores after a minimum of 18 months' follow-up were 0 cases with poor, 4 with
  fair, 5 with good, and 24 with excellent scores. One case of ipsilateral breast
  tumor recurrence was diagnosed 23 months after HDR brachytherapy, for a 4-year
  actuarial recurrence rate of 3%. This failure appeared to be a new primary
  tumor, because it was histologically distinct from the initial tumor and was
  located 9 cm from the initial tumor bed and 3 cm from the edge of the implant
  volume. CONCLUSION: Radiotherapy of the tumor bed alone with HDR interstitial
  brachytherapy is associated with a 33% incidence of Grade 3-4 s.c. toxicity,
  but with generally favorable overall cosmetic results. The risk of toxicity
  appears to be primarily related to the implant volume. With limited follow-up,
  the incidence of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence was low.

AB: Iodine-129 is routinely released in the gaseous and liquid low-level
  radioactive effluents of nuclear spent fuel reprocessing plants. Environmental
  impact assessment of these discharges are performed based on monitoring samples
  of different types of natural indicators. Thyroid is considered as a relevant
  organ to monitor radioactive iodine isotopes. In this study, bovine thyroids
  were collected in herds located in the Cotentin area under the influence of
  authorized low level gaseous effluents of the La Hague nuclear fuel
  -reprocessing plant. For low level 129I/127I ratios, characteristic of
  environmental samples (10(-12) to 10(-7)), RNAA or SMA that includes important
  radiochemical preparation steps are used. This paper demonstrates the interest
  of direct gamma-X spectrometry to measure 129I activities, associated to INAA
  to measure 127I to attain higher ratios levels (10(-6) to 10(-4)). This study
  shows the interest of monitoring bovine thyroids considered as sentinel organs
  to characterize the dispersion in space and time of 129I discharged in low
  level radioactive gaseous effluents by the La Hague reprocessing plant.

AB: In fish, the embryos and larvae are the life-stages most sensitive to damage
  from environmentally borne dioxin-like compounds and polycyclic aromatic
  hydrocarbons (PAHs). Methods are not routinely available to measure the body
  burdens of contaminants in embryos and larvae, thus precluding the
  investigation of links between exposure and biological effects. Quantification
  of expression of cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1) provides an index of relative
  exposure of natural populations to bioavailable aromatic hydrocarbons (AH) and
  an initial evaluation of their biological effects. We developed a quantitative
  approach to standardize total RNA loading and then used competitive reverse
  transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to quantify the CYP1A1 mRNA
  expression in environmentally exposed Atlantic tomcod (Microgadus tomcod) post
  yolk-sac larvae (postlarvae) from the Hudson River, New York, and in chemically
  treated postlarval offspring of controlled laboratory crosses of Hudson River
  parents. Significant induction of CYP1A1 expression was observed in tomcod
  postlarvae exposed to waterborne 3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB 77) (four
  -fold) and benzo[a]-pyrene (eight-fold) compared with vehicle-exposed controls.
  In contrast, CYP1A1 was not induced in Hudson River-exposed postlarvae compared
  with vehicle-exposed controls. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using
  competitive RT-PCR for the measurement of gene expression in environmentally
  exposed larvae of sentinel species, and is consistent with the hypothesis that
  postlarvae exposed to the Hudson River environment have not bioaccumulated
  sufficient levels of AHs to induce CYP1A1 expression. The high levels of
  hepatic CYP1A1 mRNA expression previously reported in 5-8 month old juvenile
  tomcod from the Hudson River coincides with their descent to the benthic
  habitat and the onset of independent feeding on AH-contaminated benthic prey.

AB: PROBLEM/CONDITION: Cases of work-related asthma (WRA) are sentinel health
  events that indicate the need for preventive intervention. WRA includes new
  -onset asthma caused by workplace exposure to sensitizers or irritants and
  preexisting asthma exacerbated by workplace exposures. REPORTING PERIOD: This
  report reviews cases of WRA identified by state health departments from January
  1, 1993, through December 31, 1995, as well as follow-up investigations of
  cases and associated workplaces conducted through June 30, 1998. DESCRIPTION OF
  THE SYSTEMS: State-based surveillance and intervention programs for WRA are
  conducted in California, Massachusetts, Michigan, and New Jersey as part of the
  Sentinel Event Notification Systems for Occupational Risks (SENSOR) cooperative
  agreement program, initiated by CDC's National Institute for Occupational
  Safety and Health (NIOSH). RESULTS: From 1993 through 1995, a total of 1,101
  cases of WRA were identified by SENSOR surveillance staff members in
  California, Massachusetts, Michigan, and New Jersey. Of these 1,101 cases,
  19.1% were classified as work-aggravated asthma, and 80.9% were classified as
  new-onset asthma. Objective evidence substantiating asthma work-relatedness was
  documented in the medical records of 3.4% of WRA cases identified in the two
  states (Michigan and New Jersey) where medical records are routinely reviewed
  for this information. Indoor air pollutants, dusts, cleaning materials,
  lubricants (e.g., metalworking fluids), and diisocyanates were among the most
  frequently reported causes of WRA. In addition, a well-recognized cause of
  occupational asthma - natural rubber latex - was identified in a new setting,
  the healthcare industry. The most common industries associated with WRA cases
  included transportation equipment manufacturing (19.3%), health services
  (14.2%), and educational services (8.7%). Air sampling for agents known to
  induce occupational asthma was performed in Michigan for comparison with
  established federal time-weighted average exposure limits. Sixteen (13.4%) of
  119 workplaces tested had airborne concentrations exceeding NIOSH recommended
  exposure limits (RELs); 11 (9.1%) of 121 workplaces had concentrations
  exceeding permissible exposure limits (PELs) of the Michigan Occupational
  Safety and Health Act (MIOSHA) program. INTERPRETATION: The surveillance data
  findings confirm well-recognized causes of asthma and have identified new
  putative causes (e.g., cleaning materials and metalworking fluids). Because the
  surveillance program depends on physicians' recognizing asthma work-relatedness
  and reporting diagnosed cases, the data are considered an underestimate of the
  magnitude of the WRA problem. The data also indicate that physicians are not
  commonly performing objective physiologic tests to substantiate a WRA
  diagnosis. Workplace findings suggest a need to evaluate existing exposure
  standards for specific agents known to induce occupational asthma (e.g.,
  diisocyanates). Case-based surveillance can help improve the recognition,
  control, and prevention of WRA. The SENSOR model also provides a mechanism for
  workers and physicians to request workplace investigations aimed at primary
  prevention for other workers. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: NIOSH and state health
  department representatives are working to establish a long-term agenda for
  state-based surveillance of work-related conditions and hazards. The results
  from the SENSOR WRA programs described in this report support inclusion of WRA
  as a priority condition warranting surveillance at the state level.

AB: The procedure of sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with malignant
  cutaneous melanoma has evolved from the notion that the tumor drains in a
  logical way through the lymphatic system, from the first to subsequent levels.
  As a consequence, the first lymph node encountered (the sentinel node) will
  most likely be the first affected by metastasis; therefore, a negative sentinel
  node makes it highly unlikely that other nodes in the same lymphatic basin are
  affected. Although the long-term therapeutic benefit of the sentinel lymph node
  biopsy per se has not yet been ascertained, this procedure distinguishes
  patients without nodal metastases, who can avoid nodal basin dissection with
  its associated risk of lymphedema, from those with metastatic involvement, who
  may benefit from additional therapy. Sentinel lymph node biopsy would represent
  a significant advantage as a minimally invasive procedure, considering that an
  average of only 20% of melanoma patients with a Breslow thickness between 1.5
  and 4 mm harbor metastasis in their sentinel node and are therefore candidates
  for elective lymph node dissection. Furthermore, histologic sampling errors
  (amounting to approximately 12% of lymph nodes in the conventional routine) can
  be reduced if one assesses a single (sentinel) node extensively rather than
  assessing the standard few histologic sections in a high number of lymph nodes
  per patient. The cells from which cutaneous melanomas originate are located
  between the dermis and the epidermis, a zone that drains to the inner lymphatic
  network in the reticular dermis and, in turn, to larger collecting lymphatics
  in the subcutis. Therefore, the optimal route for interstitial administration
  of radiocolloids for lymphoscintigraphy and subsequent radioguided sentinel
  lymph node biopsy is intradermal or subdermal injection. (99m)Tc-Labeled
  colloids in various size ranges are equally adequate for radioguided sentinel
  lymph node biopsy in patients with cutaneous melanoma, depending on local
  experience and availability. For melanomas along the midline of the head, neck,
  and trunk, particular consideration should be given to ambiguous lymphatic
  drainage, which frequently requires interstitial administration virtually all
  around the tumor or surgical scar from prior excision of the melanoma.
  Lymphoscintigraphy is an essential part of radioguided sentinel lymph node
  biopsy because images are used to direct the surgeon to the sites of the nodes.
  The sentinel lymph node should have a significantly higher count than that of
  the background (at least 10:1 intraoperatively). After removal of the sentinel
  node, the surgical bed must be reexamined to ensure that all radioactive sites
  are identified and removed for analysis. Virtually the entire sentinel lymph
  node should be processed for histopathology, including both conventional
  hematoxylin-eosin staining and immune staining with antibodies to the S-100 and
  HMB-45 antigens. The success rate of radioguidance in localizing the sentinel
  lymph node in melanoma patients is approximately 98% in institutions that
  perform a high number of procedures and approaches 99% when combined with the
  vital blue-dye technique. Growing evidence of the high correlation between a
  sentinel lymph node biopsy negative for cancer and a negative status for the
  lymphatic basin-evidence, therefore, of the high prognostic value of sentinel
  node biopsy-has led to the procedure's being included in the most recent
  version of the TNM staging system and starting to become the standard of care
  for patients with cutaneous melanoma.

AB: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are xenobiotics whose elevated toxicity for
  living organisms requires to efficiently monitor air pollution, either by
  evaluating their levels in the environment, or by assessing their biological
  impacts on sentinel organisms. We investigated the effects of naphthalene
  exposure on some xenobiotic-metabolising enzyme activities in three organs of
  Helix aspersa. Particular activities depending on cytochrome P450
  (ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase, EROD; ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase, ECOD;
  pentoxyresorufin O-dealkylase, PROD) and associated with glutathione
  (glutathione S-transferase, GST; glutathione peroxidase, GPX; glutathione
  reductase, GR) were assessed. In control animals, the P450-dependent specific
  activities were distributed according to the range kidney > digestive gland >
  mantle cavity forming tissues (MCFT). Neither ECOD nor PROD activities could be
  detected in MCFT. In the two other organs, the major phase I activities were
  due to ECOD, the level of PROD being very low or null. The glutathione
  -associated activities showed comparable levels in the three organs, except GPX
  activity that was higher in the digestive gland. Naphthalene (NAP) exposure did
  not affect any activity in MCFT, but it significantly decreased EROD and ECOD
  activities in the kidney as opposed to their increase in the digestive gland,
  whereas PROD activities were not influenced by the treatment. Glutathione
  -dependent activities were not significantly affected by NAP exposure, except
  for GPX which activity diminished in the digestive gland. This study
  demonstrates that complex detoxification pathways should exist in Helix aspersa
  as in mammals and that they could be used as potential biomarkers of NAP
  exposure.

AB: Cancerbioassays have demonstrated the carcinogenic activity of vinyl acetate
  in rodents. Tumors appear only at the site of contact and mechanistic data
  suggest that the carcinogenic mechanism involves carboxylesterase-mediated
  metabolism of vinyl acetate to acetic acid. It has been hypothesized that
  intracellular formation of acetate causes a reduction of intracellular pH
  (pH(i)) at noncytotoxic levels, but that prolonged exposure to reduced pH(i) is
  cytotoxic and/or mitogenic and drives proliferative responses. Coupled with
  exposure to metabolically formed acetaldehyde at high administered
  concentrations, nonlinear dose-response curves for epithelial tumors are
  produced. Freshly isolated rat hepatocytes were used as a model system to test
  the concept that exposure of cells to vinyl acetate causes a reduction in
  pH(i). Quantitative fluorescence imaging ratio microscopy showed that exposure
  of hepatocytes to vinyl acetate concentrations ranging from 10 to 1000 microM
  caused rapid and sustained reductions of approximately 0.03 to 0.65 pH units.
  Cellular acidification was rapidly reversed to control pH(i) upon removal of
  vinyl acetate. There was minimal accumulation of protons during the exposure
  period, as suggested by minor differences in pH(i) of cells with or without
  prior exposure to vinyl acetate. The effect of vinyl acetate on pH(i) was
  attenuated by prior exposure to the carboxylesterase inhibitor bis(p
  -nitrophenyl)phosphate. These results support the concept that intracellular
  acidification is a sentinel pharmacodynamic response of cells to vinyl acetate
  exposure and that pH(i) is an appropriate metric dose for use in quantitative
  risk assessments of cancer and noncancer human health risk assessment.

AB: Nonhuman organisms are being exposed to ionizing radiations at radionuclide
  -contaminated sites around the world. Direct methods are seldom available for
  measuring biologically relevant doses received by these organisms. Here we
  extend biological dosimetry techniques, which are much better developed for
  humans and a few other mammalian species, to a nonmammalian species. Turtles
  were chosen because a long-lived animal would best serve the need for low
  -level, chronic exposure conditions. We chose the yellow-bellied slider turtle
  (Trachemys scripta), which is known to have a maximum life span of at least 22
  years. As reported elsewhere, we first isolated an embryonic fibroblast cell
  line and constructed whole-chromosome-specific DNA libraries for chromosome 1
  by microdissection and PCR. A FISH painting probe was prepared and used to
  establish a dose-response curve for ionizing radiation-induced chromosome
  interchange aberrations in turtle fibroblasts. This was compared to the dose
  response for human fibroblasts treated under similar conditions in our
  laboratory. With respect to induction of chromosome interchange aberrations,
  human fibroblasts were approximately 1.7 times more sensitive than the T.
  scripta fibroblasts. To the extent that symmetrical interchanges are persistent
  over long periods, this approach could eventually provide a measure of the
  integrated lifetime dose these organisms receive from radionuclides in their
  environment and give a measure of the extent of relevant genetic damage over
  that time.

  during some local bloom events. As a critical step in assuring the accuracy of
  DA determinations in E. analoga, we have developed and validated a highly
  efficient extraction protocol that yields toxin recoveries of 97+/-2.9%. We
  also determined by HPLC-UV and receptor binding assay, with confirmation by LC
  -MS/MS, that sand crabs accumulated measurable amounts of DA during toxic
  Pseudo-nitzschia blooms, while the sea mussel showed no detectable toxin. In
  addition, a comparison of inter-animal variability in DA content revealed
  values ranging from ca. 0.5 to 5 microg DAg(-1) tissue and no consistent trend
  with size class, based on either animal weight or length. These data on the
  toxicity of individual animals will be useful in designing an appropriate
  sampling strategy for monitoring DA and, importantly, indicate that sand crabs
  do not appear to progressively bioaccumulate DA with age.

AB: Bucephaloides gracilescens is a common parasite in the intestine of the
  angler fish Lophiuspiscatorius, and the metacercariae have been recorded from a
  number of gadoid intermediate hosts. In a toxicokinetic study of lindane (gamma
  -hexachlorocyclohexane) in bullrout Myoxocephalus scorpius, metacercariae of B.
  gracilescens were found in the central nervous system (CNS). Furthermore, the
  metacercariae accumulated concentrations of lindane that were higher than in
  the surrounding CNS tissue. This is the first report of metacercariae of B.
  gracilescens in bullrout. In addition the present results contribute knowledge
  of the disposition of an important environmental contaminant in the
  metacercarial stage of a trematode that has been pointed out as a promising
  sentinel species of pollution in the marine environment.

  acetylcholinesterase (AChE, EC 3.1.1.7, acetylcholine acetylhydrolase) of two
  teleosts was examined. Caged Cyprinus carpio and field-captured Cnesterodon
  decemmaculatus were used as sentinel organisms. Eserine concentration
  inhibiting 50% of AChE activity (IC50) and inhibition kinetic parameters were
  also evaluated. Interspecies IC50 differences were found to agree with observed
  kinetic parameters (KA, ki and kc), indicating that carps were more sensitive
  to eserine. Data obtained disclosed spatial differences and demonstrated the
  high sensitivity of AChE activity as an exposure biomarker. Marked species
  -related differences were detected, showing that enzyme determination of C.
  decemmaculatus is more effective in highly polluted sites. Considering the
  river water physicochemical profile, observed changes in AChE activities can be
  partly attributed to long-lasting raised concentrations of dissolved heavy
  metals.

AB: OBJECTIVES: To compare retrospectively the treatment results of surveillance
  and primary retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) of patients with
  clinical Stage I nonseminomatous germ cell tumors of the testis (NSGCT) in two
  institutions in The Netherlands. METHODS: From 1982 to 1994, 90 consecutive
  patients with clinical Stage I NSGCT were prospectively entered in a
  surveillance protocol in Amsterdam (group 1). In the same period, 101 patients
  with clinical Stage I NSGCT underwent primary RPLND in Nijmegen (group 2). Both
  patient populations were comparable for patient age, presence of vascular
  invasion, and embryonal cell components in the primary tumor. All patients in
  group 1 with relapse, except for 2, were treated with cisplatin-based
  chemotherapy. All patients in group 2 with vital tumor in the RPLND specimen
  were treated with two adjuvant courses of combined chemotherapy (cisplatin,
  etoposide, and bleomycin). RESULTS: In group 1, at a median follow-up of 7.7
  years, 23 patients (26%) had relapse. The median time to relapse was 12 months.
  Relapses were located retroperitoneally (n = 18, 78%), in the lung (n = 3,
  13%), scrotally (n = 1, 4%), and combined in the liver, lung, and pleura (n =
  1, 4%). After treatment of relapses (chemotherapy in 21 and/or surgery in 11),
  only 1 patient died of disseminated disease. A disease-free survival rate of
  98.5% was achieved at the median follow-up. The main toxicities consisted of
  short-lasting leukopenia, accompanied by infection (13%). Four patients
  reported cardiovascular and four neuropathy complaints. In group 2, the median
  follow-up was 6.9 years. In 31 patients (30.7%), vital tumor was found
  retroperitoneally; after two courses of combined chemotherapy, none of them had
  a relapse. Seven patients with pathologic Stage I disease (6.4%) had a
  pulmonary relapse within 1 year after surgery. No retroperitoneal relapses were
  found. After chemotherapy, 6 patients with relapse were salvaged, and 1 died of
  disseminated disease. The disease-specific survival rate in group 2 was 98% at
  the median follow-up. The most frequent surgical complications were lymphocele
  (n = 3), small bowel obstruction (n = 3), and abdominal pain (n = 3). The
  antegrade ejaculation rate was 94%. CONCLUSIONS: Excellent treatment results in
  terms of disease-free survival can be achieved in Stage I NSGCT with both
  surveillance and primary RPLND. Patients with pathologic Stage II disease
  adjuvantly treated with chemotherapy did not have any relapse and consequently
  all survived. Most complications after both treatment strategies are
  reversible. The choice of treatment should be based on balanced information and
  not on dogmatic principles.

AB: Chemical intolerance (CI) is an individual difference trait in which persons
  report feeling ill in multiple physiological systems from low levels of a wide
  range of chemically unrelated environmental substances. This paper discusses
  the neural sensitization model for progressive host amplification of
  polysymptomatic responses elicited by chemical exposures following an
  initiating event. The sensitization model accommodates hypotheses for
  initiating and eliciting CI in human populations that involve both
  environmental chemicals and physical or psychological stressors. Recent studies
  in this laboratory have demonstrated sensitization in individuals with CI over
  repeated sessions for dependent variables such as electroencephalographic (EEG)
  activity and diastolic blood pressure. Psychological distress variables alone
  do not explain these findings. Individuals with CI and/or vulnerability to
  sensitization share specific characteristics, for example, female gender,
  certain genetic background (offspring of alcohol-preferring parents), and
  personal preference for high sugar/ carbohydrate intake. Overall, the data
  suggest that the 15-30% of the general population who report heightened CI are
  highly sensitizable. Sensitizability may serve an adaptive, sentinel function
  in threatening environments with poor signal-to-noise ratios. However, as
  sensitization gradually shifts operating set points of physiological systems
  out of the normal range in response to allostatic load, this process may
  contribute to the development of chronic, polysymptomatic health conditions
  such as multiple chemical sensitivity and/or fibromyalgia. Individual response
  specificity and stereotypy rather than toxicant properties may determine which
  types of central, autonomic, and/or peripheral nervous system dysfunctions
  manifest at subclinical and clinical levels.

AB: Work-related deaths are important "sentinel events" of unsuccessful
  prevention. In Italy the most exhaustive source of such events is the National
  Fund for Occupational Diseases (INAIL), but the amount of cases from this
  source seems to be underestimated due to the fact that it refers only to cases
  occurred to subjects insured by the Fund. A previous survey estimated the real
  amount of work-related deaths 10-20% higher than that quantified by INAIL. This
  study evaluated the contribute of the two most important sources (INAIL and the
  Regional Mortality Registry of Tuscany-RMR) in estimating the number of these
  cases in Tuscany in the period 1992-96. Cases were identified from each source,
  and then it was applied a capture-recapture method to size the cases from work
  -related accident different from road accidents. RMR appeared to be the most
  exhaustive source with 72.3% completeness versus 56.4% completeness of INAIL
  source. Nevertheless the last one must be considered the primary source, more
  specific and accurate, and since few years also timely, than any other one.
  Work-related deaths from road accident represent 35.9% of INAIL cases but they
  are difficult to be identified from RMR and were not considered in this study.
  In conclusion the mortality data should be used for an epidemiologic
  surveillance system on work-related deaths not due to road accident in order to
  identify cases occurred to subjects not insured by INAIL (and therefore not
  defined by the Fund). These deaths are also important in terms of public
  health. Cases identified only from RMR, occurred in Tuscany in 1992-96, were
  155: the vast majority occurred to farmers (mainly pensioners, and due to
  caterpillar upsetting), to bricklayers, to railway workers, to soldiers and to
  entrepreneurs.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To assess drug use and the incidence of mild to moderate adverse
  drug effects (AE) in children aged 0 - 16 years, with 2 different approaches.
  METHODS: All 185 pediatric practices in the State of Brandenburg, Germany, were
  surveyed (95% positive response). A random sample of 50 practices servicing
  36,000 children participated in the study as sentinel physicians reporting any
  AE among their patients. Twenty practices servicing 14,000 children were
  included in a drug utilization component (DUC) which documented diagnoses,
  prescribing and AE in all children seen in a 3-month period. RESULTS: The
  results on the DUC are based on 12,628 children with 26,168 physician contacts,
  34,465 diagnoses and 33,140 drug prescriptions given to 85% of the children
  seen (average age: 6.7 years). Practice size ranged from 94 to 1,473 children
  seen in a 3-month period. The average number of physician contacts per child
  was 2. 1, with 10% seeing a physician 5 times and more. The diagnoses were
  respiratory ailments (30%), skin- (12%), injection- (11%) and trauma- (10%)
  related diagnoses. Major drug uses were respiratory (34% of prescriptions),
  anti-infective (22%), dermatological (13%), gastrointestinal (9%) and
  psychotropic agents (8%). One hundred and fifty-two AE affecting 150 children
  were documented in the DUC, 60% of these occurring within 3 days after
  treatment initiation. 83% of AE were mild (up to 4 on a scale from I -6), and
  85% were considered by physicians to be attributable. Only 4 reports of very
  severe events were received. 47% of reports were related to antibiotic uses,
  31% to immunizations, 11% to respiratory, and 4% to gastrointestinal agents.
  While there are no differences in the occurrence of AE by gender, AE decreases
  significantly by age, maintaining the same patterns of AE type and causative
  medication. Over a 3-month period, the incidence of mild to moderate ADR in
  children given medications is estimated as 1,200 per 100,000, or about 1%.
  CONCLUSIONS: Underreporting of AE remains an issue even when a monitoring
  scheme suggests compliance. The results of this study show that while AE in
  children are generally non-serious, 1% of treatments might elicit mild AE
  leading to a consultation. Direct practice recording produces more reports than
  a sentinel system.

AB: Patient safety has assumed a prominent role on the policy agenda since the
  Institute of Medicine report To Err Is Human was released in November 1999. The
  report maintained that medical error is the predominant mechanism by which
  patients in the United States and around the world are injured. This finding,
  along with the report's recommendation for a "systems" approach to reducing
  medical error, provided an extremely important insight into the operation of
  our medical delivery system. Clearly, while advances in medical technology,
  diagnostic techniques, and knowledge provide the foundation for saving lives,
  medical error has resulted in their loss. However, recognition that medical
  error is a primary cause of these avoidable patient injuries and deaths is a
  key one and may result in improvements within our system of health-care
  delivery as well as minimization of the emotional and financial toll that
  iatrogenic injury causes. This paper reviews some of these impediments and
  offers suggestions for reform. In Part I, the current status of error in
  medicine is outlined, and the fundamentals of error theory are reviewed,
  including the generative aspects of error; the "holes," or failures, in each
  barrier that may allow errors to slip through and result in adverse events; and
  the need for a non-punitive, cooperative environment that focuses on systems,
  not individuals, to reduce errors. The "holes" leading to medical error are
  then explored in more detail. The paper first evaluates the medical efforts to
  reduce injury and error, including the traditional, and inappropriate,
  individually oriented "shame-and-blame" method; continuing education in medical
  risk management; and the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare
  Organizations' Sentinel Event Policy; and concludes that these efforts do not
  provide the benefits hoped for them. The paper then assesses the predominant
  legal issues that affect efforts to reduce injury and error -- namely, the
  medical malpractice liability system, evidentiary rules regarding privilege,
  contract and tort law for independent contractors, and the Health Insurance
  Portability and Accountability Act. From the analysis, it is concluded that the
  legal system may deter efforts to study safety, with the medical malpractice
  system in fact potentially increasing the risk of error and patient injury.

AB: Under the Canadian Fisheries Act, pulp and paper mills and metal mines must
  conduct a cyclical monitoring program for potential environmental effects that
  includes a fish survey. Study designs for the fish survey have been evolving
  over the past few years, and there has been increased emphasis on the use of
  small-bodied fish species. Increasing concerns about the potential impacts of
  sampling programs on the fish populations in smaller receiving waters have led
  us to develop non-lethal sampling methodologies that will satisfy the
  information requirements for the environmental effects monitoring program. This
  manuscript outlines the use of a non-lethal sampling program to collect
  information on age distributions, growth rates, reproductive performance and
  fish condition in populations of slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus) inhabiting
  forested and agricultural sections of a small New Brunswick river.

AB: We used a simulated gizzard environment to examine the bioavailability of
  barium, cadmium, copper, lead and zinc to wild and sentinel mallards (Anas
  platyrhynchos) using a seasonally-flooded wetland. This impoundment was
  originally constructed as a containment area for dredged sediments which were
  contaminated through previous smelting operations. Extraction of elements from
  gizzard contents indicated that sentinel mallards experienced greater exposure
  to contaminants than their wild counterparts. Concentrations of the selected
  elements extracted from ingesta were lower than in seeds and sediments from the
  study site. Notable exceptions were barium and lead, which were not detected in
  seeds of some plant species, though they were present in the ingesta of one or
  more treatment groups. This technique may provide a more realistic means of
  estimating bioavailability and exposure than methods which measure total
  concentrations of elements in dietary components. The use of sentinel mallards
  may result in inflated estimates of risk to wild ducks using seasonally
  -available wetlands.

AB: Parasites are attracting increasing interest from parasite ecologists as
  potential indicators of environmental quality due to the variety of ways in
  which they respond to anthropogenic pollution. In environmental impact studies
  certain organisms provide valuable information about the chemical state of
  their environment not through their presence or absence but instead through
  their ability to concentrate environmental toxins within their tissues. Free
  living invertebrates, notably bivalve molluscs, are commonly employed in this
  role as `sentinel organisms' to monitor the concentrations of bioavailable
  metals in aquatic ecosystems. Also certain parasites, particularly intestinal
  acanthocephalans of fish, can accumulate heavy metals to concentrations orders
  of magnitude higher than those in the host tissues or the environment. The
  comparison of metal accumulation capacities between acanthocephalans and
  established free living sentinel organisms revealed significantly higher
  concentrations of several elements in Acanthocephalus lucii (Mueller) than in
  the Zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas) which is a commonly used
  bioindicating organism in Europe. In contrast to the high heavy metal
  concentrations recorded in adult acanthocephalans, the larval stages in their
  respective crustacean intermediate hosts show little tendency to accumulate
  metals. A number of experimental studies demonstrate a clear time dependent
  accumulation of lead for acanthocephalans in their final hosts. These
  investigations provide evidence that the extremely high metal concentrations in
  intestinal acanthocephalans of fish are not the result of a slow process of
  accumulation but instead a relatively rapid uptake to a steady-state level.
  Thus, metal concentrations in adult acanthocephalans respond rapidly to changes
  in environmental exposure of their hosts. The value of parasites for
  environmental monitoring will be discussed in detail in the present article.

AB: Fish-eating birds are particularly subject to accumulation of persistent
  organic pollutants, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been shown to
  constitute a major hazard for this group of birds. Grey heron (Ardea cinerea)
  hatchlings from two rookeries were applied as sentinel species to study PCB
  burdens in coastal ecosystems in mid Norway and north Norway, and plasma
  retinol and dioxin-equivalencies ( capital sigma TEQ) were applied to assess
  toxic effects of the PCB-burdens. The results show that grey herons appear to
  be amongst the fish-eating birds in Norway that are accumulating PCBs to the
  largest extent. There were no differences in capital sigma PCB or capital sigma
  TEQ in the yolk of grey heron hatchlings from the two rookeries and,
  accordingly, none in plasma retinol concentrations either. Furthermore, plasma
  retinol concentrations could not be related to capital sigma PCB or capital
  sigma TEQ. Thus, it seems that exposure levels are below the threshold for
  gross retinoid-related effects in grey heron hatchlings. There are also
  indications that the grey heron could be relatively insensitive to retinoid
  -related effects of PCBs. In the hatchlings with the highest pollutant levels,
  capital sigma TEQs were in the lower range of levels that have been associated
  with reduced hatching success in other fish-eating bird species.

AB: As part of the amended Metal Mining Liquid Effluent Regulations under the
  Fisheries Act, mines will be required to develop and conduct Environmental
  Effects Monitoring (EEM). EEM will be done to evaluate the effects of mine
  effluent on fish, fish habitat, and fish usability. Mines will be required to
  determine if there are changes in fish populations and or in the usability of
  fish due to mine effluent. The EEM program has been designed with a tiered
  monitoring approach, with the first phase determining if an effect is present.
  Subsequent phases of EEM program has been designed with a tiered monitoring
  approach, with the first phase determining if an effect is present. Subsequent
  phases of EEM will focus on continued monitoring and determining the magnitude,
  geographic extent, and cause of effects (if any). Fish collected from the area
  exposed to mine effluent will be compared to fish from a reference area in
  order to determine if there is an effect, if the effect is mine related and the
  cause of the effect within the effluent. The fish population survey will
  examine the growth, reproduction, condition, and survival of one or more
  resident sentinel fish species. Fish usability will be determined based on the
  appearance of fish, their use, and the contamination levels in fish tissue. It
  is recognized that some mines may not be able to implement a fish monitoring
  program as outlined, so it has been recommended that alternative methods, such
  as caged bivalves or on-site bioassays, may also be used. Frequency of
  monitoring will be dependent on the previous results of the fish and benthic
  invertebrate monitoring phases.

AB: 1. Sentinel behaviour involves a unique cooperative system of dedicated look
  -outs which protect members of their social group from attack by predators.
  Using detailed observations from groups of Arabian babblers, Turdoides
  squamiceps, we tested the original theoretical suggestion that cooperative
  sentinel systems are simply the result of individually selfish state-dependent
  patterns of behaviour. 2. Sentinel effort and the number of sentinel bouts per
  individual per hour were greater for males than females, and both increased
  with individual dominance status within the group. 3. Sentinel behaviour was
  unaffected by group social structure, in terms of patterns of relatedness and
  the number of potential breeders. 4. Total group sentinel effort increased with
  group size, while the effort per individual decreased irrespective of sex and
  dominance rank. Simultaneous sentinel behaviour by two or more birds was very
  rare, but increased with group size. 5. Sentinel effort followed seasonal
  fluctuations in food availability, but not peaks of raptor migration through
  the study site. 6. Body mass was greater for males than females and was
  positively related to dominance rank. Overall, body mass explained much of the
  variation in individual sentinel effort both within and between birds. However,
  data on individual foraging performance could not be related to changes in body
  mass and thus to differences in sentinel effort. 7. Sentinel behaviour in
  groups of Arabian babblers therefore confirms many of the predictions arising
  from state-dependent models of cooperative, yet individually selfish, sentinel
  behaviour.

AB: Environmental contamination resulting from the Chornobyl, Ukraine, disaster
  offers a unique opportunity to examine the in vivo biological effects of
  chronic, low-dose exposure to radiation. Laboratory studies of acute exposure
  to ionizing radiation have been used to estimate risk and potential human
  health effects by the extrapolation of laboratory data to situations of low
  -dose environmental radiation exposure. Few studies, however, have explored the
  biological consequences of low-dose exposure via in situ environmental
  radiation in a sentinel species. In the present study, laboratory strains of
  Mus musculus (BALB/c and 57BL/6) were placed in environmental enclosures in the
  Red Forest region of the Chornobyl exclusion zone. Blood samples were obtained
  every 10 d, and the micronucleus (MN) test was employed to assess the potential
  for cytogenetic damage from exposure to Chornobyl radiation. Radionuclide
  uptake was monitored throughout the study, and dose was estimated for each
  individual as well as for their offspring. Total dose for the mice
  experimentally exposed to this environment averaged 1162 mGy for BALB/c (30 d)
  and 1629 mGy for C57BL/6 (40 d). A higher MN frequency for both strains was
  observed at day 10, although this change was only statistically significant in
  the C57BL/6 mice ( chi super(2) sub(3) = 13.41, p = 0.003). Subsequent samples
  from C57BL/6 resulted in values at or less than the initial frequencies. In
  BALB/c mice, an increase in MN was also evident at day 30 ( chi super(2) sub(2)
  = 10.38, p = 0.006). The experimental design employed here allows for the
  incorporation of traditional laboratory strains, as well as transgenic strains
  of Mus, as sentinels of environmental radiation contamination.

AB: Cooperative sentinel behaviour in Arabian babblers, Turdoides squamiceps,
  appears generally consistent with state-dependent models of individually
  selfish antipredator behaviour. We examined further detailed aspects of this
  cooperative behaviour, including the suggestion that by engaging in this
  behaviour sentinels advertise their status and gain social prestige. Chosen
  sentinel locations were higher, but no more exposed, than the best alternative
  locations within 25 m. Sentinels started off closer to the centre of the
  foraging group than when sentinel bouts were terminated. Change-overs between
  sentinels were nearly always due to previous sentinels terminating their own
  bout. On the rare occasions when bouts were interrupted by upcoming sentinels,
  physical contact or aggression was extremely rare. Dominant males tended to
  terminate sentinel bouts of other birds, interrupting especially the dominant
  females. Other than this, there was no effect of an individual's sex or
  dominance rank on any aspect of sentinel change-overs or location choice when
  acting as a sentinel. There were also no differences in any sentinel activity
  between simple family groups, and those more complex nonfamily groups within
  which individuals compete for reproduction. Rates of alarm calling did not
  differ between group members, although dominant males did make more territorial
  calls to neighbouring groups while acting as a sentinel. Therefore, we found
  relatively little evidence that individuals compete for the chance to act as a
  sentinel as a means of showing off within groups of Arabian babblers. Instead,
  our study confirms the primary function of sentinels as a system of cooperative
  vigilance. Copyright 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB: Wastewater reuse raises the question of health risk and the epidemiological
  surveys needed. An epidemiological and environmental approach was used to check
  the security for the exposed populations (surrounding and agricultural
  population in Clermont-Ferrand. Four information systems were set up: two
  sentinel systems joining general physicians (15) and pharmacists (7) for the
  surrounding population and two follow-up surveys among field workers and
  farmers. Water quality monitoring and a study of aerosols from spray irrigation
  were performed. No epidemic event was identified with only some case clusters
  (not related to water exposure) being observed. All the declared cases were
  benign. The workers' survey underlined a substantial incidence of nettle
  rashes, itchy skins, sunburns, and cuts. The follow-up study among farmers and
  their families did not reveal any particular phenomena. The bacteriological
  quality of treated wastewater throughout conformed with the recommendations of
  the Superior Council of Public Health of France (1,000 faecal coliforms/100
  mL.). No faecal bacteria were observed in aerosols with water concentrations
  equal to 10 super(3) cfu/100mL and an exposure time of 20 min. The survey of
  such an irrigation system, towards potential and actual risks, required the
  conjunction of different epidemiological information sources and
  microbiological data.

AB: Several species of anuran amphibians have undergone drastic population
  declines in the western United States over the last 10 to 15 years. In
  California, the most severe declines are in the Sierra Mountains east of the
  Central Valley and downwind of the intensely agricultural San Joaquin Valley.
  In contrast, coastal and more northern populations across from the less
  agrarian Sacramento Valley are stable or declining less precipitously. In this
  article, we provide evidence that pesticides are instrumental in declines of
  these species. Using Hyla regilla as a sentinel species, we found that
  cholinesterase (ChE) activity in tadpoles was depressed in mountainous areas
  east of the Central Valley compared with sites along the coast or north of the
  Valley. Cholinesterase was also lower in areas where ranid population status
  was poor or moderate compared with areas with good ranid status. Up to 50% of
  the sampled population in areas with reduced ChE had detectable
  organophosphorus residues, with concentrations as high as 190 ppb wet weight.
  In addition, up to 86% of some populations had measurable endosulfan
  concentrations and 40% had detectable 4,4'-dichlorodiphenyl-dichloroethylene,
  4,4'-DDT, and 2,4'-DDT residues.

AB: The Department of Defense (DoD) has a unique marine mammal program
  maintained by the US Navy that includes the largest force of bottlenose
  dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, worldwide. In recent years, this population of
  cetaceans that lives in netted open water enclosures in San Diego Bay has been
  monitored for levels of organochlorine (OC) contaminants in blubber, blood and
  milk. Data generated from these studies have afforded insight into the fate and
  possible effects of OC contaminants in marine mammals. We now report
  preliminary findings on the effects of maternal OC exposure on pregnancy
  outcome. Blubber OC levels were compared between females whose calves survived
  beyond 6 months and females whose calves were stillborn or died within 12 days
  of birth. The mean concentration of capital sigma DDT was more than 3 times as
  high among dolphins whose calves died as that among dolphins whose calves
  survived beyond 6 months (P = 0.002). Mean capital sigma PCB was more than 2.5
  times higher in females whose calves did not survive (P = 0.076). This
  population is a logical sentinel for the assessment of environmentally mediated
  disease. Biological tissues and fluids can be sampled on a regular basis from
  the dolphins for accumulation of tissue residues, facilitated by conditioned
  husbandry behaviors. These trained behaviors help preclude possible alterations
  in health measures resulting from capture stress. Animals' diets can be
  monitored for contaminant levels. With these data, the expertise and facilities
  available at the Navy laboratory and in collaboration with other experts in the
  field, controlled studies can be designed to monitor and assess dietary
  exposure, measurable immune and neurologic responses and assess reproductive
  and transgenerational effects of contaminants. Biomarkers can be developed to
  relate the health of individual animals relative to contaminant exposures. Such
  investigations of natural exposure and response scenarios are a logical adjunct
  to traditional laboratory toxicity studies.

AB: Combustion of fossil fuels releases complex mixtures of gaseous and
  particulate contaminants into the environment. There is an ongoing debate over
  the health-related effects of exposure to airborne contaminants in urban
  environments. Some effects of exposure to high levels of air pollution can
  include: lung tissue damage inflammatory responses, impairment of pulmonary
  host defenses, acute changes in lung function and respiratory symptoms, chronic
  changes in respiratory epithelium, and significant cumulative lung burdens
  after chronic exposure that can disrupt lung function and produce long-term
  pathologic effects (reviewed in Folinsbee, 1992). In this study, we examine
  histopathologic changes in lung tissue of adult ring-billed gulls (Larus
  delawarensis), colonial-nesting sea birds of the Great Lakes. Gulls were
  examined from two colonies situated in cities with large integrated steel
  operations and from two rural locations, remote from cities and point sources
  of air pollutants. We have previously investigated colonies of herring gulls
  (Larus argentatus) inhabiting these four locations and showed that rates of
  germline minisatellite mutations (tandemly-repeated non-coding DNA sequences)
  were statistically significantly higher in colonies near steel mills compared
  to rural locations (Yauk and Quinn, 1996; Yauk et al., 2000). A significant
  negative correlation was found; mutation rates increased with decreasing
  distance between nests and steel mills (Yauk et al., 2000). We hypothesized
  that the increased mutation rates resulted from exposure to industrial
  chemicals through two possible routes: (a) ingestion of contaminated food and
  (b) inhalation of air contaminants. Hundreds of chemicals and high levels of
  air particulates are released into the environment through steel processing. In
  this study we use ring-billed gulls as a surrogate for herring gulls because
  they are much more abundant in the Great Lakes than the herring gull (nesting
  in the tens of thousands versus hundreds at typical herring gull colonies). It
  has been suggested that adult birds may be sensitive monitors of environmental
  contamination by gases and airborne particulates at low concentrations. The
  large amounts of oxygen required for flight coupled with a high metabolic rate
  suggest the potential application of birds as sentinel species for airborne
  chemical exposures (Brown et al., 1997).

AB: The North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG) is the largest ecosystem on our
  planet. However, this expansive habitat is also remote, poorly sampled, and
  therefore not well understood. For example, the most abundant oxygenic
  phototroph in the NPSG, Prochlorococcus, was described only a decade ago. Other
  novel Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya, recently identified by nucleic acid
  sequence analysis, have not been isolated. In October 1988, an ocean time
  -series research program was established to study ecosystem processes in the
  gyre, including rates and pathways of carbon and energy flow, spatial and
  temporal scales of variability, and coupling of ocean physics to biogeochemical
  processes. After a decade of ecosystem surveillance, this sentinel observatory
  has produced an unprecedented data set and some new views of an old ocean.
  Foremost is evidence for dramatic changes in microbial community structure and
  in mechanisms of nutrient cycling in response to large-scale ocean-atmosphere
  interactions. These and other observations demand reassessment of current views
  of physical-biogeochemical processes in this and other open-ocean ecosystems.

AB: Natural patterns of cooperative sentinel behaviour in Arabian babblers,
  Turdoides squamiceps, have proven consistent with state-dependent models of
  individually selfish anti-predator strategies. Here we demonstrate
  experimentally that sentinel effort within groups is determined simply by
  individual state. The two highest-ranking males in eight groups were separately
  fed a supplement of mealworms, each for one day at a time. Control days before
  and after each treatment confirmed that no carry-over effects occurred, and
  that most normal sentinel activity was carried out by alpha males, then beta
  males and then by the rest of the group. When supplemented, both alpha and beta
  males exhibited similar marked increases in sentinel activity, relative to
  control days. Unsupplemented males and the rest of the group incompletely
  compensated for these increases with reductions in sentinel effort. Differences
  in individual body mass within groups reflected natural and experimental
  variation in sentinel effort. Alpha and beta males weighed more than other
  group members, and gained mass only when supplementally fed. There was no
  evidence either for competitive sentinel behaviour, nor for any increased
  interference between males during the supplementation treatments. These results
  therefore provide strong evidence in support of the state-dependent approach to
  cooperative sentinel behaviour.

AB: In order to quickly assess potential environmental hazards of forwardly
  deployed military bases, we have focussed our efforts on biochemical and
  molecular changes in vertebrate cells following exposure to aqueous soil
  extracts. To this end, we are designing a series of deployable transgenic fish.
  Fish exhibit many of the same general defenses against toxic chemicals as do
  mammals, including enzyme induction, and the generation of oxidative stress. In
  response to many foreign compounds that generate oxidative stress, the
  transcription of certain protective genes is induced via specific DNA motifs
  called electrophile response elements (EPREs). We have made a plasmid construct
  containing a single murine EPRE fused to a minimal promoter and the cDNA
  encoding firefly luciferase (EPRE-LUC). In this paper, we have shown that the
  treatment of zebrafish cell line ZEM2S with a variety of chemicals known to
  induce EPRE-dependent transcription in cultured mammalian cells, results in
  dose-dependent induction of the transiently-transfected EPRE-LUC reporter
  construct. Compounds tested include aromatic hydrocarbons, heavy metals, and
  organophosphates. We observed similar dose-dependent responses when we treated
  ZEM2S and human cells in vitro with identical aqueous extracts of soil from
  hazardous waste sites. This suggests that the mechanism by which these
  compounds activate transcription is well conserved between mammals and
  zebrafish, and that transgenic zebrafish lines containing EPRE-driven reporter
  constructs might be useful as sentinels for the early detection of oxidative
  stress-inducing chemicals.

AB: The acute toxicity assay with premetamorphic tadpoles of Bufo arenarum as
  sentinel organism was applied to evaluate the quality of two water samples
  taken from three sites of the Reconquista River, an urban watercourse which is
  recipient of both untreated industrial effluents and domestic wastes. The
  results of the 96 hr bioassays were compared with the physicochemical
  parameters determined in the samples. Mortality rates in each sample were
  compared using the Bonferroni's test and a stepwise regression analysis of
  mortality and physicochemical parameters was done. In this way, it was possible
  to build up consistent descriptive models which showed that pH, Cl super(-), Cd
  super(2+) and Cu super(2+) concentrations in the river water were significant
  independent variables and might explain, under the experimental conditions, the
  recorded toxicity effects of the tested samples. Because of its simplicity, low
  cost and reliability it was suggested the tadpoles bioassay be included in the
  set of tests used in integrated program of freshwater pollution.

AB: Chronic, low-level exposure of health care professionals to waste anesthetic
  gases has been linked to increased incidences of neurologic and reproductive
  dysfunction, hepatic and renal toxicity, and neoplasia. The present study
  assessed the potential for waste anesthetic gas exposure to researchers
  administering isoflurane to rats by using standard delivery systems and
  conventional anesthesia protocols. Well-maintained bench-top precision
  isoflurane vaporizers were equipped with two circuits (a nonrebreathing one
  hooked to a modified Bain facemask, and the other to an induction box) attached
  to commercially available, activated charcoal canisters (passive gas
  scavenging). The isoflurane concentration was varied from 1% to 5%, while the
  oxygen flow rate was either 1 or 2.5 L/min. Real-time atmospheric isoflurane
  levels were assessed by using a portable infrared spectrophotometer. When
  euthanized female sentinel CD rats were positioned in the facemask loop,
  isoflurane emissions at the mask rat interface, breathing zone, and exhaust
  port of scavenging canisters were increased in proportion to the isoflurane
  concentration and oxygen flow rates as well as the amount of gas directed
  through the facemask circuit. Isoflurane was detected in the anesthetist s
  breathing zone only if the entire carrier gas flow was directed to the facemask
  loop. The background isoflurane level rose to 0.5 ppm after 75 min of
  continuous bench-top operation in a room with 22 air exchanges hourly but did
  not escalate if the anesthesia unit--or at least the gas-scavenging canister-
  -was placed in a fume hood, or if the system was used in a room with 42 hourly
  air changes. Isoflurane efflux via the exhaust ports exceeded 5 ppm in 31% of
  gas-scavenging canisters that had not reached their maximum use life (as
  defined by the manufacturer's specifications); in a parallel prospective study,
  isoflurane was emitted from 88% of canisters by the time that they had reached
  50% of their specified lifespan. These data indicate that (1) isoflurane
  emissions likely will occur at trace levels in laboratory animal facilities
  even when well-maintained precision isoflurane vaporizers equipped with
  conventional activated charcoal (passive) gas-scavenging units are used and (2)
  exposure to anesthetic pollution can be mitigated substantially by selecting
  low-flow anesthesia regimens, improving gas-scavenging practices, and
  optimizing the configurations of the delivery system and work area.

AB: BACKGROUND: Sentinel node radiolocalisation procedures are associated with
  low levels of radiation exposure. Radioactive material is present in the
  operating theatre and pathology laboratory. In most hospitals there are no
  official regulations in place for sentinel node radiation exposure. AIM: To
  establish guidelines on the safety of sentinel node mapping with emphasis on
  the management of radioisotopes. METHODS: The current literature regarding
  sentinel node procedures and radiation safety was reviewed. EU and US radiation
  safety regulations were scrutinised. RESULTS: Personnel involved in sentinel
  node procedures are exposed to low levels of radiation. These levels are not
  high enough to require designated radiation workers in the theatre and
  pathology laboratory. Awareness of radiation safety and certain precautions
  during the procedure and processing of the specimen can further reduce levels
  of exposure. CONCLUSION: Although low levels of radiation exposure are
  associated with sentinel node procedures, awareness of radiation safety and
  adherence to regulations, along with close interdepartmental co-operation, are
  recommended for further reduction in radiation exposure and safe application of
  this technique.

AB: Although the effects of heavy metals on marine invertebrate species are well
  studied in term of their toxicity and bioaccumulation, less is known about
  their genotoxicity. The aim of this investigation was to assess the DNA
  damaging potential of cadmium (Cd) in an important pollution sentinel organism,
  the mussel Mytilus edulis. Cadmium is one of the most toxic and widespread
  heavy metals found in the marine environment, and is a recognised carcinogen in
  mammals. Based on the results of the comet assay (alkaline single cell gel
  electrophoresis), Cd was found not to be genotoxic in mussel gill cells under
  acute and chronic exposure conditions, whereas pre-exposure to low
  concentrations of Cd was found to enhance the genotoxicity of another mutagen,
  hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The effects of H2O2 were normally reversible when
  cells were transferred to clean saline buffer. However, in cells that had been
  pre-treated with Cd, in vivo or in vitro, we observed a decrease in this post
  -treatment DNA repair. The effects of Cd were reversed by zinc which suggests
  that the inhibitory effect of Cd on DNA repair was due to the displacement of
  zinc ions from active sites on proteins involved in the repair process (a
  property already described for mammals). Moreover, since Cd inhibits or delays
  the onset of apoptosis (programmed cell death), this removes one of the main
  defence mechanisms responsible for protecting the organism against neoplasia.
  There appears to be a close similarity between the effects of Cd on marine
  molluscs and mammals.

AB: In this study the evidences governing the management of the axilla were
  examined and on the base of these evidences, the optimal clinical practice was
  outlined. Computerized searches for publications, debating specific treatment
  of axilla, were done of MEDLINE data. Level of evidence was determined using
  standard criteria: 1. metaanalysis of randomized trials, 2. randomized trial,
  3. prospective and retrospective studies, 4. reports and opinion of expert
  committees and working teams. The probability of lymph node involvement is
  related directly to the size of the primary tumour, and even with small tumour
  (up to 10 mm), the risk of nodal metastases is in the order of 10-20%. To date,
  the best strategy for determining complete lymph node status (qualitative and
  quantitative information) is through axillary dissection. For an accurate
  staging, at least ten nodes have to be obtained. Formal axillary sampling does
  not provide total quantitative data in patients with involved axilla. Sentinel
  node biopsy is a promising alternative to axillary dissection for staging but
  it is still under way. Axillary dissection should be omitted in patients with
  ductal carcinoma in situ since the probability of nodal involvement is less
  than 1%. In invasive breast cancer, the risk of axillary recurrence in the
  untreated axilla varies from about 10% to 40%. For women with stage I-II breast
  cancer at least level I and II axillary node dissection should be offered as
  the standard procedure to reduce the risk of regional recurrence. Women at high
  risk of axillary recurrence (> or = 4 involved nodes,

AB: The cellular processes involved in metal metabolism in molluscs are
  reviewed, with emphasis on the contribution of microscopy (AMG, ARG, EPMA, and
  SIMS) to both basic research of metal cell biology and applied environmental
  research. In molluscs, metal uptake may occur by facilitated diffusion, active
  transport, or endocytosis, and can be enhanced by MT synthesis or formation of
  mineralized granules. In aquatic molluscs, gills constitute a key interface for
  dissolved metal uptake, where metals are bound to MT, incorporated into
  lysosomes, and released basally towards the blood plasma and circulating
  hemocytes. However, particulate metal uptake is mainly achieved via the
  digestive tract by endocytosis; further metals are transferred first to
  lysosomes and then to residual bodies, especially in the digestive cells of the
  digestive gland. Additionally, metals can be accumulated selectively in
  specific cell types. As ligands pools differ from cell to cell, different
  metals may be retained in different cell types. Class "a" metals are localized
  in cells with granules composed of carbonate, oxalate, phosphate, and sulfate
  (oxygen donors), whereas "b" metals are associated with those cell types rich
  in sulfur and nitrogen ligands (sulfur donors). In molluscs, oxygen donors
  occur in connective tissue calcium cells and basophilic cells, whereas sulfur
  donors are present in digestive cells, podocytes, nephrocytes, and rhogocytes.
  Hemocytes, which constitute the most relevant system for metal transport
  between tissues, move around the body and may penetrate tissues and remove
  metals from the inner medium to be accumulated in lysosomes as nondigested
  products. Rhogocytes also participate in metal mobilization, accumulation, and
  release. The assessment of metal levels in target cells of sentinel molluscs by
  microscopic techniques provides an early-warning measure, with promising
  applications as an exposure biomarker for environmental monitoring programs.

AB: In June 1999, the dioxin crisis, caused by dioxin-contaminated feed
  components, exploded in Belgium, resulting in withdrawal of chicken and eggs
  from the market. Through the sentinel surveillance system, a decrease in
  Campylobacter infections during June 1999 was noticed. A model was generated
  with the reports from preceding years (1994 to 1998), and a prediction of the
  number of infections in 1999 was calculated. The model shows a significant
  decline (40%) in the number of infections, mainly because of the withdrawal of
  poultry. The use of a disaster as an epidemiologic tool offers a unique
  opportunity to observe exceptional changes in the occurrence of infections or
  other diseases.

AB: Environmental contamination resulting from the Chornobyl, Ukraine, disaster
  offers a unique opportunity to examine the in vivo biological effects of
  chronic, low-dose exposure to radiation. Laboratory studies of acute exposure
  to ionizing radiation have been used to estimate risk and potential human
  health effects by the extrapolation of laboratory data to situations of low
  -dose environmental radiation exposure. Few studies, however, have explored the
  biological consequences of low-dose exposure via in situ environmental
  radiation in a sentinel species. In the present study, laboratory strains of
  Mus musculus (BALB/c and 57BL/6) were placed in environmental enclosures in the
  Red Forest region of the Chornobyl exclusion zone. Blood samples were obtained
  every 10 d, and the micronucleus (MN) test was employed to assess the potential
  for cytogenetic damage from exposure to Chornobyl radiation. Radionuclide
  uptake was monitored throughout the study, and dose was estimated for each
  individual as well as for their offspring. Total dose for the mice
  experimentally exposed to this environment averaged 1,162 mGy for BALB/c (30 d)
  and 1,629 mGy for C57BL/6 (40 d). A higher MN frequency for both strains was
  observed at day 10, although this change was only statistically significant in
  the C57BL/6 mice (chi2/3 = 13.41, p = 0.003). Subsequent samples from C57BL/6
  resulted in values at or less than the initial frequencies. In BALB/c mice, an
  increase in MN was also evident at day 30 (chi2/3 = 10.38, p = 0.006). The
  experimental design employed here allows for the incorporation of traditional
  laboratory strains, as well as transgenic strains of Mus, as sentinels of
  environmental radiation contamination.

AB: After being diagnosed with a melanoma, an 18-year-old woman developed
  anaphylactic shock following an intracutaneous injection of patent blue during
  a sentinel lymph node biopsy procedure. Intracutaneous allergy tests revealed
  positive reactions with patent blue (Bleu patente V 'Guerbet') as well as with
  several anaesthetics and morphine. It was concluded that patent blue was the
  most probable causative agent for the anaphylactic reaction and that the
  possibility of such a reaction should be taken into consideration during
  sentinel node procedures. After a few days the operation was completed under
  epidural anaesthesia with technetium Tc 99m sulphur colloid being used to
  detect the sentinel node.

AB: Induction of heat shock proteins (Hsps) is often associated with a cellular
  response to a harmful stress or to adverse life conditions. The main aims of
  the present study were (1) to assess if stress-induced Hsp70 could be used to
  monitor exposure of the earthworm species Lumbricus terrestris to various soil
  pollutants, (2) to assess the specificity of pollutants in their tissue
  targeting and in Hsp70 induction, and (3) to evaluate if dose-response
  relationships could be established and if the stress-response observed was
  specific. The midgut/intestinal tissues of L. terrestris are shown to express
  an inducible member of the Hsp70 family after heat shock treatment in vitro and
  exposures to different soil toxicants in vivo (re: artificial soil). Short-term
  (24-72 hours) and long-term (14-16 days) exposures to the chemical standards
  chloroacetamide and pentachlorophenol and to heavy metals (Pb++, Cd++, Cu++,
  and Hg++) also affected the earthworms, and Hsp70 was induced in their
  midgut/intestinal tissues. After a 3-day exposure to heavy metals, the level of
  Hsp70 induction in the midgut/intestinal tissues appears to correlate well with
  the reported in vivo and in vitro toxicity data. Comparatively, in proximal and
  midbody wall muscle tissues of animals exposed to the heavy metals, a decrease
  in expression of Hsp70 was sometimes detected. Thus Hsp analysis by Western
  blot in L. terrestris tissues and particularly in the midgut/intestine proved
  to be a suitable and sensitive assay for adverse effects in earthworms and
  showed a good level of reproducibility despite some individual variations. The
  use of pristine/nonexposed animals transposed into contaminated environments as
  in the present study should therefore be of high ecological relevance.
  Induction of Hsp70 in earthworms should represent not only a good wide-spectrum
  biomarker of exposure but also a biomarker of effect since known toxicants
  altered gene expression in tissues of these animals, as contrasted with a
  simple accumulation of Hsp. Hence, the detection of Hsp70 in earthworms can
  constitute an early-warning marker for the presence of potentially deleterious
  agents in soils, with L. terrestris in particular and earthworms in general
  acting as potential sentinel animal species.

AB: Reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic analyses of bile of a
  territorial benthic fish, oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau), indicated that fish
  from reference stations in the York and Elizabeth Rivers, Virginia, contained
  lower concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) metabolites than
  fish from polluted stations. PAH metabolite levels in the bile of fish from
  mildly polluted stations were 7 to 10 times greater than those from reference
  stations. PAH metabolite levels in fish from a moderately polluted station and
  a highly polluted station were, respectively, 20 and 50 times greater than
  those from reference stations. Differential patterns of five major PAH
  metabolites in fish from the same station suggested individual variability in
  metabolic pathways possibly further convoluted by the differential inductions
  or suppressions of hepatic mixed-function oxygenase isozyme systems under
  various natural or anthropogenic habitat parameters. PAH metabolite levels in
  the bile of oyster toadfish correlated well with the gradient of PAH
  contamination in the Elizabeth River sediments. High levels of biliary PAH
  metabolites were not detected in muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus) collected along
  the polluted sections of the Elizabeth River, probably due to their primarily
  herbivorous nature. Assuming that the hepatobiliary system and the
  gastrointestinal tract are the major routes of biotransformation and excretion
  of PAHs in the muskrats, the contaminated diet appears to be a more important
  routes of exposure of muskrats (and possibly oyster toadfish) to PAHs than the
  transdermal transfer. Occurrence permitting, we propose oyster toadfish as a
  useful biological sentinel for early detection of estuarine PAH pollution.

AB: An objective of the Workers' Health Program at the Pan American Health
  Organization (PAHO) is to strengthen surveillance in workers' health in the
  Region of the Americas in order to implement prevention and control strategies.
  To date, four phases of projects have been organized to develop multinational
  workplace health and hazard surveillance in the Region. Phase 1 was a workshop
  held in 1999 in Washington, D.C., for the purpose of developing a methodology
  for identifying and prioritizing the top three occupational sentinel health
  events to be incorporated into the surveillance systems in the Region. Three
  surveillance protocols were developed, one each for fatal occupational
  injuries, pesticide poisoning, and low back pain, which were identified in the
  workshop as the most important occupational health problems. Phase 2 comprised
  projects to disseminate the findings and recommendations of the Washington
  Workshop, including publications, pilot projects, software development,
  electronic communication, and meetings. Phase 3 was a sub-regional meeting in
  2000 in Rosario, Argentina, to follow up on the progress in carrying out the
  recommendations of the Washington workshop and to create a Virtual Regional
  Center for Latin America that could coordinate the efforts of member countries.
  Currently phase 4 includes a number of projects to achieve the objectives of
  this Center, such as pilot projects, capacity building, editing a compact disk,
  analyzing legal systems and intervention strategies, software training, and
  developing an internet course on surveillance. By documenting the joint efforts
  made to initiate and develop Regional multinational surveillance of
  occupational injuries and diseases in the Americas, this paper aims to provide
  experience and guidance for others wishing to initiate and develop regional
  multinational surveillance for other diseases or in other regions.

AB: Abstract.In connection with the implementation of the study "Sentinel Health
  Departments" which was performed in 1992 in Baden-Wurttemberg by the
  Landesgesundheitsamt (LGA) the importance of Analytical Quality Protection
  (AQP) in the environmental medicine was emphasized. In 1994 the LGA established
  a quality circle in Baden-Wurttemberg (BW) in the area of the human
  biomonitoring. In 1998 the area of responsibilitiy was expanding and the
  quality circle was occupied with the "Biological Indoor Pollution" and the
  "Chemical Indoor Pollution" as well. In 2000 a group of members of the
  Sozialministerium BW, the Landesarztekammer BW and the four Kassenarztliche
  Vereinigungen of Baden-Wurttemberg was set up at the LGA. In 2001 the working
  group "Landerarbeitsgruppe umweltbezogener Gesundheitsschutz" (LAUG) intends to
  establish a project team which is called "Certification in the realm of the
  Human Biomonitoring". The coordination will be effected by the LGA. Until now
  the work of the qualitiy circle led to an improvement of the comparability of
  the results of the different laboratories and to a more realistic assessment of
  the uncertainty of the results referring to the environmental medical
  examinations.

AB: BACKGROUND: Isosulfan blue 1% is a dye used in medical procedures such as
  lymphangiography and sentinel lymph node biopsy. Anaphylactic reactions to this
  dye have been rarely reported. OBJECTIVE: We are reporting two patients who
  experienced anaphylaxis after subcutaneous administration of isosulfan blue.
  METHODS: Two female patients with breast cancer were evaluated by our allergy
  service after suspected intraoperative anaphylactic episodes during sentinel
  lymph node biopsies in which they had received isosulfan blue 1% for the
  purpose of visualization of the lymph vessels. In the first case, the patient
  suffered hypotension and hypoxia requiring intubation. In the second case, the
  patient suffered prolonged hypotension. Both patients recovered without
  sequelae. The patients were seen in our clinic, and skin tests were performed
  to isosulfan blue in addition to other agents the patients had received during
  anesthesia. RESULTS: In both cases, the patients demonstrated positive skin
  tests to isosulfan blue. Neither patient had positive skin tests to any other
  agent used for skin testing. Isosulfan blue skin tests were performed in nine
  control subjects and all skin tests in the control subjects were negative.
  CONCLUSIONS: Isosulfan blue may be a cause of anaphylactic reactions and this
  seems to be an immunoglobulin E-mediated event as confirmed by positive skin
  tests.

AB: BACKGROUND: Chlamydia trachomatis has been recognized as a major sexually
  transmitted infection in North America and Western Europe during the past two
  decades. The incidence of C trachomatis in Finland has been continuously high
  throughout the 1990s. OBJECTIVES: As the epidemic of C trachomatis infection
  continues in Finland, there is a need to obtain up-to-date information on the
  prevalence and patient profiles in the planning of preventive strategies.
  METHODS: A nationwide sentinel clinic network consisting of seven sexually
  transmitted disease (STD) and five general student health clinics was
  established in 1995. Data were collected during a 3-year period (1995-1997)
  from 3,686 patients with and 32,230 patients without C trachomatis using a self
  -administered questionnaire. RESULTS: The prevalence of chlamydia was 8.4% in
  the STD clinics and 5.3% in the general clinics; 90% of the infections were
  endemic. The prevalence was highest in the youngest age group (15-19 years; 16%
  in females, 14% in males). The patients with chlamydia were significantly
  younger (mean age: men 26.6 years, women 23.7 years) than those without
  chlamydia. Women with chlamydia used oral contraceptives or intrauterine
  devices (IUD) significantly more often (59%) than women without chlamydia
  (42%). A high number of sex partners and a history of previous chlamydia during
  the preceding 12 months were also risk factors. Men contracted chlamydia
  frequently from a casual partner (61%) but rarely from a commercial sex worker
  (2%). For women, the source partner was most often a regular one (61%). The
  median time from exposure to attendance was 34 days, and was highest when the
  source partner was a spouse. One third of the patients could have spread
  chlamydia to a new partner before the diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: C trachomatis
  infection is spread all over Finland, and the risk factors include younger age,
  high number of sex partners, and use of oral contraceptives or IUDs. Source
  partner analysis focused attention on the importance of transmission from
  regular partners, especially in women. The time from transmission to diagnosis
  was long, and any effort to shorten this period would be an effective
  preventive strategy.

AB: In April 1998, an ecological disaster resulting from a massive toxic spill
  of mining acid waste rich in heavy metals posed a serious threat to the Donana
  National Park in southwestern Spain. This especially important protected area
  is the nesting and breeding site for many endangered bird species; white storks
  (Ciconia ciconia) and black kites (Milvus migrans) are considered the more
  representative. The suitability of the Comet assay as a biomarker for genotoxic
  analysis in environmental biomonitoring has been recently validated in studies
  using different sentinel organisms such as fish, amphibians, rodents, or
  mollusks. Birds preying on a variety of invertebrate and vertebrate species in
  the marshlands are appropriate for evaluating the potential deleterious effects
  of the toxic spill on wildlife of the Dofiana area. Our study on wetland birds
  high on the aquatic trophic chain sampled within a few months after the toxic
  spill in the area around Donana National Park has shown the accumulation of
  heavy metals. Fourteen months after the mine waste spill, blood samples from
  white storks and kites collected in the neighborhood of the park and from
  control birds at reference areas for comparison were examined by fluorescence
  image analysis after lymphocyte isolation, and by subsequent alkaline single
  -cell gel (SCG) electrophoresis, known as the Comet assay. Our results indicate
  that the exposed birds had a significantly increased level of genotoxic damage
  compared with control animals from noncontaminated locations.

AB: In order to use a sentinel organism to monitor hazardous trace metals in
  themarine environment, a reliable analytical procedure for the determination
  oftrace metal concentrations in biological samples is necessary. A critical
  step of the trace metal determination is a sample digestion to solubilize
  metals. In order to develop a simple method of sample digestion using a
  commercially available laboratory microwave equipment, a acid combination (HNO
  sub(3)and H sub(2)SO sub(4)) and microwave power-time program were examined
  with respect to recovery of reference materials. Using 1 g of reference
  material with5 mL of nitric acid and 1 mL of sulfuric acid, Mn, Cd, Cu, Ni, Se,
  As, Sr and Zn were properly analyzed yielding the certified values within the
  analytical uncertainties, but Pb yielded a slightly higher values. The
  detection limit was 0.1, 0.1, 0.5, 0.5, 1, 0.7, 1, 0.2 and 1 ppm for Mn, Cd,
  Cu, Ni, Se, As, Zn, Sr and Pb. This method was successfully applied to natural
  oysters and blue mussels collected from Tokyo Bay and Aburatsubo Bay.

AB: Birgus latro, the world's largest land crustacean, was studied in the field
  on the isle of south sentinel (Andaman Islands) which so far is the
  northernmost Birgus locality in the Indian Ocean. All crabs but one showed an
  intense blue body colouration in contrast to the yellowish-red hues reported
  from the other Birgus localities between the Seychelles and the Pacific area.
  These was no specific diurnal or nocturnal activity pattern in Birgus on this
  uninhabited island. Locomotion, climbing, feeding, fighting and digging, were
  covered by cinematography. The lifting force of Birgus exceeds 28kg, and in
  clinging to a tree the crab musters more than 30 kg of gripping force. In the
  claws, force is combined with refined manipulation ability, handling coconut
  husk fibres and plastic threads and ropes easily. Birgus did not react to
  acoustic or vibrational stimuli, and orientation in the field relies mainly on
  olfactory and visual clues. The tacto-olfactory organs on the ventral side of
  the antennula are presented in scanning electron microscope photographs. It is
  strongly suggested that the unique Birgus locality of South Sentinel should be
  placed under protection.

AB: The garden snail (Helix aspersa) is currently used as bioindicator of
  metallic pollution. Our objective was to extend its use to organic chemicals by
  studying the effects and tissue concentrations of the organophosphorus
  pesticide dimethoate following dietary uptake. After exposure for four weeks to
  increasing doses of pesticide in the diet, the median lethal concentration
  (LC50) was determined to be 3,700 mu g/g food. Clinical signs indicated a no
  -observed-effect concentration of 100 mu g/g and a lowest-observed-effect
  concentration of 250 mu g/g. The growth parameters were decreased with
  increasing exposure to the pesticide. The median effective concentration
  (EC50), which was evaluated based on both shell diameter and dry weight
  inhibitions, was 665 and 424 mu g/g, respectively, and the EC10 was 180 and 145
  mu g/g, respectively. Accumulation in the viscera was related to the amount of
  dimethoate in the food. The bioconcentration factors were low (>6 x 10 super(
  -3)). Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was strongly decreased (80% from 250
  mu g/g). In conclusion, we demonstrated that the species H. aspersa could be a
  useful sentinel organism for organophosphorus contamination surveys. Among the
  effects measured, the inhibition of AChE activities and clinical signs were the
  most sensitive, followed by the growth parameters. These results confirm the
  suitability of the garden snail for development of sublethal toxicity tests
  using primary consumers and aboveground organisms.

AB: Previous studies have demonstrated no difference in micronucleus (MN)
  frequencies between wild rodents chronically exposed to the environmental
  radiation contamination of the Chornobyl (Ukraine) exclusion zone and those
  inhabiting reference populations. The aim of the present study was to test the
  hypothesis that a population of bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) has
  developed radioresistance as a result of 14 years of chronic, low-dose
  radiation exposure. Naive voles were placed in environmental enclosures in the
  Red Forest region of the exclusion zone for 30 d. Blood samples were obtained
  at regular intervals, and the MN assay was used to assess chromosomal damage.
  Additionally, radionuclide uptake was monitored throughout the study, and dose
  was documented for each individual as well as for their offspring. Total dose
  for the voles experimentally exposed in this environment averaged 1.09 Gy
  (36.20 mGy d super(-1)) for the 30-d study period. Our results indicate that
  exposure to radiation levels well above regulatory statutes did not result in
  an increased MN frequency. Furthermore, our results do not support the
  hypothesis that voles chronically exposed to these radiation levels have
  developed a genetic basis for radioresistance that is unique from that present
  in naive populations. The use of C. glareolus as a sentinel species for
  environmental studies of radiation contamination and the question of whether
  the MN assay is an appropriate endpoint for studies of low-dose, chronic
  radiation exposure are also discussed.

AB: The presence of environmental contaminants in air, water and food may pose
  significant health risks to the exposed human population. However, problems
  associated with assessing chronic exposure to low doses of environmental
  chemicals, multiple exposure routes, diseases with long latency periods, and
  non-specific health outcomes make it difficult to conduct the appropriate human
  epidemiologic studies. It may be useful to complement human epidemiology with
  animal studies. Animals monitored or evaluated in situ for the appropriate
  suite of endpoints can provide information about both exposure levels and
  potential adverse health effects. Animals have served as sentinel indicators
  for health effects associated with a number of environmental exposures,
  including pesticides and asbestos. Pet dogs may be particularly valuable
  sentinels because they share the human environment. In addition, dogs respond
  to many toxic insults in ways analogous to humans, they have physiologically
  compressed life spans, and they are free from some important lifestyle risk
  factors for disease. An example of how pet dogs may be used as sentinels for
  potential human health hazards involves a study of the genotoxic effects
  resulting from exposure to a mixture of chemicals from nearby Superfund sites.
  We conducted a cross-sectional study of exposed dogs (living in the community
  with the Superfund sites) and controls (living in a nearby community). The pet
  owners completed a questionnaire, and we collected a blood sample from each
  dog. The blood samples were analyzed for standard clinical parameters and
  assays for possible genotoxic effects (peripheral blood lymphocyte micronucleus
  frequency and lymphocyte subtyping). Pet dogs living near the Superfund sites
  had a higher micronucleus frequency than control animals, suggesting that the
  dogs may have been exposed to environmental contaminants from these sites.

AB: Eel Anguilla anguilla plasma vitellogenin was investigated as a biomarker of
  exposure to environmental compounds with estrogenic activity, along the tidal
  course of the Thames Estuary. Eels were chosen as a sentinel species because of
  their wide distribution, robustness in field and laboratory studies and also
  because they have a characterised normal intersex condition where the gonad
  contains both developing male and female gonadal cells termed a Syrski organ.
  Following laboratory exposure to 17 beta -estradiol, a plasma protein
  (approximately 211kD apparent molecular weight) was detected by monoclonal
  antibodies to vitellogenin of striped bass (Morone saxatilis). Western and dot
  blot analyses were developed and the vitellogenin was isolated from 17 beta 
  -estradiol-treated fish to calibrate the quantification of the blots by image
  analysis. The limits of sensitivity for the Western and dot blots were 100 and
  10 ng vitellogenin/ml respectively. Values of eel plasma vitellogenin were
  determined in fish sampled along the Tyne, Wear, Tees or Humber estuaries, or
  the Weston canal Liverpool, with mean plasm vitellogenin levels varying between
  44-82 ng/ml. These levels of vitellogenin in A. anguilla plasma were observed
  to be consistent with both the known biology of the eel and vitellogenin levels
  determined in other laboratory studies using eels. Immature females, or fish
  with Syrski organs, reported both lower levels and smaller variation of plasma
  vitellogenin concentration whereas the highest plasma vitellogenin
  concentrations were determined in fish above 45 cm consistent with female fish.
  These results identify inter-species variation between the plasma vitellogenin
  concentrations of eel and other published fish studies e.g. flounder collected
  along the River Thames and other UK estuaries. Clearly eel can induce
  vitellogenin following 17 beta -estradiol exposure, therefore, the mechanistic
  processes of vitellogenin induction should be explored to characterise the
  inter-species variability.

AB: A Shallow-water Environmental Profiler in Trawl-safe, Real-time
  configuration (SEPTR) has been developed by SACLANT Undersea Research Centre in
  support of oceanographic modeling and rapid environment assessment programs. It
  is being deployed operationally for the first time during September 2000 as
  part of real-time multi-scale oceanographic modeling experiments in the
  Ligurian Sea. The SEPTR system combines the best capabilities of the Barny
  Sentinel ADCP bottom platform and the SWEEP water column profiler developments
  at SACLANT Centre. It is intended for 3-6 month deployments in areas where
  water column instruments are at risk from fishing trawlers, but with real-time
  data return and control via two-way cellular or satellite communication. SEPTR
  includes a micro-controller based bottom platform which houses an Acoustic
  Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), wave/tide gage, ambient noise sensor array,
  and water column profiler buoy system. The profiler buoy system has an
  independent micro-controller with its own sensor suite. Communications and
  battery recharge from the bottom platform are supplied through the 2 mm
  diameter cable. The profiler requests winch operations from the bottom
  electronics for autonomous vertical profiling of CTD and optical properties of
  the water column in depths down to 100m. Cable and profiler drag permit
  profiling with currents up to 2 knots at 50m depth and 1 knot at 100m depth.
  The profiler buoy includes DGPS navigation capability along with two-way
  communication capability while on the surface. It also includes acceleration
  and magnetic field sensors capable of surface wave buoy measurements. The
  bottom platform includes an extended duration battery package in the
  recoverable barnacle-shaped housing. Recovery of the entire system is
  accomplished through either radio or acoustic communication with the profiler
  in order to release a messenger buoy. If the platform becomes inverted due to
  trawling, the system without ballast can still be recovered by acoustic command
  to a backup acoustic release/transponder system within the bottom platform. The
  system is designed for 360 profiles during a 3-6 month deployment in up to 100m
  water depth, with current, wave/tide and noise measurements every hour. Two way
  communication of data, position and control allows profile results to be
  returned in real time, and operational commands, profile schedules, and DGPS
  correctors to be sent to multiple profiler instruments. Project status and
  future plans will be presented.

AB: Dose response experiments were conducted to determine a range of sub-lethal
  concentrations of the carbamate insecticide carbaryl to L3 larvae of the brown
  lacewing (Micromus tasmaniae). The LC50 value was determined to be 0.07% active
  ingredient (700 ppm) at 48 hours. Pesticide exposure experiments were conducted
  using sublethal doses determined from LC50 calculations to assess the effect of
  carbaryl on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and glutathione S-transferase (GST)
  activities at 2 and 24 h (forAChE) and 10 hours (for GST) after the onset of
  exposure. GST activity was not significantly affected by exposure to carbaryl,
  but AChE activity was significantly depressed (P < 0.001) within two hours of
  exposure, even at low concentrations of carbaryl.Acetylcholinesterase activity
  remained depressed 24 hours after exposure, indicating that this enzyme may be
  a useful biomarker of short-term insecticide exposure, if the brown lacewing is
  further developed as a sentinel species for demonstrating the presence of
  bioavailable organophosphorus pesticide contamination. Further experiments are
  needed to determine the length of time required for AChE activity to return to
  pre-exposure levels before this enzyme could be used as a biomarker of chronic
  exposure.

AB: We investigated some entomological factors underlying altitudinal prevalence
  variation in the Venezuelan Amazonia human onchocerciasis focus. Spatial and
  temporal variation in relative abundance, daily biting rate, proportion of
  parous flies, and monthly parous biting rate were studied for the three main
  simuliid vectors (based on their vectorial competence: Simulium oyapockense
  s.l. Floch & Abonnenc approximately S. incrustatum Lutz << S. guianense s.l.
  Wise). Yanomami villages were selected among sentinel communities of the
  ivermectin control program, representing hypoto hyperendemicity conditions of
  infection. Spatial variation was explored via increasing village altitude on
  two river systems (A: Ocamo-Putaco and B: Orinoco-Orinoquito). Temporal
  variation was studied between 1995 and 1999 by sampling the biting population
  during dry and rainy months. Environmental variables included monthly rainfall
  and maximum river height. Simuliid species composition itself varied along the
  altitudinal and prevalence gradient. S. oyapockense s.l. prevailed below 150 m.
  Above this altitude and up to 240 m, S. incrustatum and S. guianense s.l.
  became more frequently and evenly collected along A but not along B, where S.
  incrustatum remained absent. The daily biting rate of S. oyapockense s.l. was
  higher during the dry season along A, whereas the converse took place along B.
  Daily biting rate of S. incrustatum was lowest during early rains. By contrast,
  the daily biting rate of S. guianense s.l. was highest during this period.
  There was a significant negative cross-correlation between proportion of parous
  of S. oyapockense s.l. and river height (2 and 3 mo lagged), whereas this
  variable (1 and 2 mo lagged) was positively correlated with the proportion of
  parous flies for S. incrustatum. Monthly parous biting rate values suggest that
  the months contributing most to onchocerciasis transmission in the area are
  likely to be the dry season and the transition periods between seasons.

AB: Exposure to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), an important cofactor in the etiology of
  hepatocellular carcinoma in Taiwan, is influenced by dietary and other factors.
  The present study examined the intraindividual variability in AFB1-albumin
  adducts, the most reliable long-term biomarker of AFB1 exposure, and whether
  the baseline or follow-up adduct levels and the intraindividual variability in
  adduct levels are modified by endogenous and environmental factors. The study
  measured AFB1-albumin adduct levels among 264 healthy male residents of three
  townships (Hu-Hsi, Ma-Kung, and Pai-Hsa) of Penghu Islets, Taiwan, at two
  different time points with a median interval of 1.68 years (range 1.00-3.17
  years). There was a generalized reduction in the adduct levels, with the median
  values being 22.1 pmol/mg (range 5.0-355.8 pmol/mg) at time 1 and 14.3 pmol/mg
  (range 5.0-205.2 pmol/mg) at time 2. This intraindividual variability in adduct
  levels was inversely associated with the age of subjects and the time interval
  between the two blood draws. The variability in adduct levels was lower among
  subjects in Hu-Hsi and Pai-Hsa townships as compared to those in Ma-Kung. No
  significant association was observed for the intraindividual variability in
  AFB1-albumin adducts with regard to the season when blood was drawn. There was
  also no significant association between intraindividual variability and
  hepatitis B surface antigen, anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV), glutathione S
  -transferase (GST) M1, or GSTT1 status. In conclusion, we found substantial
  intraindividual variability in the AFB1 exposure (as determined by AFB1-albumin
  adducts) in Taiwan, which was probably more likely related to dietary or other
  environmental influences rather than to endogenous factors (e.g., hepatitis B/C
  viral infection or GST M1/T1 genetic status).

AB: One of the most important advances in the surgical treatment of early-stage
  breast cancer has been the introduction of sentinel lymph node dissection as an
  alternative to routine axillary node dissection. This minimally invasive
  procedure may reduce the morbidity of surgical treatment and improve staging of
  the axillary lymph node basin. Over the last 5 to 7 years, numerous
  institutions have published their sentinel node identification rates, false
  -negative events, optimal techniques, and learning curves. Many of these issues
  need confirmation in a prospective multicentered fashion and other issues such
  as survival and comparative toxicities require prospective randomized trials.
  Two prospective randomized trials using sentinel node biopsy have been
  implemented in the United States: the NSABP B-32 trial and the ACOSOG
  Z0010/Z0011 trials. Design, hypotheses, and rationale for these trials are
  discussed.

AB: There is no existing formal, long-term program for gathering evidence of the
  incidence and severity of the health effects of toxic substances in wildlife.
  However, research-based studies of bald eagles, herring gulls, night herons,
  tree swallows, snapping turtles, mink, and beluga over the past 30 years have
  revealed a broad spectrum of health effects in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence
  basin including thyroid and other endocrine disorders, metabolic diseases,
  altered immune function, reproductive impairment, developmental toxicity,
  genotoxicity, and cancer. These effects occurred most often and were most
  severe in the most contaminated sites (Green Bay, Saginaw Bay, Lake Ontario,
  the St. Lawrence estuary, and more recently, Lake Erie), some of which are
  International Joint Commission-designated Areas of Concern (AOCs). In all
  cases, a strong argument can be made for an environmental etiology, and in many
  cases for the involvement of persistent organic pollutants, particularly
  polychlorinated biphenyls, polychlorinated dibenzo-(italic)p(/italic)-dioxins,
  and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. For some, the association with particular
  contaminants is consistent with controlled studies, and in some, dose-response
  relationships were documented. The biologic significance of these health
  impairments to the affected species is currently unclear, but they resemble
  those observed with increased incidence in human subpopulations in one or more
  AOCs. Formalizing health effects monitoring of sentinel wildlife species by the
  parties to the Canada-USA Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement is required. This
  would facilitate the optimal use of sentinel wildlife health data in a larger,
  epidemiologic weight-of-evidence context upon which to base decisions and
  policies regarding the effects of chemical exposures on human populations.

AB: We used a simulated gizzard environment to examine the bioavailability of
  barium, cadmium, copper, lead and zinc to wild and sentinel mallards (Anas
  platyrhynchos) using a seasonally-flooded wetland. This impoundment was
  originally constructed as a containment area for dredged sediments which were
  contaminated through previous smelting operations. Extraction of elements from
  gizzard contents indicated that sentinel mallards experienced greater exposure
  to contaminants than their wild counterparts. Concentrations of the selected
  elements extracted from ingesta were lower than in seeds and sediments from the
  study site. Notable exceptions were barium and lead, which were not detected in
  seeds of some plant species, though they were present in the ingesta of one or
  more treatment groups. This technique may provide a more realistic means of
  estimating bioavailability and exposure than methods which measure total
  concentrations of elements in dietary components. The use of sentinel mallards
  may result in inflated estimates of risk to wild ducks using seasonally
  -available wetlands.

AB: A sentinel phenotype is a clinical disorder or syndrome that (1) occurs
  sporadically as a consequence of a single, highly penetrant mutant gene, (2) is
  a dominant or X-linked trait of considerable frequency and low fitness, and (3)
  is uniformly expressed and accurately diagnosable with minimal effort at or
  near birth. Although 1828 autosomal dominant traits are known in human beings,
  36 can be considered as candidate sentinel phenotypes, along with 5 X-linked
  disorders. Based on surveys of malformations in infants and children, 16
  additional traits are proposed beyond previous lists. In Hungary, the 24
  syndromes or defects with reliable manifestations in newborn infants occur with
  a frequency of 2.5-3.3 per 10 000 live births. As markers of human mutations,
  sentinel phenotypes have the advantage of representing germinal mutations that
  result in significant health problems. There are severe disadvantages that
  have, to date, prevented the launching of a field demonstration of the value of
  these phenotypes in mutation epidemiology. Agreement on a list of phenotypes
  has been delayed by continued recognition of two or more distinct genetic
  diseases within what was once thought to be a single disorder. For the same
  reason, most of the candidate sentinel phenotypes have not been assigned unique
  codes in the International Classification of Diseases. Each of the disorders is
  so rare and has features that overlap with so many other syndromes that highly
  trained clinical dysmorphologist and pediatric ophthalmologists would have to
  be engaged in any study. The sentinel phenotype approach, like other strategies
  in mutation epidemiology, would encounter problems with linkage among files of
  data, privacy, and access to sufficiently large populations. In contrast with
  the approach using multiple protein variants (as in the study of blood from
  offspring of survivors of the atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki), the
  sentinel phenotype approach would likely be much less expensive and would
  encounter far fewer false attributions of paternity, but also would require a
  much larger study population. The best option for the present, in our opinion,
  is to broaden and sustain critical discussion of the approach. Perhaps the goal
  should be to plan a field demonstration by involving appropriate clinicians,
  epidemiologists, and public health officials. A pilot effort underway in
  Hungary may well give insight to applying the approach in a significantly
  larger population.

  Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre. A fifth were associated with the
  consumption of poultry. Chicken was implicated in almost three quarters of
  these outbreaks, turkey in over a fifth and duck in 2% of outbreaks. The
  organisms most frequently reported were Salmonella (30% of outbreaks),
  Clostridium perfringens (21%) and Campylobacter (6%). Over 7000 people were
  affected, with 258 hospital admissions and 17 deaths. During the summer,
  outbreaks were mainly of salmonellosis and attributed to the consumption of
  chicken. In December, C. perfringens and turkey were the organism and vehicle
  most often implicated. Most outbreaks occurred on commercial catering premises
  (56%) or in private houses (21%). The highlight of this surveillance period was
  the fall in outbreaks of salmonellosis linked with poultry products, probably
  due, at least in part, to the vaccination of poultry flocks.

AB: BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is an alternative to axillary
  dissection for many breast cancer patients. Cases of anaphylactic reaction to
  the isosulfan blue dye used during SLNB have recently been reported. No study
  on the incidence of serious anaphylactic reactions during SLNB for breast
  cancer has been reported. METHODS: We reviewed 639 consecutive SLNBs for breast
  cancer performed at our institution. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed
  using both isosulfan blue dye and technetium-99m sulfur colloid. Cases of
  anaphylaxis were reviewed in detail. RESULTS: Overall, 1.1% of patients had
  severe anaphylactic reactions to isosulfan blue requiring vigorous
  resuscitation. No deaths or permanent disability occurred. In patients with
  anaphylaxis, hospital stay was prolonged by a mean of 1.6 days. In 1 patient,
  the anaphylactic reaction required termination of the operation. CONCLUSIONS:
  Prompt recognition and aggressive treatment of anaphylactic reactions to
  isosulfan blue are critical to prevent an adverse outcome. Lymphatic mapping
  with blue dye should be performed in a setting where personnel are trained to
  recognize and treat anaphylaxis.

AB: The garden snail (Helix aspersa) is currently used as bioindicator of
  metallic pollution. Our objective was to extend its use to organic chemicals by
  studying the effects and tissue concentrations of the organophosphorus
  pesticide dimethoate following dietary uptake. After exposure for four weeks to
  increasing doses of pesticide in the diet, the median lethal concentration
  (LC50) was determined to be 3,700 microg/g food. Clinical signs indicated a no
  -observed-effect concentration of 100 microg/g and a lowest-observed-effect
  concentration of 250 microg/g. The growth parameters were decreased with
  increasing exposure to the pesticide. The median effective concentration
  (EC50), which was evaluated based on both shell diameter and dry weight
  inhibitions, was 665 and 424 microg/g, respectively, and the EC10 was 180 and
  145 microg/g, respectively. Accumulation in the viscera was related to the
  amount of dimethoate in the food. The bioconcentration factors were low (>6 x
  10(-3)). Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was strongly decreased (80% from
  250 microg/g). In conclusion, we demonstrated that the species H. aspersa could
  be a useful sentinel organism for organophosphorus contamination surveys. Among
  the effects measured, the inhibition of AChE activities and clinical signs were
  the most sensitive, followed by the growth parameters. These results confirm
  the suitability of the garden snail for development of sublethal toxicity tests
  using primary consumers and aboveground organisms.

AB: Previous studies have demonstrated no difference in micronucleus (MN)
  frequencies between wild rodents chronically exposed to the environmental
  radiation contamination of the Chornobyl (Ukraine) exclusion zone and those
  inhabiting reference populations. The aim of the present study was to test the
  hypothesis that a population of bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) has
  developed radioresistance as a result of 14 years of chronic, low-dose
  radiation exposure. Naive voles were placed in environmental enclosures in the
  Red Forest region of the exclusion zone for 30 d. Blood samples were obtained
  at regular intervals, and the MN assay was used to assess chromosomal damage.
  Additionally, radionuclide uptake was monitored throughout the study, and dose
  was documented for each individual as well as for their offspring. Total dose
  for the voles experimentally exposed in this environment averaged 1.09 Gy
  (36.20 mGy d(-1)) for the 30-d study period. Our results indicate that exposure
  to radiation levels well above regulatory statutes did not result in an
  increased MN frequency. Furthermore, our results do not support the hypothesis
  that voles chronically exposed to these radiation levels have developed a
  genetic basis for radioresistance that is unique from that present in naive
  populations. The use of C. glareolus as a sentinel species for environmental
  studies of radiation contamination and the question of whether the MN assay is
  an appropriate endpoint for studies of low-dose, chronic radiation exposure are
  also discussed.

AB: Eel Anguilla anguilla plasma vitellogenin was investigated as a biomarker of
  exposure to environmental compounds with estrogenic activity, along the tidal
  course of the Thames Estuary, UK. A. anguilla was chosen as a sentinel species
  because of their wide distribution, robustness in field and laboratory studies
  and also because they have a characterised normal intersex' condition where the
  gonad contains both developing male and female gonadal cells termed a Syrski
  organ. Following laboratory exposure to 17beta-estradiol (intraperitoneal
  injection), a plasma protein (approx. 211 kDa apparent molecular weight) was
  detected by monoclonal antibodies to vitellogenin of striped bass (Morone
  saxatilis). Western and dot blot analyses were developed and vitellogenin was
  isolated from 17beta-estradiol-treated fish to calibrate the quantification of
  the blots by image analysis. The limits of sensitivity for the Western and dot
  blots were 100 and 10 ng vitellogenin/ml, respectively. Levels of vitellogenin
  in Thames estuary samples were below the detection limits of the Western but
  not the dot blot, and showed no statistically significant site-specific (10
  sites) and seasonal-specific (May, August, November) differences. Values were
  observed to be low, between 11 and 165 ng/ml, compared with 17-50 mg/ml for
  17beta-estradiol-treated eels. Similar low levels of plasma vitellogenin were
  determined in fish sampled along the Tyne, Wear, Tees or Humber estuaries, or
  the Weston canal Liverpool, with mean plasma vitellogenin levels varying
  between 44 and 82 ng/ml. These levels of vitellogenin in A. anguilla plasma
  were observed to be consistent with the known biology of the eel. Immature
  females, or fish with syrski organs, reported both lower levels and smaller
  variation of plasma vitellogenin concentrations whereas the highest plasma
  vitellogenin concentrations were determined in fish above 45 cm consistent with
  female fish. These results indicate inter-species variation between the plasma
  vitellogenin concentrations of A. anguilla and other published fish studies
  undertaken along the same estuaries.

AB: BACKGROUND: Among the advocates of blue dye, isotope, or combined dye
  -isotope mapping of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) for breast cancer, there is
  no universal consensus as to which technique is optimal and whether the
  relative value of each method changes with increasing experience. The objective
  of this study was to examine the relative contributions of blue dye and
  radioisotope to successful identification of the SLN as the SLN-mapping
  technique evolved over our first 2,000 consecutive cases. STUDY DESIGN: Using
  the first 2,000 consecutive SLN biopsy procedures for breast cancer, performed
  by eight surgeons (none previously experienced in SLN techniques) at one
  institution, using a combined technique of blue dye and isotope mapping, we
  report the institutional learning curve and the relative contributions of dye
  and isotope to identifying both the SLN and the positive SLN, by increments of
  500 cases. RESULTS: Comparing the first 500 with the most recent 500 cases,
  success in identifying the SLN by blue dye did not improve with experience,
  although success in isotope localization steadily increased, from 86% to 94% (p

AB: The rat has been used extensively as a health sentinel, indicator, or
  monitor of environmental health hazards, but this model has not been directly
  validated against human exposures. Humans in Mexico City show upper respiratory
  tract lesions and evidence of pulmonary damage related to their environmental
  inhalation exposure. In this study, male and female F344 rats were exposed (23
  hr/day) in Mexico City to local Mexico City air (MCA)* for up to seven weeks.
  Controls were maintained at the same location under filtered air. Prior to
  these exposures, several steps were taken. First, the nasal passages of normal
  male rats shipped from the United States and housed in Mexico City were
  examined for mycoplasma infection; no evidence of infection was found. In
  addition, a mobile exposure and monitoring system was assembled and, with an
  ozone (O3) exposure atmosphere, was tested along with supporting histopathology
  techniques and analysis of rat nasal and lung tissues. Last, the entire
  exposure model (equipment and animals) was transported to Mexico City and
  validated for a three-week period. During the seven-week study there were 18
  one-hour intervals during which the average O3 concentration of MCA in the
  exposure chamber exceeded the US National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS)
  of 0.120 ppm 03 (hourly average, not to be exceeded more than once per year).
  This prolonged exposure of healthy F344 rats to MCA containing episodically low
  to moderate concentrations of 03 (as well as other urban air pollutants) did
  not induce inflammatory or epithelial lesions in the nasal airways or lung as
  measured by qualitative histologic techniques or quantitative morphometric
  techniques. These findings agree with those of previous controlled O3
  inhalation studies, but they are in contrast to reports indicating that O3
  -polluted MCA causes significant nasal mucosal injury in adults and children
  living in southwestern Mexico City. Taken together, these findings may suggest
  that human airways are markedly more susceptible to the toxic effects of MCA
  than are the airways of the F344 rat.

AB: Wastewater reuse raises the question of health risk and the epidemiological
  surveys needed. An epidemiological and environmental approach was used to check
  the security for the exposed populations (surrounding and agricultural
  population in Clermont-Ferrand. Four information systems were set up: two
  sentinel systems joining general physicians (15) and pharmacists (7) for the
  surrounding population and two follow-up surveys among field workers and
  farmers. Water quality monitoring and a study of aerosols from spray irrigation
  were performed. No epidemic event was identified with only some case clusters
  (not related to water exposure) being observed. All the declared cases were
  benign. The workers' survey underlined a substantial incidence of nettle
  rashes, itchy skins, sunburns, and cuts. The follow-up study among farmers and
  their families did not reveal any particular phenomena. The bacteriological
  quality of treated wastewater throughout conformed with the recommendations of
  the Superior Council of Public Health of France (1,000 faecal coliforms/100
  mL). No faecal bacteria were observed in aerosols with water concentrations
  equal to 10(3) cfu/100 mL and an exposure time of 20 min. The survey of such an
  irrigation system, towards potential and actual risks, required the conjunction
  of different epidemiological information sources and microbiological data.

AB: Fish-eating birds are particularly subject to accumulation of persistent
  organic pollutants, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been shown to
  constitute a major hazard for this group of birds. Grey heron (Ardea cinerea)
  hatchlings from two rookeries were applied as sentinel species to study PCB
  burdens in coastal ecosystems in mid Norway and north Norway, and plasma
  retinol and dioxin-equivalencies (sigmaTEQ) were applied to assess toxic
  effects of the PCB-burdens. The results show that grey herons appear to be
  amongst the fish-eating birds in Norway that are accumulating PCBs to the
  largest extent. There were no differences in sigmaPCB or sigmaTEQ in the yolk
  of grey heron hatchlings from the two rookeries and, accordingly, none in
  plasma retinol concentrations either. Furthermore, plasma retinol
  concentrations could not be related to sigmaPCB or sigmaTEQ. Thus, it seems
  that exposure levels are below the threshold for gross retinoid-related effects
  in grey heron hatchlings. There are also indications that the grey heron could
  be relatively insensitive to retinoid-related effects of PCBs. In the
  hatchlings with the highest pollutant levels, sigmaTEQs were in the lower range
  of levels that have been associated with reduced hatching success in other fish
  -eating bird species.

AB: BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C is transmitted by transfusion of unscreened blood,
  through injecting drugs, from mother-to-child and, on occasion, sexually.
  Transmission generally requires that the infector is hepatitis C virus (HCV)
  RNA positive, a 'carrier'. About three-quarters of injectors who are hepatitis
  C antibody positive are HCV-RNA positive and so infectious to others.
  Incubation periods from HCV infection to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma
  are even longer than from HIV infection to AIDS, being counted in decades; they
  depend on age, gender, alcohol consumption and co-infection with other viruses.
  We identify 25 data sources that are available, or required, for projecting the
  severe sequelae of the injection-related hepatitis C epidemic. DATA SOURCES:
  Three data sources relate to hepatitis C diagnosis: register of confirmed HCV
  infections (with initial of first name + soundex of surname + date of birth +
  gender = master index, exposure category, year of starting to inject, and
  region); surveys of HCV test-uptake by injectors and others; documentation of
  pregnancy and its outcome in HCV-infected women (injectors and others). Four
  data sources relate to HCV prevalence and incidence among injectors and others:
  anonymous testing for HCV antibodies in blood or saliva (for sentinel groups
  ranging from new blood donors, pregnant women, patients awaiting kidney
  transplantation, non-injector prisoners, health-care workers, non-injector
  heterosexuals attending genitourinary medicine clinics; to injectors in the
  community, at drug treatment centres or in prison); historical data on HCV
  prevalence in injectors; HCV incidence studies in injectors; and uptake of harm
  reduction measures--frequency of sharing and methadone substitution--by
  injectors. Key reporting problems in HCV incidence studies, which inhibit
  checks on the convenient exponential assumption for time from start of
  injecting to hepatitis C infection, are discussed. Nine critical data sources
  are identified for monitoring the late sequelae of hepatitis C carriage, its
  investigation and treatment: linkage surveillance, for example by master index,
  to identify deaths, hospitalisations or cancer registrations among confirmed
  HCV infections; surveys of HCV status among patients who undergo liver biopsy,
  are newly diagnosed with cirrhosis or are newly diagnosed with liver cancer;
  surveys of liver-biopsy rate in HCV-infected injectors and others; uptake and
  outcome of interferon + ribavirin in the treatment of hepatitis C carriers;
  cohort studies of HCV progression; sample surveys of genotype in HCV-infected
  injectors, and others; acute hepatitis B infections and uptake of hepatitis B
  immunisation by injectors; liver transplantation in HCV-infected patients; and
  hepatitis C-status and other risk factors in deaths from cirrhosis or liver
  cancer, to determine whether they are HCV and injector-related. Finally, nine
  critical data sources are identified for quantitative understanding of the
  underlying injector epidemic: drug misuse databases plus capture-recapture
  methods to assess number of injectors, drug-related deaths by region to assess
  injector numbers; number of HIV-infected injectors; HIV progression in
  injectors; overdose and other causes of death in injectors; expert opinion on
  injector incidence historically, plus survey information on age-distribution at
  initiation and duration of injector careers; injector incidence historically
  inferred from hepatitis C infected blood donors; age-distribution of current
  injectors and at initiation, as a check on the assumptions made in stochastic
  simulation about injector incidence and 'outcidence' from injecting
  historically; mortality of former injectors; and general population or other
  survey ratios of surviving ever-injectors to injectors in the last 5 years,
  last year and currently, as a check on simulations. RECOMMENDATIONS: We
  recommend a common HCV diagnosis report form to improve ascertainment of risk
  -factor information, especially year of starting to inject--which is a key date
  epidemiologically. We also recommend updated surveys of current and former
  injectors' HCV-test uptake, or a denominator study that registers master index
  and risk factor information for all HCV testees. We recommend that injector
  surveys ask about typical frequency of needle sharing per 4 weeks in three
  distinct periods this year, last year and in the first year of injecting. We
  also recommend the location of stored historical samples from injectors to be
  tested retrospectively and anonymously for HCV antibodies. We recommend
  immediate attention to the uptake of, and response to, combination treatment by
  hepatitis C carriers who are former or recovering injectors. We rec

AB: The vascular macrophyte Typha latifolia Linnaeus (common cattail) may be a
  sentinel for evaluating potential phytotoxicity to rooted aquatic macrophytes
  in aquatic systems. To further evaluate the potential utility of this species,
  T. latifolia seed germination, shoot growth, and root elongation were measured
  in 7-day aqueous exposures using mean measured aqueous copper concentrations of
  10.0, 23, 41, 62, 174, and 402 microg Cu/L, which were > or = 62% of nominal
  concentrations. Seed germination and seedling shoot growth were not
  significantly affected by any of these copper concentrations as compared to
  controls. Mean measured no-observed-effect-concentration (NOEC) and lowest
  -observed-effect-concentration (LOEC) for root elongation were 18.6 microg Cu/L
  and 35.0 microg Cu/L, respectively. Seven-day sediment tests were conducted by
  amending uncontaminated sediments with copper sulfate to mean measured
  concentrations of 7.9, 17.1, 21.0, 51.2, 89.5, and 173.5 mg Cu/kg, which were >
  or = 84% of nominal concentrations. Seed germination was not significantly
  different from controls. Mean measured NOEC and LOEC values for seedling shoot
  growth were 89.5 mg Cu/kg and 173.5 mg Cu/kg, respectively, and mean measured
  NOEC and LOEC values for root growth were 14.0 mg Cu/kg and 19.7 mg Cu/kg,
  respectively. These results demonstrate that T. latifolia early seedling growth
  can be utilized for assessing aqueous and sediment toxicity of copper.

AB: This paper describes the prevalence of, and risk factors for, exposure to
  syphilis in a random sample of male and female prisoners. We found that only 2%
  of male and 1% of female prison inmates in New South Wales (NSW) had confirmed
  evidence of untreated syphilis, and none appeared to be in an infectious phase.
  In the multivariate analysis, indigenous ethnicity remained the most potent
  predictor for confirmed syphilis (either past or present). There was some
  evidence to suggest that syphilis among indigenous prisoners may be associated
  with limited access to health services outside prison. The epidemiology of
  syphilis reflects that of the general community suggesting that prisons could
  be used as sentinel sites to help evaluate the effectiveness of STD prevention
  and control strategies.

AB: Background: This surveillance study was undertaken to target efforts to
  prevent work-related carpal tunnel syndrome (WR-CTS) and to assess physician
  case-reports as a source of surveillance data. Methods: Physician case-reports
  and workers' compensation disability claims were used to document patterns of
  WR-CTS in Massachusetts from March 1992 to June 1997 by age, gender, industry,
  occupation, and calendar year. Characteristics of cases identified through the
  two data sources were compared. Results: 4,836 cases of WR-CTS were
  ascertained; 6% were identified by both data sources. Whereas the two sets of
  cases were similar with respect to age and occupation categories, physician
  -reported cases were more likely male and employed in manufacturing. The number
  of compensation claims filed by women declined over time, and a substantial
  number of cases under age 25 years were identified. Manufacturing workers had
  the highest rates; the highest numbers of cases were employed in hospitals,
  grocery stores, and the insurance industry. Several technical/administrative
  support occupations likely to use video display terminals had both high rates
  and frequencies. Conclusion: WR-CTS is a significant public health problem.
  Physician reports are useful in understanding problem magnitude and targeting
  specific establishments for intervention but are currently of limited use in
  targeting specific industries and occupations.

AB: To investigate the incidence of and variables associated with clinically
  evident fat necrosis in women treated on a protocol of high-dose-rate (HDR)
  brachytherapy alone without external-beam whole-breast irradiation for early
  -stage breast carcinoma. From 6/1997 until 8/1999, 30 women diagnosed with
  Stage I or II breast carcinoma underwent surgical excision and postoperative
  irradiation via HDR brachytherapy implant as part of a multi-institutional
  clinical Phase I/II protocol. Patients eligible included those with T1, T2, N0,
  N1 ( less than or equal to 3 nodes positive), MO tumors of nonlobular histology
  with negative surgical margins, no extracapsular lymph-node extension, and a
  negative postexcision mammogram. Brachytherapy catheters were placed at the
  initial excision, re-excision, or at the time of axillary sampling. Direct
  visualization, surgical clips, ultrasound, or CT scans assisted in delineating
  the target volume defined as the excision cavity plus 2-cm margin. High
  activity super(192)Ir (3-10 Ci) was used to deliver 340 cGy per fraction, 2
  fractions per day, for 5 consecutive days to a total dose of 34 Gy to the
  target volume. Source position and dwell times were calculated using standard
  volume optimization techniques. Dosimetric analyses were performed with three
  -dimensional postimplant dose and volume reconstructions. The median follow-up
  of all patients was 24 months (range, 12-36 months). Eight patients (crude
  incidence of 27%) developed clinically evident fat necrosis postimplant in the
  treated breast. Fat necrosis was determined by clinical presentation including
  pain and swelling in the treated volume, computed tomography, and/or biopsy.
  All symptomatic patients (7 of 8 cases) were successfully treated with 3 to 12
  months of conservative management. Continuous variables that were found to be
  associated significantly with fat necrosis included the number of source dwell
  positions (p = 0.04), and the volume of tissue which received fractional doses
  of 340 cGy, 510 cGy, and 680 cGy (p = 0.03, p = 0.01, and p = 0.01,
  respectively). Other continuous variables including patient age, total excised
  tissue volume, tumor size, number of catheters, number of days the catheters
  were in place, planar separation, dose homogeneity index (DHI), and uniformity
  index (UI) were not significant. Discrete variables including the
  presence/absence of DCIS, sentinel versus full axillary nodal assessment,
  receptor status, presence/absence of diabetes, and the use of chemotherapy or
  hormone therapy were not found to have a significant association with the risk
  of fat necrosis. In this study of HDR brachytherapy of the breast tumor
  excision cavity plus margin, treatment was planned and delivered in accordance
  with the dosimetric parameters of the protocol resulting in a high degree of
  target volume dose homogeneity. Nonetheless, at a median follow-up of 24
  months, a high rate of clinically definable fat necrosis occurred. The overall
  implant volume as reflected in the number of source dwell positions and the
  volume of breast tissue receiving fractional doses of 340, 510, and 680 cGy
  were significantly associated with fat necrosis. Future dosimetric optimization
  algorithms for HDR breast brachytherapy will need to include these factors to
  minimize the risk of fat necrosis.

AB: Monocrotophos is the single largest selling agrochemical in India. Sensitive
  biomarkers to study the genotoxic effects caused by monocrotophos in aquatic
  organisms, especially fish, are lacking. The fish used in this study are
  Tilapia mossambica, which are edible, commercially valuable and distributed all
  over India. The objective of this study was to study DNA strand breaks induced
  by monocrotophos in T. mossambica in vivo using single-cell micro gel
  electrophoresis/comet assay. Tilapia were treated orally with 0.313, 0.625,
  1.25, 1.875, 2.5, 3.125, 3.75 and 4.375 ppm of monocrotophos and the assay was
  performed on nucleated erythrocytes after 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. A significant
  increase in mean comet tail-length (5.21-7.46 mu M), indicating DNA damage, was
  observed at all the doses with monocrotophos when compared to controls (3.36 mu
  M). The mean tail-length showed a dose-related increase and time-dependent
  decrease. The maximum increase in mean comet tail-length was observed at 24 h.
  Relative to these effects, reductions in mean comet tail-length were seen at 48
  and 72 h. By 96 h, values had returned to control levels at all doses,
  indicating repair of the damaged DNA and/or loss of heavily damaged cells. The
  study reveals that the comet assay is a sensitive and rapid method to detect
  genotoxicity of monocrotophos and other environmental pollutants in sentinel
  species.

AB: Sentinels are group members that watch from prominent positions. Sentinel
  interchanges often appear orderly and the number of sentinels changes little
  despite the turnover of individuals. I modeled why solitary individuals or
  group members might take up prominent positions. Such positions can be safe
  places to rest because they provide a good view of approaching predators, even
  if undetected predators preferentially attack sentinels. In pairs, coordinated
  sentinel behavior is favored whenever information spreads from a detecting to a
  non-detecting individual more than half the time. Under these conditions,
  safety for a sentinel produces safety for a forager as a by-product. Thus
  sentinel behavior occurs for selfish safety reasons but coordination of
  sentinels is based on mutualism. If sentinels can coordinate their individual
  actions, evidence of the game is hidden from view. The fitness consequences of
  some games may be best indicated by the strategies organisms take to avoid
  playing them.

AB: Sentinel species are biological monitors that accumulate a pollutant in
  their tissues without significant adverse effects. Primarily used to measure
  the amount of a pollutant that is biologically available, they may also
  increase the sensitivity of an analytical procedure or summarise a complex
  pollution signal. This paper examines the validation of sentinels, referring
  particularly to the use of invertebrates in monitoring toxic metal pollution in
  terrestrial ecosystems. Few studies measure the capacity of a sentinel to
  quantify changes in ambient levels. Definitions of `bioavailability' also
  differ between workers and few note that this may be a highly species-specific
  measure. Validation requires that the temporal and spatial scales over which a
  sentinel integrates a pollution signal are known. The sentinel has to be
  calibrated against source concentrations and this relationship shown to be
  consistent over the normal range of exposure. This requires some consideration
  of the environmental and biological determinants of pollutant assimilation.
  Differences between populations can confound simple comparisons between sites
  based on native populations. Transplanted individuals, matched for age, sex and
  physiological state, might be used when the aim is not to assess
  bioavailability to the resident population. A simple measure of their capacity
  to detect differences in ambient pollutant levels is proposed to evaluate
  candidate species, to assess their consistency and capacity to equilibrate with
  their source. A small survey of earthworms from a well-defined gradient of Pb
  pollution is used to illustrate problems of interpreting tissue concentrations
  in sentinels.

AB: Declining trends in male proportion at birth observed in several Western
  countries might reflect widespread exposure to pollutants capable of
  interfering with human reproduction. In this study, the authors describe male
  live birth proportion trends in 23 European countries from 1950 to 1996 (total
  of 305 million live births). Overall, there was a significant linearly
  decreasing trend of 10 fewer males per 100,000 births each year, resulting in a
  loss of 73,462 boys during a 47-yr period. The proportion of male births during
  the first 3 yr of the study period was higher than in the last 3 yr in 18
  countries (i.e., 78%). Decreasing trends, which varied in slope and shape, were
  observed in 11 countries; no significant trend was found in 8 countries, and
  male birth proportion increased in 4 countries. The results of this study
  confirmed that the proportion of male births is declining in Europe, and
  differences exist by region and country. Social and cultural aggregations of
  countries with decreasing trends suggest that sociodemographic characteristics
  might be more likely to explain trends than environmental exposures to
  chemicals. Investigators should evaluate this hypothesis to assess the
  usefulness of male birth proportion as a sentinel event.

AB: BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) dissection in the management of high
  -risk melanoma and other cancers, such as breast cancer, has recently increased
  in use. The procedure identifies an SLN by intradermal or intraparenchymal
  injection of an isosulfan blue dye, a radiocolloid, or both around the primary
  malignancy. METHODS: At the time of selective SLN mapping, 3 to 5 mL of
  isosulfan blue was injected either intradermally or intraparenchymally around
  the primary malignancy. From October 1997 to May 2000, 267 patients underwent
  intraoperative lymphatic mapping with the use of both isosulfan 1% blue dye and
  radiocolloid injection. Five cases with adverse reactions to isosulfan blue
  were reviewed. RESULTS: We report 2 cases of anaphylaxis and 3 cases of "blue
  hives" after injection with isosulfan blue of 267 patients who had
  intraoperative lymphatic mapping by the procedure described above. The 2
  patients with anaphylaxis experienced cardiovascular collapse, erythema,
  perioral edema, urticaria, and uvular edema. The blue hives in 3 patients
  resolved and transformed to blue patches during the course of the procedures.
  CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of allergic reactions in our series was 2.0%. As
  physicians expand the role of SLN mapping, they should consider the use of
  histamine blockers as prophylaxis and have emergency treatment readily
  available to treat the life- threatening complication of anaphylactic reaction.

AB: OBJECTIVES: To convene a multidisciplinary panel of dermatologists, surgical
  oncologists, and medical oncologists to formally review available data on the
  sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy procedure and high-dose adjuvant interferon
  alfa-2b therapy for patients with melanoma and to rate the "appropriateness,"
  "inappropriateness," or "uncertainty" of the procedure and therapy to guide
  clinical decision making in practice. PARTICIPANTS: The panel comprised 13
  specialists (4 dermatologists, 4 oncologists, and 5 surgeons) from
  geographically diverse areas who practiced in community-based settings (n = 8)
  and academic institutions (n = 5). Participants were chosen based on
  recommendations from the relevant specialty organizations. EVIDENCE: A formal
  literature review was conducted by investigators at Protocare Sciences Inc,
  Santa Monica, Calif, on the risks and benefits of performing an SLN biopsy in
  patients with stage I or II melanoma and adjuvant interferon alfa-2b therapy in
  patients with stage II or III disease. The MEDLINE database was searched from
  1966 through July 2000, and supplemental information was obtained from various
  cancer societies and cancer research groups. Panel participants were queried on
  additional sources of relevant information. Unpublished, presented data were
  included in abstract form on 1 recently closed clinical trial. CONSENSUS
  PROCESS: The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method was used to review and rate
  multiple clinical scenarios for the use of SLN biopsy and interferon alfa-2b
  therapy. The consensus method did not force agreement. CONCLUSIONS: The panel
  rated 104 clinical scenarios and concluded that the SLN biopsy procedure was
  appropriate for primary melanomas deeper than 1.0 mm and for tumors 1 mm or
  less when histologic ulceration was present and/or classified as Clark level 4
  or higher. The SLN biopsy was deemed inappropriate for nonulcerated Clark level
  2 or 3 melanomas 0.75 mm or less in depth and uncertain in tumors 0.76 to 1.0
  mm deep unless they were ulcerated or Clark level 4 or higher. Interferon alfa
  -2b therapy was deemed appropriate for patients with regional nodal and/or in
  -transit metastasis and for node-negative patients with primary melanomas
  deeper than 4 mm. The panel considered the use of interferon alfa-2b therapy
  uncertain in patients with ulcerated intermediate primary tumors (2.01-4.0 mm
  in depth) and inappropriate for node-negative patients with nonulcerated tumors
  less than 4.0 mm deep. Specialty-specific ratings were conducted as well.

AB: OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Because sentinel lymph nodes are the first lymph
  nodes that drain a primary cancer site, results of sentinel lymph node (SLN)
  biopsy indicate status of the regional lymph nodes. Preoperative
  lymphoscintigraphy and intraoperative combined application of the handheld
  gamma probe and blue-dye technique (i.e., the "combined technique") was used
  previously to accurately identify the SLN, mostly in melanoma of the
  extremities and trunk and, sometimes, in melanoma of the head or neck, which is
  anatomically complex. Because of this complexity, melanoma in the head or neck
  is inherently problematic to treat: Localization of the SLN can be difficult or
  impossible because the primary cancer site can be near or overlapping the nodal
  basin. The objective of the present study was to determine the technical
  modifications and other considerations that can make SLN localization feasible
  in cases of melanoma occurring near or overlapping the nodal basin in the head
  or neck. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: In a retrospective study of clinical records
  containing our database of melanoma diagnoses made between January 1996 and
  December 1999, we identified 27 patients diagnosed with stage I or II primary
  melanoma of the head or neck with clinically negative neck nodes who also had
  had preoperative lymphoscintigraphy. Of the 27 patients (17 male and 10 female
  patients; mean age, 54 y), 24 had SLN biopsy by intraoperative localization
  using both the handheld gamma probe and the blue-dye technique. RESULTS: Among
  the 27 patients who had SLN mapping, a median Breslow thickness of 1.8 mm was
  noted. Sentinel lymph node was noted at preoperative lymphoscintigraphy in 26
  (96%) of the 27 patients. Activity of technetium Tc 99m (Tc-99m) sulfur colloid
  injected ranged from 10 to 1000 microCi (0.37 to 37 megabecquerel [MBq]).
  Intraoperative use of the combined technique for sentinel lymphadenectomy was
  successful in 92% of patients. Sentinel lymph nodes were identified in all 14
  patients who received Tc-99m sulfur colloid at an activity level less than 60
  microCi (2.2 MBq); mean activity level of injected TC-99m sulfur colloid was 28
  microCi (1.04 MBq). Sentinel lymph nodes were identified in 8 (80%) of 10
  patients who received Tc-99m sulfur colloid at an activity level greater than
  100 microCi (3.7 MBq); mean activity of injected Tc-99m sulfur colloid in these
  patients was 482 microCi (17.8 MBq). A mean number of 1.4 sentinel lymph nodes
  per patient was identified at preoperative lymphoscintigraphy, and a mean
  number of 3 sentinel lymph nodes per patient was identified intraoperatively
  using the combined technique. Tumor recurrence was seen in 2 (10%) of the 19
  patients who had cancer-free SLN at mean follow-up of 18 months (range, 1 to 47
  mo). Sentinel lymphadenectomy of the parotid region did not injure the facial
  nerve in any patients. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with primary melanoma that is
  near or overlaps the nodal basin in the head or neck, SLN biopsy can be
  accurately performed using Tc-99m sulfur colloid at low activity levels (10
  microCi to 60 microCi [0.37 to 2.2 MBq]. However, background radiation from the
  primary injection site can incorporate the SLN, making localization at
  preoperative lymphoscintigraphy difficult if not impossible; therefore, the
  high doses commonly used for melanoma of the extremities and trunk (500 to 2000
  microCi [18.5 to 74 MBq]) should not be used for melanoma of the head or neck
  if the primary site is near or overlaps the nodal basin. In addition,
  absorption of Tc-99m sulfur colloid by salivary glands increases background
  radiation in the nodal basin; therefore, use of the handheld gamma probe for
  intraoperative localization of SLN can be problematic in regions where lymph
  nodes are adjacent to or within the substance of the salivary gland (i.e., the
  submandibular and parotid glands).

AB: Nowadays in the western countries, the Work Musculoscheletal Disorders
  (WMSDs) are the most relevant work-related diseases either for the large number
  of at-risk workers and for the high prevalence of cases among them. Among
  WMSDs, the Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is considered a sentinel event in
  occupational medicine and epidemiological surveillance systems were set up to
  study its temporal occurrence and spatial spread. Surprisingly enough, in our
  country the epidemiology of the WMSDs is still unknown; although observations
  of important clusters of cases are increasing, these pathologies are still
  largely underreported by medical doctors. In the high industrialised province
  of Brescia, Northwestern Italy, only 1% of the 25.000 occupational disease,
  collected by the occupational medicine and prevention service of the National
  Health Service (SPSAL) since 1989 to 1997, were coded as WMSDs. Even if the
  notification of these work-related disorders is compulsory by low since 1973,
  up-to-now very few cases were reported to SPSALs, and consequently active
  prevention programs were very few too. For that reason, a project of active
  surveillance of WMSDs diagnosed on the general population was carried out to
  improve their identification and to evaluate the work-related etiological
  fraction as well as to address primary prevention projects. During 1997-1999
  618 upper limb musculoskeletal disorders were collected from 2 orthopaedic
  hospital divisions where cases underwent surgical treatment. 369 of them were
  interviewed by telephone (253 female, 116 man) and 128 cases (34%) were
  classified as probable professionally exposed to some known hazard. Female were
  prevalent (71%), involved particularly in textile, garments, plastic, food
  production and domestic services. Among men, construction, metallurgic and
  mechanic were the more frequent jobs. 116 WMSDs were reported to the National
  Insurance Institute (INAIL). The collection of these WMSDs was the basis for
  specific communications to the firm manager(s) and to the factory's medical
  doctor(s) with the aim to make it easy: i) a good health surveillance to
  exposed workers; ii) a specific risk assessment; iii) carrying out prevention
  programs and adopting personal protection equipments. Some problems are focused
  concerning the underreporting of cases, the anamnesis information, the fate of
  interventions to face the problem in the workplaces. A possible implementation
  of this project is also discussed to avoid a WMSds surveillance unlinked
  prevention programs of occupational risks.

AB: OBJECTIVE: Dyspepsia usually presents first in primary care. There are many
  reasons for referral including urgent problems (for example, haematemesis and
  melaena), treatment failure, or to exclude serious pathology. Referral will
  change the population characteristics of primary and secondary care dyspeptics.
  Many of the guidelines for primary care dyspepsia, however, are based on
  secondary care research on these referred patients. The aim of this study was
  to describe the prevalence of dyspepsia in general practice, the
  characteristics of patients presenting with dyspepsia in primary care, and the
  clinical and non-clinical determinants of referral in these patients. DESIGN:
  Cross sectional survey of the consultation records of patients presenting with
  dyspepsia in primary care during a one year period. METHODS: Dyspeptic patients
  who consulted their general practitioner (GP) in 1997 were selected on the
  basis of International Classification of Primary Care codes using a computer
  search among 20 sentinel practices affiliated with the Utrecht Network of
  General Practitioners. Cross tables and logistic regression analysis were
  carried out to reveal patient characteristics and determinants of referral.
  RESULTS: The prevalence of dyspepsia presenting in primary care in 1997 was
  3.4% (1740/48958). These patients were usually not referred during the first
  consultation. Men, elderly patients, and patients with a previous history of
  dyspepsia were referred to secondary care more frequently than other dyspeptic
  patients. Patients diagnosed with both irritable bowel syndrome and dyspepsia
  were at risk of being referred most. CONCLUSION: Dyspepsia is a frequently
  occurring complaint in primary care and patients are usually treated by their
  GP. Besides clinically relevant reasons for referral, dyspeptic patients with
  irritable bowel syndrome seem to be more "at risk" of being referred to
  secondary care than other dyspeptic patients. The differences between primary
  and secondary care dyspeptic patients should be taken into account when
  interpreting research for guideline purposes. Further research is needed to
  clarify the background of the relation between irritable bowel syndrome and
  dyspepsia and its influence on referral.

AB: The objective of the authors is to apply the control chart, a statistical
  method for quality control used in industry, to public health surveillance. A
  pilot study was conducted during the 1998 World Football Cup (WFC) by 553
  sentinel general practitioners (GPs) throughout France. The average number of
  cases of communicable, environmental and societal diseases relating to mass
  gatherings, and the total number of referrals to hospital reported daily by a
  GP, were plotted on a u-chart for each condition monitored. This average was
  beyond the statistical control limits if it fell outside the 99.7% confidence
  interval of the baseline incidences estimated before the WFC. Seven hundred and
  forty data points representing 262 279 medical encounters were plotted.
  Nineteen points exceeded the statistical control limits. None of these alerts
  was confirmed for two consecutive days. Control charts ensured that the level
  of the items chosen for general community health surveillance remained under
  control.

AB: The effects of Cu and Cd on functional responses of hemocytes in Tapes
  philippinarum, a Veneridae clam widespread in the lagoon of Venice, were
  evaluated. Bivalves were exposed for 7 days to various concentrations of
  CuCl(2) x 2H(2)O (0, 10, 60, and 110 microg/L) and CdCl(2) x H(2)O (0, 150,
  300, and 450 microg/L). Hemocytes were collected from exposed clams, and the
  effects of Cu and Cd on phagocytosis, Neutral Red retention capacity,
  superoxide dismutase, and cytochrome oxidase activities were investigated.
  Hemocytes from animals exposed to Cu showed a significant decrease in
  phagocytic activity, whereas no inhibition was observed in cells from Cd
  -exposed animals. Diffusion of Neutral Red into the cytosol, an index of
  lysosomal membrane alteration, was enhanced by high concentrations of both
  metals. Different results in biochemical parameters were observed. Exposure to
  60 and 110 microg Cu/L caused a significant reduction in hemocyte superoxide
  dismutase activity, whereas no changes resulted after Cd exposure. Increased
  cytochrome oxidase activity was observed in hemocytes from mollusks exposed to
  60 microg Cu/L and 300 microg Cd/L; no significant differences were found in
  cells from bivalves exposed to 110 microg Cu/L and 450 microg Cd/L. These
  results suggest a relationship between heavy metal exposure and alterations in
  functional responses of hemocytes in T. philippinarum and indicate that the
  type of observed effects vary with the nature and concentration of heavy
  metals. Moreover, the data obtained in the analyzed clam support the
  possibility of using it as sentinel organism in biomonitoring studies, even if
  used biomarkers will be further evaluated in field conditions.

AB: Elevated levels of moulds in homes may represent a risk for development of
  allergies and respiratory diseases. Little is known about the levels of these
  biogenic contaminants in homes in South-West Germany. This paper presents the
  results of a study which was performed between November 1997 and May 1998 in
  the four Sentinel Health Departments in Baden-Wurttemberg (Stuttgart, Mannheim,
  Kehl and Aulendorf/Bad Waldsee). It included 377 households in which children
  of 10 years of age resided. Moulds were determined in indoor air, outdoor air,
  household dust from floors and mattresses. Specific home characteristics were
  assessed by questionnaire. The median value of the number of colony forming
  units (CFU) in indoor air was 135 CFU/m3 (range 5-17,000) and in outdoor air
  145 CFU/m3 (range 15-2,900). The median value of CFU/g dust, collected from the
  floors, was 15,000 (range 0-700,000) and collected from mattresses was 28,000
  (range 1,500-1,350,000). The data suggest that an indoor-outdoor difference
  exceeding the value of 500 CFU/m3 indicates an elevated mould concentration in
  indoor air compared to background. This value can be discussed as a temporary
  reference value for South-West Germany in the winter season. However, a health
  assessment can not be derived from this value.

AB: Beef cows sometimes are pastured close to oil- and gas-production and
  processing facilities. We measured the health and productivity of cow-calf
  herds with differing exposure to sour-natural-gas processing facilities in
  western Canada. In seven cow-calf herds, the numbers of eligible mature females
  included in the study for the breeding seasons beginning in 1993, 1994, and
  1995 were 1177, 1251, and 1236, respectively. Outcomes included pregnancy
  status, calving interval, and the occurrence of twins, abortions, stillbirths,
  and neonatal mortality. Information also was collected on other risk factors
  known to influence beef-herd health and productivity.Monthly measurements from
  a network of passive air-monitoring devices were used to estimate exposure.
  Total sulfation and H2S deposition were used as markers for the complex mixture
  of compounds found in emissions from sour-gas processing plants and sour
  flares. Most herds were managed in multiple pasture groups. Cumulative exposure
  assessments were made from records of individual-animal movements between
  pastures. Generalized estimating equations were used to evaluate the
  association between exposure and outcome and to adjust for potential
  confounders and clustering of binomial outcomes within herd. No consistent
  associations were found between either total sulfation or H2S deposition and
  productivity parameters across the cow-calf production cycles. There were,
  however, five examples of significant associations between increasing
  cumulative exposure to total sulfation and decreased productivity in the 18
  models examined.

AB: In order to quickly assess potential environmental hazards of forwardly
  deployed military bases, we have focussed our efforts on biochemical and
  molecular changes in vertebrate cells following exposure to aqueous soil
  extracts. To this end, we are designing a series of deployable transgenic fish.
  Fish exhibit many of the same general defenses against toxic chemicals as do
  mammals, including enzyme induction, and the generation of oxidative stress. In
  response to many foreign compounds that generate oxidative stress, the
  transcription of certain protective genes is induced via specific DNA motifs
  called electrophile response elements (EPREs). We have made a plasmid construct
  containing a single murine EPRE fused to a minimal promoter and the cDNA
  encoding firefly luciferase (EPRE-LUC). In this paper, we have shown that the
  treatment of zebrafish cell line ZEM2S with a variety of chemicals known to
  induce EPRE-dependent transcription in cultured mammalian cells, results in
  dose-dependent induction of the transiently-transfected EPRE-LUC reporter
  construct. Compounds tested include aromatic hydrocarbons, heavy metals, and
  organophosphates. We observed similar dose-dependent responses when we treated
  ZEM2S and human cells in vitro with identical aqueous extracts of soil from
  hazardous waste sites. This suggests that the mechanism by which these
  compounds activate transcription is well conserved between mammals and
  zebrafish, and that transgenic zebrafish lines containing EPRE-driven reporter
  constructs might be useful as sentinels for the early detection of oxidative
  stress-inducing chemicals.

AB: The Department of Defense (DoD) has a unique marine mammal program
  maintained by the US Navy that includes the largest force of bottlenose
  dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, worldwide. In recent years, this population of
  cetaceans that lives in netted open water enclosures in San Diego Bay has been
  monitored for levels of organochlorine (OC) contaminants in blubber, blood and
  milk. Data generated from these studies have afforded insight into the fate and
  possible effects of OC contaminants in marine mammals. We now report
  preliminary findings on the effects of maternal OC exposure on pregnancy
  outcome. Blubber OC levels were compared between females whose calves survived
  beyond 6 months and females whose calves were stillborn or died within 12 days
  of birth. The mean concentration of SigmaDDT was more than 3 times as high
  among dolphins whose calves died as that among dolphins whose calves survived
  beyond 6 months (P = 0.002). Mean SigmaPCB was more than 2.5 times higher in
  females whose calves did not survive (P= 0.076). This population is a logical
  sentinel for the assessment of environmentally mediated disease. Biological
  tissues and fluids can be sampled on a regular basis from the dolphins for
  accumulation of tissue residues, facilitated by conditioned husbandry
  behaviors. These trained behaviors help preclude possible alterations in health
  measures resulting from capture stress. Animals' diets can be monitored for
  contaminant levels. With these data, the expertise and facilities available at
  the Navy laboratory and in collaboration with other experts in the field,
  controlled studies can be designed to monitor and assess dietary exposure,
  measurable immune and neurologic responses and assess reproductive and
  transgenerational effects of contaminants. Biomarkers can be developed to
  relate the health of individual animals relative to contaminant exposures. Such
  investigations of natural exposure and response scenarios are a logical adjunct
  to traditional laboratory toxicity studies.

AB: The presence of environmental contaminants in air, water and food may pose
  significant health risks to the exposed human population. However, problems
  associated with assessing chronic exposure to low doses of environmental
  chemicals, multiple exposure routes, diseases with long latency periods, and
  non-specific health outcomes make it difficult to conduct the appropriate human
  epidemiologic studies. It may be useful to complement human epidemiology with
  animal studies. Animals monitored or evaluated in situ for the appropriate
  suite of endpoints can provide information about both exposure levels and
  potential adverse health effects. Animals have served as sentinel indicators
  for health effects associated with a number of environmental exposures,
  including pesticides and asbestos. Pet dogs may be particularly valuable
  sentinels because they share the human environment. In addition, dogs respond
  to many toxic insults in ways analogous to humans, they have physiologically
  compressed life spans, and they are free from some important lifestyle risk
  factors for disease. An example of how pet dogs may be used as sentinels for
  potential human health hazards involves a study of the genotoxic effects
  resulting from exposure to a mixture of chemicals from nearby Superfund sites.
  We conducted a cross-sectional study of exposed dogs (living in the community
  with the Superfund sites) and controls (living in a nearby community). The pet
  owners completed a questionnaire, and we collected a blood sample from each
  dog. The blood samples were analyzed for standard clinical parameters and
  assays for possible genotoxic effects (peripheral blood lymphocyte micronucleus
  frequency and lymphocyte subtyping). Pet dogs living near the Superfund sites
  had a higher micronucleus frequency than control animals, suggesting that the
  dogs may have been exposed to environmental contaminants from these sites.

AB: Technetium 99m may now be used to identify sentinel nodes for surgical
  excision in a growing number of cancer sites. The pathology specimens of these
  sentinel nodes and of any injected tumoural sites are radioactive.
  Consequently, specific clinical and laboratory procedures must be developed to
  handle these specimens safely. It is recommended that specimens containing the
  injection site should be quarantined for a period to permit decay of
  radioactivity. This quarantine does delay the reporting of pathology results to
  surgeons, oncologists and other clinicians, but it does not adversely affect
  final patient management.

AB: Nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) terrorism counter measures are a
  major priority with healthcare providers, municipalities, states and the
  federal government. Significant resources are being invested to enhance
  civilian domestic preparedness through training in anticipation of a NBC
  terroristic incident. The key to a successful response, in addition to
  education, is integration of efforts as well as thorough communication and
  understanding the role that each agency would play in an actual or impending
  NBC incident. In anticipation of a NBC event, a regional counter-terrorism task
  force was established in southwestern Pennsylvania to identify resources,
  establish responsibilities and coordinate the response to NBC terrorism.
  Members of the task force include first responders, hazmat, law enforcement
  (local, regional, national), government officials, health departments, the
  statewide emergency management agency and the regional poison information
  center. The poison center is one of several critical components of a regional
  counter-terrorism response force. It can conduct active and passive
  toxicosurveillance and identify sentinel events. To be responsive, the poison
  center staff must be knowledgeable about biological and chemical agents. The
  development of basic protocols and a standardized staff education program is
  essential. The use of the RaPID-T (R-recognition, P-protection, D-detection, T
  -triage/treatment) course can provide basic staff education for responding to
  this important but rare consultation to the poison center.

AB: Several species of anuran amphibians have undergone drastic population
  declines in the western United States over the last 10 to 15 years. In
  California, the most severe declines are in the Sierra Mountains east of the
  Central Valley and downwind of the intensely agricultural San Joaquin Valley.
  In contrast, coastal and more northern populations across from the less
  agrarian Sacramento Valley are stable or declining less precipitously. In this
  article, we provide evidence that pesticides are instrumental in declines of
  these species. Using Hyla regilla as a sentinel species, we found that
  cholinesterase (ChE) activity in tadpoles was depressed in mountainous areas
  east of the Central Valley compared with sites along the coast or north of the
  Valley. Cholinesterase was also lower in areas where ranid population status
  was poor or moderate compared with areas with good ranid status. Up to 50% of
  the sampled population in areas with reduced ChE had detectable
  organophosphorus residues, with concentrations as high as 190 ppb wet weight.
  In addition, up to 86% of some populations had measurable endosulfan
  concentrations and 40% had detectable 4,4'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene,
  4,4'-DDT, and 2,4'-DDT residues.

AB: Routine monitoring of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and risk behaviors
  among injection drug users (IDUs) is difficult outside drug treatment settings.
  We developed and implemented a survey of recently arrested IDUs to describe the
  prevalence of HIV, drug use, and sexual behaviors among them. A probability
  sampling survey was instituted in the King County Correctional Facility in
  Seattle, Washington, to sample recently arrested IDUs at the time of booking
  and in the jail health clinic between 1998 and 1999. Following HIV risk
  assessment and blood draw, additional information on drug use practices was
  gathered using a standardized questionnaire. Potential participants who were
  released from jail early could complete the study at a nearby research
  storefront office. Of the 4,344 persons intercepted at booking, 503 (12%)
  reported injection drug use, and 201 of the IDUs (40%) participated in the
  study. An additional 161 IDUs were enrolled in the study from the jail health
  clinic. Among the 348 unduplicated subjects, HIV prevalence was 2%; in the past
  6 months, 69% reported two or more shooting partners, 72% used a cooker after
  someone else, 60% shared a syringe to divide up drugs, and 62% injected with
  used needles. Only 37% reported being hepatitis C seropositive, and 8% reported
  hepatitis B vaccination. It was feasible to conduct a jail-based survey of
  recently arrested IDUs that yielded useful information. The high prevalence of
  reported risky drug use practices warrants ongoing monitoring and illustrates
  the need for improving prevention programs for HIV and hepatitis B and C in
  this population, including expansion of hepatitis C screening and provision of
  hepatitis B vaccination at the jail health clinic.

AB: During the 1990s, considerable research and development resulted in
  reasonably reliable methods to target the set of lymph nodes most likely to
  contain metastases in patients with breast cancer. The methods of
  identification of these "sentinel nodes" (SNs) involve injection of a visual
  -based dye or a radioactive tracer. The tracer/dye enters the lymphatics and
  labels the SNs so that they can be selectively removed. SNs can be successfully
  identified in > or =90% of patients. In breast cancer patients with clinically
  negative lymph nodes, the accuracy of the SNs to predict whether any nodal
  metastases are present is > or =97%. The false-negative rate, however, ranges
  from 0% (in smaller series) to 11%. Clinical trials are in progress that will
  determine the long-term safety and predictive value of SN resection in patients
  with breast cancer. Successful application of SN surgery should allow
  elimination of conventional axillary lymphadenectomy in at least 75% of
  patients with breast cancer. Semin Oncol 28:229-235.

AB: A total of 187 different species of arboviruses and other viruses in
  vertebrates were identified at the Evandro Chagas Institute (IEC) from 1954 to
  1998, among more than 10,000 arbovirus strains isolated from humans,
  hematophagous insects, and wild and sentinel vertebrates. Despite intensive
  studies in the Brazilian Amazon region, especially in Para State, very little
  is known about most of these viruses, except for information on date, time,
  source, and method of isolation, as well as their capacity to infect laboratory
  animals. This paper reviews ecological and epidemiological data and analyzes
  the impact of vector and host population changes on various viruses as a result
  of profound changes in the natural environment. Deforestation, mining, dam and
  highway construction, human colonization, and urbanization were the main
  manmade environmental changes associated with the emergence and/or reemergence
  of relevant arboviruses, including some known pathogens for humans.

AB: This is a critical review of the methodological and motivational aspects of
  two experiences of adverse event (AE) monitoring using a surveillance diary
  incorporated into the progress notes of medical records. Methodological aspects
  of the study were that (1) AE monitoring was to become an everyday activity of
  ward physicians; (2) the physicians were to express their opinions concerning
  the causality of each AE, which was to allow the systematic detection of
  adverse drug reactions and unexplained AEs; (3) the surveillance diary was to
  include all AEs and all prescriptions, thus allowing prescription-event
  monitoring; (4) the time trends of unexplained AEs were to be monitored using
  control cards. The experiences were discontinued because the necessary
  investments were attributed to other competing priorities. It follows that it
  is essential to develop an awareness that AE surveillance requires continuous
  involvement insofar as it is an essential element of quality of care.

AB: A case-control study was carried out to determine whether residential
  exposure to environmental pollutants increased risk for canine lymphoma in pet
  dogs. One hundred one cases with cytologically or histologically confirmed
  lymphoma diagnosed at a veterinary teaching hospital between the middle of 1996
  and the middle of 1998 were examined. Controls were obtained by choosing twice
  the number of dogs without neoplastic disease, with overlapping distributions
  of province of residence, age, sex, and breed. Information regarding animal
  management, residence type, professional or hobby use of chemicals by owners,
  and treatment with herbicides or other pesticides in the area frequently
  visited by the dogs was obtained with a multiple-choice questionnaire by
  telephone interview. Two variables were positively and independently associated
  with the disease, namely residency in industrial areas (odds ratio [OR]; = 8.5;
  95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3-30.9) and use of chemicals by owners,
  specifically paints or solvents (OR = 4.6; 95% CI, 1.7-12.6). A significantly
  lower value of the mean age of disease onset was found in the group of dogs at
  risk in comparison with the group of all other dogs (6.1 +/- 0.4 years, n = 36
  versus 7.5 +/- 0.4 years, n = 65, respectively; P = .008). Variables describing
  animal care and pesticide use were either not associated with the disease or
  were uninformative. We suggest that canine lymphoma may be considered a
  sentinel of potentially hazardous situations for humans, because of the
  relatively short latency between exposure and disease onset.

AB: The principal objective of this study is to evaluate by light and electron
  microscopy (LM, EM) the heart tissues in stray southwest and northeast
  metropolitan Mexico City (SWMMC, NEMMC) dogs and compare their findings to
  those from 3 less polluted cities (Cuernavaca, Tlaxcala, and Tuxpam).
  Clinically healthy mongrel dogs, including 109 from highly polluted SWMMC and
  NEMMC, and 43 dogs from less polluted cities were studied. Dogs residing in
  cities with lower levels of pollutants showed little or no cardiac
  abnormalities. Mexico City and Cuernavaca dogs exhibited LM myocardial
  alterations including apoptotic myocytes, endothelial and immune effector
  cells, degranulated mast cells associated with scattered foci of mononuclear
  cells in left and right ventricles and interventricular septum, and clusters of
  adipocytes interspersed with mononuclear cells. Vascular changes included
  scattered polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) margination and microthrombi in
  capillaries, and small venous and arteriolar blood vessels. Small veins
  exhibited smooth muscle cell hyperplasia, and arteriolar blood vessels showed
  deposition of particulate matter (PM) in the media and adventitia. Unmyelinated
  nerve fibers showed endoneural and epineural degranulated mast cells. EM
  examination of myocardial mast cells showed distended and abundant rough
  endoplasmic reticulum with few secretory granules. Myocardial capillaries
  exhibited fibrin deposition and their endothelial cells displayed increased
  luminal and abluminal pinocytic activity and the formation of anemone-like
  protrusions of the endothelium into the lumen. A close association between
  myocardial findings, lung epithelial and endothelial pathology, and chronic
  inflammatory lung changes was noted. The myocardial changes described in dogs
  exposed to ambient air pollutants may form the basis for developing hypothesis
  -driven mechanistic studies that might explain the epidemiological data of
  increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in people exposed to air
  pollutants.

AB: A complex mixture of air pollutants is present in the ambient air in urban
  areas. People, animals, and vegetation are chronically and sequentially exposed
  to outdoor pollutants. The objective of this first of 2 studies is to evaluate
  by light and electron microscopy the lungs of Mexico City dogs and compare the
  results to those of 3 less polluted cities in MEXICO: One hundred fifty-two
  clinically healthy stray mongrel dogs (91 males/61 females), including 43 dogs
  from 3 less polluted cities, and 109 from southwest and northeast metropolitian
  Mexico City (SWMMC, NEMMC) were studied. Lungs of dogs living in Mexico City
  and Cuernavaca exhibited patchy chronic mononuclear cell infiltrates along with
  macrophages loaded with particulate matter (PM) surrounding the bronchiolar
  walls and extending into adjacent vascular structures; bronchiolar epithelial
  and smooth muscle hyperplasia, peribronchiolar fibrosis, microthrombi, and
  capillary and venule polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) margination. Ultrafine
  PM was seen in alveolar type I and II cells, endothelial cells, interstitial
  macrophages (Mtheta), and intravascular Mtheta-like cells. Bronchoalveolar
  lavage showed significant numbers of alveolar macrophages undergoing
  proliferation. Exposure to complex mixtures of pollutants-predominantly
  particulate matter and ozone-is causing lung structural changes induced by the
  sustained inflammatory process and resulting in airway and vascular remodeling
  and altered repair. Cytokines released from both, circulating inflammatory and
  resident lung cells in response to endothelial and epithelial injury may be
  playing a role in the pathology described here. Deep concern exists for the
  potential of an increasing rise in lung diseases in child populations exposed
  to Mexico City's environment.

AB: The acute toxicity assay with premetamorphic tadpoles of Bufo arenarum as
  sentinel organism was applied to evaluate the quality of two water samples
  taken from three sites of the Reconquista River, an urban watercourse which is
  recipient of both untreated industrial effluents and domestic wastes. The
  results of the 96 hr bioassays were compared with the physicochemical
  parameters determined in the samples. Mortality rates in each sample were
  compared using the Bonferroni's test and a stepwise regression analysis of
  mortality and physicochemical parameters was done. In this way, it was possible
  to build up consistent descriptive models which showed that pH, Cl- Cd2+ and
  Cu2+ concentrations in the river water were significant independent variables
  and might explain, under the experimental conditions, the recorded toxicity
  effects of the tested samples. Because of its simplicity, low cost and
  reliability it was suggested the tadpoles bioassay be included in the set of
  tests used in integrated program of freshwater pollution.

AB: The incidence of occupational dermatitis of the hands is particularly high
  in the hairdressing trade. To elucidate the role of various risk factors, and
  to ultimately improve primary prevention of occupational hand dermatitis, a
  prospective cohort study was conducted between 1992 and 1997, including 2352
  hairdressing trainees. Already six weeks after the start of training (median)
  35.4% had--usually mild--irritant skin changes, mainly involving the
  interdigital web spaces. These were associated with subsequent, possibly more
  severe, hand dermatitis. Reduced exposure to wet work, i.e., improved skin
  protection with gloves, often led to the resolution of dermatitis of the hands.
  In conclusion, early irritant skin damage is a sentinel event that heralds
  possibly disabling occupational skin disease and should prompt adequate
  preventive measures.

AB: Monocrotophos is the single largest selling agrochemical in India. Sensitive
  biomarkers to study the genotoxic effects caused by monocrotophos in aquatic
  organisms, especially fish, are lacking. The fish used in this study are
  Tilapia mossambica, which are edible, commercially valuable and distributed all
  over India. The objective of this study was to study DNA strand breaks induced
  by monocrotophos in T. mossambica in vivo using single-cell micro gel
  electrophoresis/comet assay. Tilapia were treated orally with 0.313, 0.625,
  1.25, 1.875, 2.5, 3.125, 3.75 and 4.375 ppm of monocrotophos and the assay was
  performed on nucleated erythrocytes after 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. A significant
  increase in mean comet tail-length (5.21-7.46 microM), indicating DNA damage,
  was observed at all the doses with monocrotophos when compared to controls
  (3.36 microM). The mean tail-length showed a dose-related increase and time
  -dependent decrease. The maximum increase in mean comet tail-length was
  observed at 24 h. Relative to these effects, reductions in mean comet tail
  -length were seen at 48 and 72 h. By 96 h, values had returned to control
  levels at all doses, indicating repair of the damaged DNA and/or loss of
  heavily damaged cells. The study reveals that the comet assay is a sensitive
  and rapid method to detect genotoxicity of monocrotophos and other
  environmental pollutants in sentinel species.

AB: OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess the significance of normal
  endometrial cells identified in screening Pap smears from asymptomatic
  postmenopausal women taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT). METHODS:
  Endometrial histology reported from 93 asymptomatic postmenopausal women
  receiving HRT noted to have normal endometrial cells on a screening Pap smear
  was reviewed. Information regarding HRT, endometrial sampling, and interval
  between the sentinel Pap and sampling was extracted from the record. RESULTS:
  Endometrial biopsies were obtained an average of 1.7 months after the Pap
  smears. Eighteen of the ninety-three histology specimens (19%, 95% CI: 12--27%)
  identified abnormalities, in four cases precancerous or cancerous lesions.
  These 18 abnormalities included 7 endometrial polyps; 7 cases of simple
  hyperplasia, 1 with atypia; 3 cases of complex hyperplasia, 1 with atypia; and
  1 endometrial adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSION: Normal endometrial cells identified
  on a screening Pap smear in this population may be an indication of endometrial
  disease.

RN: 0; 7440-26-8
AB: Sentinel node was detected by 99mTc labeled nanocolloid in five patients
  with breast cancer. Surgery of breast cancer was done at 16 hours after the
  administration of 74 MBq of 99mTc labeled nanocolloid. Sentinel node was
  searched by scintigraphy prior to surgery and by gamma-probe during surgery.
  Radioactivity of injected site, sentinel nodes, blood contaminated gauze, and
  other garbage was measured by GM detector. Radiation to medical staffs was
  monitored by a pocket radiation detector and film batches. Sentinel nodes were
  successfully detected both by scintigraphy and gamma-detector. More than 70% of
  radioactivity remained in the administered site at 16 hours. Small amount of
  radioactivity was detectable in the sentinel node. Almost no radioactivity was
  detectable in blood-contaminated gauze and other garbage. Radiation dose to the
  main surgeon was 4 to 6 microSv per surgery by a pocket radiation detector.
  Radiation dose to the assistant surgeon was 2 microSv per surgery. Radiation
  dose by labeling or injection was 0 to 1 microSv per procedure. No detectable
  radiation was measured by film batches. It is concluded that the detection of

AB: Sentinel species are biological monitors that accumulate a pollutant in
  their tissues without significant adverse effects. Primarily used to measure
  the amount of a pollutant that is biologically available, they may also
  increase the sensitivity of an analytical procedure or summarise a complex
  pollution signal. This paper examines the validation of sentinels, referring
  particularly to the use of invertebrates in monitoring toxic metal pollution in
  terrestrial ecosystems. Few studies measure the capacity of a sentinel to
  quantify changes in ambient levels. Definitions of 'bioavailability' also
  differ between workers and few note that this may be a highly species-specific
  measure. Validation requires that the temporal and spatial scales over which a
  sentinel integrates a pollution signal are known. The sentinel has to be
  calibrated against source concentrations and this relationship shown to be
  consistent over the normal range of exposure. This requires some consideration
  of the environmental and biological determinants of pollutant assimilation.
  Differences between populations can confound simple comparisons between sites
  based on native populations. Transplanted individuals, matched for age, sex and
  physiological state, might be used when the aim is not to assess
  bioavailability to the resident population. A simple measure of their capacity
  to detect differences in ambient pollutant levels is proposed to evaluate
  candidate species, to assess their consistency and capacity to equilibrate with
  their source. A small survey of earthworms from a well-defined gradient of Pb
  pollution is used to illustrate problems of interpreting tissue concentrations
  in sentinels.

AB: Within the ongoing strategy of the Workers' Health program at the Pan
  American Health Organization on strengthening surveillance in the field of
  workers' health in the Americas (the Region), a project was conducted in July
  1999 in Washington, D.C. The objectives of the project were to discuss the
  problems found in the surveillance of workers' health, to develop a methodology
  and use it to prioritize and select the top three occupational sentinel health
  events for incorporation into the surveillance systems in the Region, and to
  develop the initial protocols for establishing the surveillance systems for the
  three chosen occupational sentinel health events. The Pan American Health
  Organization invited 24 occupational health experts from the Region to
  participate in the project. Over an intensive 3-day period, the experts heard
  reports of workplace surveillance activities in the various countries in the
  Region; developed prioritization methods; identified and prioritized a list of
  occupational sentinel health events; and developed three surveillance
  protocols, one each for occupational fatal injuries, pesticide poisoning, and
  low back pain. The results on the prioritization of occupational sentinel
  health events and the development of surveillance protocols are reported in
  this article.

AB: Southwest Metropolitan Mexico City (SWMMC) children are repeatedly exposed
  to a complex mixture of air pollutants, including ozone, particulate matter,
  and aldehydes. Nasal biopsies taken from these children exhibit a wide range of
  histopathologic alterations: marked changes in ciliated and goblet cell
  populations, basal cell hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, and mild dysplasias.
  We studied the ultrastructural features of 15 nasal biopsies obtained from
  clinically healthy children 4 to 15 yr of age, growing up in SWMMC. The results
  were compared with nasal biopsies from 11 children growing up in Veracruz and
  exposed to low pollutant levels. Ultrathin sections of nasal biopsies revealed
  an unremarkable mucociliary epithelium in control children, whereas SWMMC
  children showed an epithelium comprised of variable numbers of basal, ciliated,
  goblet, and squamous metaplastic as well as intermediate cells. Nascent
  ciliated cells, as evidenced by the presence of migratory kinetosomes, were
  common, as were ciliary abnormalities, including absent central microtubules,
  supernumerary central and peripheral tubules, ciliary microtubular
  discontinuities, and compound cilia. Dyskinesia associated with these abnormal
  cilia was suggested by the altered orientation of the central microtubules in
  closely adjacent cilia. A transudate was evident between epithelial cells,
  suggesting potential deficiencies in epithelial junction integrity. Particulate
  matter was present in heterolysosomal bodies in epithelial cells and it was
  also deposited in intercellular spaces. The severe structural alteration of the
  nasal epithelium together with the prominent acquired ciliary defects are
  likely the result of chronic airway injury in which ozone, particulate matter,
  and aldehydes are thought to play a crucial role. The nasal epithelium in SWMMC
  children is fundamentally disordered, and their mucociliary defense mechanisms
  are no longer intact. A compromised nasal epithelium has less ability to
  protect the lower respiratory tract and may potentially leave the distal acinar
  airways more vulnerable to reactive gases. Impairment of mucociliary clearance
  has the potential to increase the contact time between deposited mutagenic
  particulate matter and the epithelial surface, thus increasing the risk for
  nasal carcinogenesis. Chronic exposures to air pollutants affect the whole
  respiratory tract; the nasal epithelium is an accessible and valuable sentinel
  to monitor exposures to toxic or carcinogenic substances.

AB: PURPOSE: Sentinel lymph node mapping, involving injection of isosulfan blue
  dye around a tumour, is beginning to be used in patients with carcinoma of the
  breast. Absorption of the dye into the circulation may interfere with pulse
  oximetry, causing falsely low readings. This report describes changes in pulse
  oximeter readings following injection of isosulfan blue for sentinel lymph node
  mapping in a patient with carcinoma of the breast. CLINICAL FEATURES: An 83-yr
  -old female patient underwent sentinel node biopsy of the axilla followed by
  partial mastectomy for carcinoma of the left breast. Isosulfan blue was
  injected in the area of the tumour in the left breast. The SpO2 began to
  decrease 15 min after dye injection, reaching a nadir of 89-90% 30 min after
  injection. Arterial blood gas analysis showed normal arterial partial pressure
  of oxygen. Pulse oximeter readings did not return to normal until more than six
  hours after dye injection. CONCLUSION: Review of the literature reveals a small
  number of case reports of similar occurrences of low pulse oximeter readings
  following injection of isosulfan blue or patent blue dye for lymphatic mapping.
  Data from these reports and the case described here suggest that the latency,
  magnitude and duration of effect on pulse oximeter readings following injection
  of these dyes is highly variable. It is important to rule out other causes of
  low pulse oximeter readings when this effect occurs; normal oxygenation can be
  verified with arterial blood gas analysis. Co-oximetry can be done to rule out
  methemoglobinemia as a cause of decreased SpO2.

AB: BACKGROUND: Work-related asthma is a leading cause of occupational
  respiratory illness. METHODS: Work-related asthma was studied in California
  over a 36-month period, from March 1, 1993 to February 29, 1996. The
  surveillance system identified cases from Doctor's First Reports (DFRs), a
  mandated physician reporting system. Structured follow-up telephone interviews
  of DFR asthma cases were conducted to collect work history, exposure, and
  medical information. Statewide employment data was used to calculate disease
  rates among industry groups. RESULTS: Based on 945 cases of work-related
  asthma, the average annual reporting rate for work-related asthma in California
  was 25/million workers. We estimate that the actual rate is 78/million,
  adjusted for likely underreporting. Janitors and cleaners (625/million) and
  firefighters (300/million) had the highest reporting rates of work-related
  asthma. Half of all work-related asthma cases were associated with agents not
  known to be allergens. CONCLUSIONS: A greater proportion of work-related asthma
  associated with irritant exposures was identified than has previously been
  reported. The surveillance data provide a very conservative estimate of the
  incidence of work-related asthma.

AB: BACKGROUND: This surveillance study was undertaken to target efforts to
  prevent work-related carpal tunnel syndrome (WR-CTS) and to assess physician
  case-reports as a source of surveillance data. METHODS: Physician case-reports
  and workers' compensation disability claims were used to document patterns of
  WR-CTS in Massachusetts from March 1992 to June 1997 by age, gender, industry,
  occupation, and calendar year. Characteristics of cases identified through the
  two data sources were compared. RESULTS: 4,836 cases of WR-CTS were
  ascertained; 6% were identified by both data sources. Whereas the two sets of
  cases were similar with respect to age and occupation categories, physician
  -reported cases were more likely male and employed in manufacturing. The number
  of compensation claims filed by women declined over time, and a substantial
  number of cases under age 25 years were identified. Manufacturing workers had
  the highest rates; the highest numbers of cases were employed in hospitals,
  grocery stores, and the insurance industry. Several technical/administrative
  support occupations likely to use video display terminals had both high rates
  and frequencies. CONCLUSION: WR-CTS is a significant public health problem.
  Physician reports are useful in understanding problem magnitude and targeting
  specific establishments for intervention but are currently of limited use in
  targeting specific industries and occupations.

AB: Ciguatera is a widespread ichthyosarcotoxaemia with dramatic and clinically
  important neurological features. This severe form of fish poisoning may present
  with either acute or chronic intoxication syndromes and constitutes a global
  health problem. Ciguatera poisoning is little known in temperate countries as a
  potentially global problem associated with human ingestion of large carnivorous
  fish that harbour the bioaccumulated ciguatoxins of the photosynthetic
  dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus toxicus. This neurotoxin is stored in the viscera
  of fish that have eaten the dinoflagellate and concentrated it upwards
  throughout the food chain towards progressively larger species, including
  humans. Ciguatoxin accumulates in all fish tissues, especially the liver and
  viscera, of "at risk" species. Both Pacific (P-CTX-1) and Caribbean (C-CTX-1)
  ciguatoxins are heat stable polyether toxins and pose a health risk at
  concentrations above 0.1 ppb. The presenting signs of ciguatera are primarily
  neurotoxic in more than 80% of cases. Such include the pathognomonic features
  of postingestion paraesthesiae, dysaesthesiae, and heightened nociperception.
  Other sensory abnormalities include the subjective features of metallic taste,
  pruritis, arthralgia, myalgia, and dental pain. Cerebellar dysfunction,
  sometimes diphasic, and weakness due to both neuropathy and polymyositis may be
  encountered. Autonomic dysfunction leads to hypotension, bradycardia, and
  hypersalivation in severe cases. Ciguatoxins are potent, lipophilic sodium
  channel activator toxins which bind to the voltage sensitive (site 5) sodium
  channel on the cell membranes of all excitable tissues. Treatment depends on
  early diagnosis and the early administration of intravenous mannitol. The early
  identification of the neurological features in sentinel patients has the
  potential to reduce the number of secondary cases in cluster outbreaks.

AB: The Hunter Public Health Unit in Australia is conducting a population-based
  enhanced surveillance of foodborne disease in the Hunter region of New South
  Wales, using a method similar to the FoodNet used in the USA. To improve
  timeliness, sensitivity and representativeness of data, surveillance for
  laboratory-confirmed cases of Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, Listeria,
  Yersinia, Vibrio, Cryptosporidium, Giardia and Hepatitis A will be developed.
  Participating centres are listed. Effects of laboratory practice on
  surveillance data are also being evaluated using a short survey of laboratory
  practices, and risk factors are being determined for infection by Salmonella
  and Campylobacter in a 1-yr prospective case-control study running from Jan.
  1999. Costs of the new sentinel surveillance system are considered in terms of
  its expansion to the whole of Australia.

AB: High-level environmental contamination has been documented as eliciting
  negative effects on endocrine, reproductive and developmental events across
  vertebrate groups in the wild. Of particular interest and importance is whether
  relatively low levels of mixtures of environmental pollutants may have long
  -term impacts. We are investigating responses to ground and surface-water
  pollution from plumes on the MMR Superfund site on Cape Cod, MA, in the turtle
  Chrysemys picta. Parameters examined included hepatic cytochrome P450 1A
  (CYP1A) activity and protein, glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity, plasma
  vitellogenin levels, and metallothionein protein. Hepatic microsomal EROD
  activity in both males and females was higher at the plume-impacted site than
  at the non-impacted site; a seasonal pattern of activity was seen at both
  sites. The level of CYP1A protein expression was greater at the impacted site.
  GST activity also followed a seasonal pattern, but there were no significant
  differences in activity between the two sites. Plasma vitellogenin levels,
  although influenced by endogenous estrogen, were significantly lower in animals
  from plume impacted than non-impacted sites. Serum vitellogenin levels were
  very low to non-detectable in males. Metallothionein levels show a sex-specific
  difference at the non-impacted site only; there were no significant differences
  between the sites. Taken together, the observed changes suggest a potential
  ground water pollution impact on the endemic biota. These changes are of
  concern since they suggest that chronic exposure to low level mixtures of
  contaminants may represent long-term impacts.

AB: With the aim of developing biomarkers of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon
  (PAH) genotoxicity for biomonitoring of the marine environment, the formation
  of DNA adducts and oxidative DNA damage was studied in the sentinel organism
  Mytilus. Mussels M. galloprovincialis were exposed for 21 d to different doses
  of benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) (50 and 100 mg B[a]P/kg dry wt mussel /d) via trophic
  intake. The kinetics of B[a]P concentration in whole mussel tissues was
  determined in both groups, and a dose-response study was conducted for both
  gill B[a]P-related DNA adducts and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8
  -oxodGuo) formation in gill and digestive gland DNA. Exposure was followed by a
  10 d depuration period to study mussel recovery. Although B[a]P was absorbed
  and bioaccumulated to very high concentrations (>300 mg B[a]P/kg dry wt
  mussel), plateau values were not reached in either assay group. Regardless of
  the exposure dose of B[a]P, several bulky DNA adducts were induced in the
  typical PAH diagonal radioactive zone. For both doses, positive correlations
  were found between total DNA adduct level and both exposure time and B[a]P
  concentration in whole mussel tissues. DNA repair during depuration differed
  among the B[a]P-induced DNA adducts. B[a]P exposure had no effect on gill 8
  -oxodGuo levels, but led to a significant dosedependent increase in the number
  of oxidative lesions in mussel digestive gland DNA. The decrease with
  depuration in digestive gland 8-oxodGuo levels to control values was indicative
  of the mussels' ability to recover from oxidative DNA damage.

AB: Mitotic root micronucleus (MCN) frequency in Vicia faba as a bioassay, is
  primarily based on the extent of the sentinel Viola response in terms of
  cytogenetic damage quantitatively or qualitatively to indicate the presence of
  mutagenic contaminants. This paper describes an investigation designed to
  assess changes in MCN frequencies of Vicia faba from three generation plants
  obtained, respectively from a reference site (RS) and a metal-contaminated
  experimental field (EF) in the bioassay of mutagenic Cd super(2+) and NaN
  sub(3). The background value, dose-response to Cd super(2+) and to NaN sub(3)
  in three generation (F sub(1), F sub(2) and F sub(3)) plants of the EF and the
  initial (F sub(0)) plants were determined in terms of MCN frequencies. With
  more generations of growing Vicia plants in the EF, a higher background value
  of MCN frequency, a lower slope value in the regression equation, a smaller
  ratio of MCN frequency between the control and treatment in the same generation
  and larger perturbation values were observed. This denotes that the decreased
  reliability and efficiency are represented in Vicia plants from the EF if the
  plants are used as sentinels in the bioassay of mutagenic Cd super(2+) and NaN
  sub(3). It was concluded that the Vicia MCN bioassay should be used as an
  endpoint biomarker acceptable in biomonitoring environmental mutagens when the
  sentinel plants were collected from clean areas. Because no place is absolutely
  without pollutants, it is suggested that several seed stock centers should be
  established for providing sentinel Vicia if Vicia MCN bioassay is used as a
  biomarker to identify the global environmental status.

AB: Fish morbidity and mortality events in Chesapeake Bay tributaries have
  aroused concern over the health of this important aquatic ecosystem. We applied
  a recently described method for quantifying mRNA of an immunosuppressive
  cytokine, transforming growth factor- beta (TGF- beta ), by reverse
  transcription quantitative-competitive polymerase chain reaction to a field
  study of fish health in the Chesapeake Basin, and compared the results to those
  of a traditional cellular immunoassay macrophage bactericidal activity. We
  selected the white perch (Morone americana) as the sentinel fish species
  because of its abundance at all of the collection sites. White perch were
  sampled from Chesapeake Bay tributaries in June, August, and October 1998.
  Splenic mononuclear cell TGF- beta mRNA levels increased and anterior kidney
  macrophage bactericidal activity decreased, particularly in eastern shore
  tributaries, from June to August and October. The results of the two assays
  correlated inversely (Kendall's tau b = -0.600; p = 0.0102). The results
  indicated both temporal and spatial modulation of white perch immune systems in
  the Chesapeake Basin, and demonstrated the utility of quantitative PCR for TGF-
  beta as a molecular biomarker for field assessment of teleost fish immune
  status.

AB: A study of malaria prevalence and transmission was carried out in Khartoum,
  the capital of Sudan. The sentinel sites were El manshia, an urban area on the
  Blue Nile and Ed dekheinat, a lower-income peri-urban area bordering the White
  Nile. Anopheles arabiensis, the only malaria vector encountered, was present
  throughout the year although vector density varied seasonally. Plasmodium
  falciparum was the only species found in El manshia. In Ed dekheinat P.
  falciparum, Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium vivax constituted 84.9, 8.2 and
  6.9% of the cases, respectively. Plasmodium ovale appears to have recently
  spread into Khartoum since it has not previously been reported there. We
  conclude that focal transmission of malaria in the districts bordering both
  Niles has become established and that the reservoir of human infections has
  increased in recent years leading to increased risk of malaria epidemics,
  particularly in the aftermath of seasonal flooding.

  the genotoxicity of air pollutants was carried out by sentinel approach, using
  the plant grown in the field or using the plants in pots which were carried to

  Cesar and Congonhas) and two rural sites (the cities of Pirassununga, 200 km
  and Caucaia do Alto, 50 km from Sao Paulo, respectively) were chosen for this
  study, in order to determine the gradient difference of the air pollution
  levels. Sentinel plants in Congonhas site presented the highest frequency of
  micronuclei (4.4%), in comparison with 2.2 and 2.3% found in plants from
  Pirassununga and Cerqueira Cesar sites, respectively (Kruskal-Wallis; P <
  0.020). Significant increases (F test; P < 0.0001) in the frequency of
  micronuclei were observed in plants exposed in the polluted urban sites
  (Cerqueira Cesar: 5.7%; Congonhas: 7.1% and Caucaia do Alto: 2.3%). The
  increase in the frequency of micronuclei observed indicates the potential risk
  of mutagenicity in presence of high concentrations of pollutants.

AB: Nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) terrorism countermeasures are a major
  priority with municipalities, healthcare providers, and the federal government.
  Significant resources are being invested to enhance civilian domestic
  preparedness by conducting education at every response level in anticipation of
  a NBC terroristic incident. The key to a successful response, in addition to
  education, is integration of efforts as well as thorough communication and
  understanding the role that each agency would play in an actual or impending
  NBC incident. In anticipation of a NBC event, a regional counter-terrorism task
  force was established to identify resources, establish responsibilities and
  coordinate the response to NBC terrorism. Members of the task force included
  first responders, hazmat, law enforcement (local, regional, national),
  government officials, the health department, and the regional poison
  information center. Response protocols were developed and education was
  conducted, culminating in all members of the response task force becoming
  certified NBC instructors. The poison center participated actively in 3
  incidents of suspected biologic and chemical terrorism: an alleged anthrax
  -contaminated letter sent to a women's health clinic; a possible sarin gas
  release in a high school; and a potential anthrax/ebola contamination incident
  at an international airport. All incidents were determined hoaxes. The regional
  response plan establishes the poison information center as a common repository
  for all cases in a biological or chemical incident. The poison center is one of
  several critical components of a regional counter-terrorism response force. It
  can conduct active and passive toxicosurveillance and identify sentinel events.
  To be responsive, the poison center staff must be knowledgeable about
  biological and chemical agents. The development of basic protocols and a
  standardized staff education program is essential. The use of the RaPiD-T (R
  -recognition, P-protection, D-detection, T-triage/treatment) course can provide
  basic staff education for responding to this important but rare consultation to
  the poison center.

AB: Long-term monitoring of reservoir fish assemblages can provide insight into
  the development, community structure, and stability of economically important
  fisheries. A sentinel-site approach was used to assess changes in the offshore
  fish assemblage of a 36,000-ha impoundment (Lake Texoma) across 43 years.
  Fishes were sampled intensively year-round using gill nets in 1954, 1981-1984,
  and 1996-1997. Assemblage structure, overall, was relatively stable across
  years as indicated by persistence of species, significant concordance in rank
  abundance, relatively low cv of species abundances among years, and overlapping
  sample scores in multivariate space. However, some individual species varied in
  abundance across decades. Stepwise discriminant analysis revealed six species
  that could be used to discriminate collections among decades. A more detailed
  evaluation of changes in the fish assemblage between the 1980s and the 1990s
  that included size-structure and species associations showed little variation
  between decades. However, two species, smallmouth buffalo (Ictiobus bubalus)
  <400 min in length and striped bass (Morone saxatilis) <250 mm in length were
  in greater abundance in the 1990s. Based on this and previous studies, the fish
  assemblage in Lake Texoma appears to be relatively stable. There is evidence to
  suggest that populations of introduced species are more susceptible to abiotic
  disturbances than are native riverine fishes.

AB: Metal body burden (BB) was analyzed in three groups of organisms evaluated
  as sentinel monitors of metal exposure. The study site was a lotic system of
  moderate gradient that received effluent outfalls from an uranium enrichment
  plant. Metal BBs (e.g., Ag, Cd, Cr, Cu) increased in the order Cheumatopsyche
  spp. (caddisfly), Campostoma anomalum (central stoneroller minnow), and
  Stenonema spp. (mayfly). This was consistent with their classifications as
  metal-tolerant, moderately tolerant, and sensitive taxa, respectively. The Ag,
  Cd, and Cu BBs in stoneroller minnows from upstream, effluent-receiving, and
  downstream stations correlated strongly with macroinvertebrate bioassessment
  (BA) scores (r less than or equal to -0.95), numbers of taxa (r = -0.95), and
  the Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera indices (r = -0.82 to -0.94).
  Proportional differences in metal BBs in the minnow were used to derive metal
  multiplers that were applied to total recoverable metal concentrations to
  calculate bioavailable metal. The bioavailable metal fractions correlated with
  BA scores and numbers of taxa (e.g., Ag, r less than or equal to -0.97; Cu, r =
  -0.95). When five metals (i.e., Ag, Cd, Cu, Cr, Pb) were included in an
  additive model, results also correlated with BA scores (r = -0.93) and numbers
  of taxa (r = -0.86). Metal BB in minnows was a strong indicator of ecological
  impact and provided a means of determining bioavailable metals. Also, we
  describe the development of the metal biosensor, which incorporates a
  reconstructed fish gill epithelium, the primary target of metal exposure. This
  in vitro biosensor should directly quantify bioreactive metals that cross the
  epithelium and react with a genetically engineered intracellular detector. This
  biosensor complements biotic ligand models based on surface binding of metals
  to gill epithelia.

  (Pollution Effect Network, PEN) is proposed here, consisting of the realisation
  of an on-line warehouse for biomarker data (http://www.muf.unipmn.it/pen). The
  web site will contain repository sections and expert system procedures able to
  integrate information from different biomarkers and provide ranking of the
  organism health status in terms of synthetic stress syndrome indexes.
  Researchers accessing the site will be able to submit and process their own
  data. This will allow common criteria in the evaluation of the biological
  effects of pollutants, and an intercomparison of biomonitoring data among
  different geographic areas and sentinel species.

AB: With the aim of developing biomarkers of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon
  (PAH) genotoxicity for biomonitoring of the marine environment, the formation
  of DNA adducts and oxidative DNA damage was studied in the sentinel organism
  Mytilus. Mussels M. galloprovincialis were exposed for 21 d to different doses
  of benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) (50 and 100 mg B[a]P kg super(-1) dry wt mussel d
  super(-1)) via trophic intake. The kinetics of B[a]P concentration in whole
  mussel tissues was determined in both groups, and a dose-response study was
  conducted for both gill B[a]P-related DNA adducts and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'
  -deoxyguanosine (8-oxodGuo) formation in gill and digestive gland DNA. Exposure
  was followed by a 10 d depuration period to study mussel recovery. Although
  B[a]P was absorbed and bioaccumulated to very high concentrations (>300 mg
  B[a]P kg super(-1) dry wt mussel), plateau values were not reached in either
  assay group. Regardless of the exposure dose of B[a]P, several bulky DNA
  adducts were induced in the typical PAH diagonal radioactive zone. For both
  doses, positive correlations were found between total DNA adduct level and both
  exposure time and B[a]P concentration in whole mussel tissues. DNA repair
  during depuration differed among the B[a]P-induced DNA adducts. B[a]P exposure
  had no effect on gill 8-oxodGuo levels, but led to a significant dose-dependent
  increase in the number of oxidative lesions in mussel digestive gland DNA. The
  decrease with deputation in digestive gland 8-oxodGuo levels to control values
  was indicative of the mussels' ability to recover from oxidative DNA damage.

AB: Five biomarkers (MT: metallothionein-like proteins, EROD: ethoxyresorufin
  ortho-d e e thylase, DNA strand breaks, LPO: peroxidation of lipids, VG:
  vitellogenin-like protiens) were measured in the soft tissues of zebra mussels
  (Dreissena polymorpha) in order to assess the spatial variation of exposure to
  contaminants along the St Lawrence River (Canada). Fifteen mussels >25 mm shell
  length were analyzed from each of the 13 sampling sites. Significant
  differences between sites were noted for all biomarkers, but the general level
  of variability was low. Three biomarkers (DNA, LPO and VG) exhibited a similar
  pattern of spatial variation while MT and EROD had distinct and specific
  patterns. MT had the strongest discriminating power and EROD showed the largest
  range of variation among sites. Highest biomarker responses were measured in
  specimens from local contaminated sites such as harbors and industrial sectors.
  A positive relationship was found between MT and copper (Cu), but no
  significant correlation was observed between other biomarker responses and the
  levels of ten trace metals bioaccumulating in the zebra mussels tissues.
  Results indicate that the measurement of biomarker responses is technically
  feasible. The performance of each biomarker is assessed in the context of the
  role and advantages of selecting a battery of biomarkers for detecting
  contamination problems. The use of zebra mussels as a sentinel species for
  biomonitoring potential toxic effects in situ is discussed.

AB: The enhanced formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a common pathway
  of toxicity induced by stressful environmental conditions. In polar
  environments, characterization of antioxidant defences in key sentinel species
  may be of particular value as early detection biomarkers of unforeseen effects
  of human activities which are progressively increasing in these remote areas.
  The complexities associated with predicting the consequences at the 'organism
  level' of variations of specific antioxidant defences have been recently
  overcome by the ability to quantify an index of specific biological resistance
  to various kinds of ROS.The total oxyradical scavenging capacity (TOSC) assay
  has been used in three species of scallops for quantifying their ability to
  neutralize peroxyl and hydroxyl radicals and peroxynitrite (HOONO). Adamussium
  colbecki and Chlamys islandicus represent key organisms for monitoring
  Antarctic and Arctic regions while Pecten jacobaeus was chosen for a comparison
  with a related temperate species.

AB: Environmental epidemiology is the specialized aspect of public health
  science that studies human health risk from environmental hazards. It is rises
  largely upon a foundation of public health surveillance, and relies heavily
  upon analyses of data for small areas and sparse population groups. To a
  degree, environmental epidemiology is assigned the role of discerning very
  subtle human health impacts, or discerning early evidence of a tragic sequence.
  In that context, environmental epidemiology has a substantial public education
  and risk communication role. Environmental epidemiology will be greatly
  advanced as effective biological markers of exposure and precursor health
  effects are developed. At this point in time, statistical methods are in place
  to monitor population-level disease rates in high-risk populations for early
  risk identification and sentinel event recognition. Advances in geographic
  methods have provided a boon to the discipline by advantaging spatial studies.
  These advances in the discipline still need further refinement and pilot
  experiences. The inclusion of environmental epidemiological considerations with
  instances of proposed industrial expansion, hazardous waste management, and
  contamination remediation is heartily recommended.

AB: This paper presents the concentration of super(210)Po in five species of
  bivalve molluscs (Donax faba, D. cuneatus, Scapharca inaequivalvis, Pinctada
  vulgaris and Perna indica) from Gulf of Mannar, southeast coast of India. The
  levels of super(210)Po among the tested species ranged from 65.8 to 2668.9 Bq
  kg-1. Analyses indicated that the soft tissues of the bivalves registered a
  higher level of super(210)Po than the shells. Further, analyses also showed a
  non-uniformity in the distribution of super(210)Po in the various internal
  organs. The concentration recorded in them maintained the following descending
  order: digestive glands > viscera > gills > foot > mantle > sell. It is evident
  that P. indica could be used as a sentinel organisms for super(210)Po in the
  ambient waters.

AB: The extensive use of biomarkers in environment biomonitoring programmes has
  raised the problem of data management and intercomparison. A research project
  (Pollution Effect Network, PEN) is proposed here, consisting of the realisation
  of an on-line warehouse for biomarker data (http://www.muf.unipmn.it/pen). The
  web site will contain repository sections and expert system procedures able to
  integrate information from different biomarkers and provide ranking of the
  organism health status in terms of synthetic stress syndrome indexes.
  Researchers accessing the site will be able to submit and process their own
  data. This will allow common criteria in the evaluation of the biological
  effects of pollutants, and an intercomparison of biomonitoring data among
  different geographic areas and sentinel species.

AB: Within the frame of the 2nd Iberian Congress of Environmental Contamination
  and Toxicology a workshop was held about the use of biomarkers in marine
  pollution monitoring. Among others, the following biomarkers received special
  attention: metallothionein induction, acetylcholinesterase inhibition,
  cytochrome P450 system induction, imposex, lysosomal enlargement and lysosomal
  membrane destabilisation, and peroxisome proliferation. These biomarkers can be
  used to evaluate exposure to and effect of different contaminants (metals,
  organic xenobiotics and organometallic compounds) and they can be measured
  using different methodological approaches (biochemistry, cytochemistry,
  immunochemical methods based on the use of biotechnology). Before the
  application of a set of biomarkers in pollution monitoring programmes, well
  -defined protocols of Quality Assurance have to be established to allow
  adequate comparison of results. It is also necessary to include analysis of
  standard reference materials and to obtain detailed knowledge of basal values
  and seasonal variations of the biomarkers in various species, as well as to
  integrate the information obtained with the different biomarkers. Marine
  bivalve molluscs such as mussels are appropriate sentinel species for most of
  the biomarkers proposed except for the induction of the cytochrome P450 system,
  which should be measured in fish, and the degree of imposex, which is a
  biomarker of exposure to TBT specifically measured in certain gastropod
  molluscs. As a result of the workshop, a battery of biomarkers of contaminant
  exposure and effects are proposed that could be incorporated into programmes
  monitoring the quality of the coastal environment in the Iberian Peninsula.
  These measures would be undertaken in conjunction with chemical measures of
  contaminant burdens in selected sentinel species.

AB: Lysosomal responses are widely accepted cellular effect biomarkers of
  general stress. Up to now, these biomarkers have been analysed by means of
  conventional techniques based on enzyme histochemical methods, where lysosomal
  enzymes such as acid phosphatase and beta -glucuronidase ( beta -GUS) have been
  employed as markers of lysosomes. The aim of the present work was to develop
  more advanced and sensitive methods based on the use of polyclonal antibodies
  to measure lysosomal enzymes in different sentinel organisms. For this purpose,
  we have studied the cross-reactivity of two commercial polyclonal antibodies
  against the lysosomal enzymes acid phosphatase and beta -GUS with molluscan
  digestive gland by means of immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. The
  antibody against acid phosphatase cross-reacted specifically with the lysosomal
  fraction of the digestive gland, while unspecific immunoreaction occurred with
  digestive gland whole homogenates and tissue sections. The antibody against
  beta -GUS cross-reacted specifically with digestive gland whole homogenates and
  tissue sections. The cross-reactivity of this antibody was tested also in crab
  hepatopancreas and mullet liver where the same successful results were
  obtained. The second aim of the present study was to test if the immuno-based
  approach was sensitive enough to detect lysosomal alterations provoked by
  contaminants. For this purpose two experiments were carried out with mussels
  treated with cadmium in two ways: in vivo treatment by injection and in vitro
  treatment using digestive gland explants. Afterwards immunoblotting studies
  with the antibody against beta -GUS were applied and immunoreactive bands were
  quantified by means of a gel analysis programme. We found that beta -GUS
  protein levels were higher in treated mussels when compared with controls in
  either in vivo or in vitro treatments. All these data suggest that the
  polyclonal antibody against beta -GUS is adequate to be used in immuno-based
  approaches to detect contaminant-induced lysosomal alterations.

AB: The effects of spatial and temporal differences on the water quality of the
  urban contaminated Reconquista River (Argentina) were evaluated by means of
  bioassays based on the growth of two algal populations (Chlorella pyrenoidosa
  and Scenedesmus acutus). The effects produced by the addition of cadmium and/or
  nutrient salts to the samples were also assayed. Noticeable differences in
  algal biomass were detected among samples from different sites, the highest
  values corresponding to the most polluted zones. The toxic effect of cadmium
  was more pronounced in S. acutus than in C. pyrenoidosa, particularly in the
  least polluted waters. The addition of nutrient salts to the culture medium
  attenuated heavy metal toxicity, mainly to C. pyrenoidosa, and also revealed
  nutrient limitation to algal growth in certain sites and dates. Site
  classifications based both on algal bioassays and on physical and chemical
  variables showed good agreement.

  of chemicals on soil ecosystems in the field. The survival and the growth of
  the snails are influenced by the nature of the biotope and the level of the
  pollutants. Assay of cadmium, copper, lead and zinc bioaccumulated in the
  tissues of the sentinel snails provides information on the bioavailability of
  metals in the environment. The encagement model, little used for terrestrial
  species, can be useful in monitoring (specific and global endpoints) metal
  pollution of the environment in reference to the trophic level of the primary
  consumers. Active biomonitoring is positively compared with the passive
  biomonitoring.

DE: Toxins-; Mycotoxins-; Vomitoxin-; Interleukin-6; Immunoglobulin-A; anorexia

AB: Dietary exposure to the trichothecene vomitoxin (VT) causes feed refusal and
  elevates IgA production in the mouse. Based on the observations that IL-6 can
  cause anorexia and promote IgA production and that gene expression of this
  cytokine is increased in vivo and ex vivo on VT exposure, we hypothesized that
  IL-6 is an essential cytokine in VT-induced feed refusal and IgA dysregulation.
  To test this hypothesis, the effects of dietary VT on feed intake, weight gain,
  serum IgA levels and kidney mesangial IgA deposition in an IL-6-"knockout"
  mouse (B6129-IL6 super(tmi Kopf)) were compared to those in both a
  corresponding "wild-type" (B6129F2) and a previously characterized "sentinel"
  strain (B6C3F1) that possess the intact gene for this cytokine. IL-6 deficiency
  did not alter the capacity of VT to cause feed refusal or impair weight gain.
  VT-fed B6129F2 and B6C3F1 mice had significantly higher serum IgA
  concentrations than did their corresponding controls fed clean diet, whereas
  significant differences were not observed between IL-6 KO mice fed VT or
  control diets. Kidneys taken from VT-fed wild-type and sentinel mice had
  significantly increased mesangial IgA deposition as compared to controls. While
  slight increases in mesangial IgA were observed in VT-fed IL-6 KO mice, mean
  fluorescence intensities were significantly less than that found in the
  corresponding wild-type and sentinel strains. IL-6 KO mice appeared to be less
  prone to the development of microscopic haematuria following VT exposure than
  were the corresponding wild-type and sentinel strains. In total, the results
  suggested that IL-6-deficient mice were refractory to VT-induced dysregulation
  of IgA production and development of IgA nephropathy, whereas chronic VT
  -mediated nutritional effects related to feed intake and weight gain were
  unaffected.

AB: Monogamy is rare among mammals, including marsupials. I studied the social
  organization of the little-known rock-haunting possum in Kakadu National Park
  in Northern Australia. Preliminary field observations revealed that the
  majority of possums live in cohesive groups consisting of a female-male pair
  and young, suggesting a monogamous mating system. I used radiotracking to
  determine home range patterns, and observations to measure the degree of
  symmetry between the sexes in maintaining the pair bond and initiating changes
  in group activity. I also measured the extent of maternal and paternal indirect
  and direct care. Nocturnal observations and radiotelemetric data from 3 years
  showed that six possum groups maintained nonoverlapping home ranges with long
  -term consorts and young sharing dens. Males contributed more than females to
  maintaining the pair bond but they contributed equally to parental care. For
  the first time, the parental behaviours of bridge formation, embracing,
  marshalling of young, sentinel behaviour and tail beating are reported in a
  marsupial. Males participated to a high degree in maintaining relationships
  with one mate and their offspring. Collectively, these results suggest that the
  mating system of this wild population of rock-haunting possums is obligate
  social monogamy.

AB: The aim of this study was to improve the knowledge on the metabolic pathways
  involved in benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) activation and on the relationship between
  adduct levels and enzymatic biomarker activities. With this purpose, a model to
  assess pollutant exposure via food supply has been developed for the sentinel
  organism, Mytilus galloprovincialis. Mussels were fed for 4 weeks with B[a]P
  -contaminated feed (50 mg/kg dry weight mussel). Bioaccumulation was studied by
  determination of B[a]P concentration in whole mussel by GC/MS analysis.
  Different biomarkers of pollutant exposure were measured to assess the
  metabolic state of the exposed organisms. CYP1A-like immunopositive protein
  titration and B[a]P hydroxylase (BPH) activity were assessed as indicators of
  phase I biotransformation. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity was
  measured as an indicator of the conjugation activities. Catalase (CAT) and DT
  -diaphorase (DTD) activities were assessed as potential biomarkers of oxidative
  stress, whereas acetylthiocholine esterase (AChE) activity was measured as an
  indication of possible neurotoxicity of B[a]P exposure. DNA adduct levels were
  determined in digestive gland DNA by applying the super(32)P-postlabeling
  technique with nuclease P1 enhancement. For the developed conditions of
  exposure, B[a]P concentration reached in whole mussel tissues was very high
  (>500 mg/kg d.w. mussel) and significant B[a]P-induced changes were recorded
  for each enzymatic biomarkers. BPH and CAT activities were significantly
  increased by B[a]P exposure, whereas GST in the gills, DTD and AChE were
  significantly depressed. On the other hand, no change in CYP1A-like
  immunopositive protein content was observed. Induction and increase with time
  of bulky B[a]P-related DNA adducts were demonstrated in the digestive gland,
  although at low levels (0.269 plus or minus 0.082 adduct /10e8 dNps at maximum)
  by the super(32)P-postlabeling assay. DNA adduct level was significantly
  correlated with whole mussel tissue B[a]P concentration, so were all the
  enzymatic biomarkers measured except to GST activity in both gill and digestive
  gland tissues. BPH, DTD, CAT and AChE displayed a strong correlation with
  adduct levels. These results demonstrate the neurotoxicity and the genotoxicity
  of B[a]P exposure in the mussel. The induction of bulky DNA adducts in mussels
  demonstrates the existence of activation pathways already identified in
  vertebrates. It validates also the suitability of this model for further
  studies on B[a]P metabolism in mussels. Our results support the proposal of
  BPH, AChE, DTD and CAT activities as suitable biomarkers of PAH exposure for
  these sentinel species.

AB: In 1996, the University of Montana undertook the task of restoring native
  vegetation to a weed-infested Palouse prairie site owned by the University and
  immediately adjacent to campus. The project was mandated as a weed control
  project by the state, due to 1995 legislation requiring creation of weed
  management plans for all state agencies controlling lands within Weed
  Districts. The University, however, regarded the effort as a restoration
  project of considerable importance from both an ecological and a political
  point of view. The grassland, situated on the face of Mt. Sentinel, rises
  dramatically behind the campus and is a well-loved and well-recognized symbol
  of the University of Montana. The area, which covers some 480 acres, is widely
  used both for recreation and as an outdoor laboratory and classroom for the
  University.

  monitoring (EEM) require the industrial sector to examine their receiving
  environments for impacts. The most cited problem during the first cycle was the
  inability to capture sufficient numbers of two sentinel species. For this and
  other reasons we have been examining the use of small forage fish species for
  use in EEM programs. Our studies indicate that it is possible to examine all
  measures of fish health required for the EEM program in forage fish and we have
  also initiated other studies using these fish to examine endocrine disruption
  downstream of other discharges in Canada.

DE: Toxic-materials; Occupational-exposure; Paints-; hexamethylene-diisocyanate
AB: Hexamethylene Diisocyanate (HDI) is a color stable aliphatic isocyanate that
  is used in specialty paints as a hardener. Due to the lower vapor pressure of
  its commercial biuret form, it is considered a relatively "safe" isocyanate
  from an exposure standpoint. This case series reports on an unusual toxic
  exposure to HDI. Between November 1993 and May 1994, seven specialty painters
  and one boiler maker who were working at three different power plants were
  examined at the Institute of Occupational and Environmental Health at West
  Virginia University. At their respective work sites, HDI was applied to the hot
  surfaces of boilers that were not shut down, and allowed sufficient time to
  cool. Consequently, these workers were exposed to volatile HDI and its thermal
  decomposition products. All of these workers underwent a complete physical
  examination, spirometry, and methacholine challenge testing. All 8 workers
  complained of dyspnea, while 4 of the 8 also complained of rash. On examination
  3 workers were methacholine challenge positive and 2 had persistent rash. At
  follow-up 4 years later, 5 workers still had to use inhalation medication and
  one had progressive asthma and dermatitis. All 8 workers, by the time of the
  follow-up, had gone through economic and occupational changes. This case series
  reports on an unusual exposure to HDI. It is unusual in that: 1) There were two
  simultaneous sentinel cases with two different Material Safety Data Sheets
  (MSDS) for the same product, 2) Exposure was to volatile HDI and its
  decomposition products and 3) Hazardous conditions of exposure occurred at
  three different sites.

AB: In the developing world condom use among sex workers and their clients plays
  a dominant role in the transmission of HIV/STD. In Surabaya, Indonesia, data
  from the 1993 STD prevalence survey in female sex workers (brothels, street,
  massage parlours, barber shops, call-girl houses, and nightclubs) reveal that
  only 5% (33/692) of the brothel workers and 14% (25/177) of the street walkers
  had condoms in their possession at the time of the interview. During the last
  paid sexual intercourse, sex workers from the brothels, streets, and nightclubs
  used condoms infrequently (14%, 20%, and 25%, respectively). Sex workers from
  massage parlours, barber shops, and call girls were about 5 to 3 times more
  likely to use condoms than sex workers from nightclubs (adjusted odds ratio of
  3.5, 4.9, and 4.2, respectively); thus condom promotion programmes should be
  targeted at sex workers at brothels, streets, and nightclubs. Programmes should
  include: (1) free distribution of condoms to sex establishments at the initial
  stage, and condom social marketing at later stages; (2) penalties, including
  legal sanctions, against any sex establishments that do not consistently use
  condoms; (3) participation of brothel owners and madams in encouraging sex
  workers to consistently have clients use condoms during sexual intercourse; and
  (4) establishment of sentinel surveillance to monitor STD/HIV and condom-use
  compliance.

AB: The results of an intercalibration exercise among the laboratories
  participating in the MED POL program for monitoring biological effects of
  pollutants along the Mediterranean coasts are presented. Three established
  biomarkers, i.e. lysosomal membrane stability, metallothionein concentration
  and ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity, were intercalibrated. The
  stability of lysosomal membranes in mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis Lam.)
  was assessed with a cytochemical method. The four participating laboratories
  were able to discriminate between control animals (membrane labilization times
  ranging from 21 to 35 min) and Cu-exposed animals (40 micrograms/l Cu for 3
  days) (labilization times ranging from 4.5 to 7.4 min). The metallothionein
  concentration was evaluated in digestive gland homogenates of control mussels
  and of animals exposed to 200 micrograms/l Cd for 7 days. The eight
  participating laboratories were able to discriminate between controls and
  treated samples using a spectrophotometric method. The EROD activity was
  evaluated by 11 laboratories. All laboratories were able to discriminate
  between liver microsomal preparations obtained from control and from benzo-a
  -pyrene exposed fish (Dicentrarchus labrax), with values ranging from 0.5 to
  15.88 pmol/min/mg protein in controls and from 5.41 to 165.13 pmol/min/mg
  protein in treated animals. Using S9 fractions, it was possible to correctly
  identify control and treated fish, with a variation similar to that found using
  microsomal fractions, albeit with an inevitable difference in specific
  activity. As a corollary, all laboratories involved produced comparable data
  and were able to identify pollutant-induced stress syndromes in sentinel
  organisms. Thus, intercalibration enables the use of biomarkers in large
  biomonitoring programs.

AB: Based on reports from the workers' compensation system and a sentinel health
  provider network, latex gloves may be one of the most prevalent sources of
  occupational skin disorders in Washington State's health care industry. To
  gather information to understand and address this problem, questionnaires were
  distributed to 105 acute care hospitals in Washington State. Employee health
  and infection control specialists were queried on their knowledge about latex
  allergy, the perceived extent of the problem, and the actions taken to address
  the problem. With 95 of the hospitals returning completed questionnaires (93%
  response rate), 30% reported having problems with latex allergies among
  employees in their facility, with most reporting two or fewer cases. Adequate
  knowledge was found about the causes and effects of latex allergies, but
  definite knowledge gaps existed. More than 60% of all of the hospitals surveyed
  had made some type of glove alternatives available to affected employees, 4%
  had designated latex free zones, 4% had cleaned to remove latex dust, and 7%
  had done nothing to address the issue.

AB: The widespread use of antibiotics has been responsible for the development
  of numerous problems including the emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria,
  increased number of nosocomial- and community-acquired infections, less than
  optimal patient outcome, and increased health care costs. Of equal concern is
  the emergence of resistance in clinical isolates to antibiotics that were once
  considered "standard" with predictable in vitro susceptibility patterns. Such
  resistance has been especially notable in organisms that are commonly
  encountered in a variety of infections including, Streptococcus pneumoniae,
  Staphylococcus aureus. Enterococci, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia
  coli. It is important for the clinical microbiology laboratory to provide the
  practicing clinician with accurate and timely antimicrobial susceptibility
  information which requires the application of standardized and approved in
  vitro testing methods. The laboratory also serves as a sentinel by maintaining
  an active monitoring and surveillance program in which current in vitro
  susceptibility patterns can be compared with local, regional, and national data
  bases.

RN: 7439-92-1
AB: Children are the most susceptible population to lead exposure because of
  three interacting factors; they have more opportunity for contact with lead
  sources due to their activities, lead absorption occurs more readily in a child
  compared to an adult, and the child's development is more vulnerable to lead
  than adults. Low levels of lead in the blood have been shown to cause adverse
  health effects; the level of concern for children is currently 10 microg/dl.
  The contribution of dietary exposure of lead to increased blood lead levels
  (PbB) is not well characterized. This study was conducted to measure potential
  dietary lead intakes of children 2 to 3 years of age who live in homes
  contaminated with environmental lead. Objectives were to estimate lead intakes
  for children consuming food in contaminated environments, recognizing
  unstructured eating patterns and to investigate if correlations exist between
  daily dietary exposure and measured PbB. Dietary exposure was evaluated by
  collecting samples that were typical of the foods the young children ate in
  their homes. A 24-h duplicate of all foods plus sentinel foods, i.e.,
  individual items used to represent foods contaminated during handling, were
  collected from 48 children. Ten homes were revisited to obtain information on
  the variation in daily dietary intakes. Drinking water was evaluated both as
  part of the segregated beverage sample composite and by itself. Additional
  information collected included lead concentrations from hand wipes, floor
  wipes, and venous blood, and questionnaire responses from the caregiver on
  activities potentially related to exposure. Activities and hygiene practices of
  the children and contamination of foods in their environment influences total
  dietary intake. Estimated mean dietary intakes of lead (29.2 microg Pb/day)
  were more than three times the measured 24-h duplicate-diet levels (8.37 microg
  Pb/day), which were almost six times higher than current national estimates
  (1.40 microg Pb/day). Statistically significant correlations were observed
  between floor wipes and foods contacting contaminated surfaces, hand wipes and
  foods contacting contaminated hands and surfaces, and hand wipes and floor
  wipes. This study indicates that the dietary pathway of exposure to lead is
  impacted by eating activities of children living in lead-contaminated
  environments and that analysis of foods themselves is not enough to determine
  excess dietary exposures that are occurring.

AB: BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) has been a promising new
  technique in breast carcinoma staging, but could be unreliable in certain
  patient subsets. The current study assessed whether age, preoperative
  chemotherapy, tumor size, and/or previous excisional biopsy influenced the
  identification of sentinel nodes (SLNs) or the reliability of a node-negative
  SLND in predicting a node negative axilla. METHODS: Eighty-two patients who had
  clinically negative axillae underwent SLND followed by Level I/II axillary
  lymph node dissection (ALND). SLNDs were performed using both technetium-99m
  (Tc-99m) labeled colloid and isosulfan blue dye. SLNs were analyzed by
  hematoxlyin and eosin and immunocytochemical techniques. RESULTS: SLNs were
  successfully identified in 80% of patients. Mapping success was decreased among
  postmenopausal women but was not influenced by preoperative chemotherapy, large
  tumor size, or previous excisional biopsy. Of the 31 successfully mapped, node
  positive patients, 5 had false negative (FN) SLNDs (overall FN rate = 16%). Of
  the 9 successfully mapped patients who had received preoperative chemotherapy
  and had positive axillary nodes, 3 had FN SLND (FN rate = 33%). The presence of
  clinically positive lymph nodes before chemotherapy did not predict which
  patients would have a subsequent FN SLND. T3 tumor size, but not previous
  excision, was associated significantly with increased FN rate, although the FN
  rate for previous excision was 11%. No FN SLND occurred with T1/T2 tumors that
  were not excised previously and had not received preoperative chemotherapy.
  CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative chemotherapy was associated with an unacceptably high
  FN rate for SLND. While larger tumor size also was associated with FN SLND,
  this effect might have been due to preoperative chemotherapy use in these
  patients. Small sample size precluded determining whether excisional biopsy
  before mapping increased FN SLND rates independently.

AB: This review summarizes the pertinent issues of radiation exposure to the
  developing fetus and the existing imaging techniques available to detect
  neoplastic disease spread of the common malignancies in women of reproductive
  age (breast cancer, cervical carcinoma, Hodgkin's disease, and melanoma). The
  standard radiologic work-up for assessing disease extent is reviewed and the
  pros and cons of these various imaging modalities are discussed with regard to
  the potential deleterious effects on the mother and fetus. Reasonable
  alternatives to the standard protocols for documenting extent of disease for
  these neoplasms are proposed. Usually a pregnant cancer patient can be safely
  and reasonably staged with imaging. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging will most
  often be the procedure of choice because it does not use ionizing radiation.
  Specialized, focused questions such as sentinel lymph node detection may
  require limited exposure to ionizing radiation, which will not expose the fetus
  to a significant dose. While a standard chest x-ray does involve ionizing
  radiation, it does not expose the fetus to significant radiation.

  the epidemic. METHODS: We reviewed nationwide HIV case reports, and we analyzed
  annual seroprevalence among different sentinel populations in 21 provinces,
  using the chi2 test for linear trend to assess trends in HIV prevalence. HIV
  prevention efforts were also reviewed. RESULTS: Through 1999, 17,046 HIV
  infections, including 2947 AIDS cases and 1523 deaths had been reported in
  Vietnam. The cumulative incidence rate for the country was 22.5 per 100,000
  population. Injection drug users (IDUs) represented 89.0% of all those for whom
  risk was reported before 1997 and 88.0% in the period 1997 to 1999. In 1999,
  HIV prevalence rates among IDUs ranged by province from 0% to 89.4%.

AB: Using the golden mutant zebrafish having a decrease in interfering
  pigmentation, we are developing transgenic lines in which DNA motifs that
  respond to selected environmental pollutants are capable of activating a
  reporter gene that can be easily assayed. We have begun with three response
  elements that recognize three important classes of foreign chemicals. Aromatic
  hydrocarbon response elements (AHREs) respond to numerous polycyclic
  hydrocarbons and halogenated coplanar molecules such as 2,3,7,8
  -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD; dioxin) and polychlorinated biphenyls.
  Electrophile response elements (EPREs) respond to quinones and numerous other
  potent electrophilic oxidants. Metal response elements (MREs) respond to heavy
  metal cations such as mercury, copper, nickel, cadmium, and zinc. Soon, we will
  include estrogen response elements (EREs) to detect the effects of
  environmental endocrine disruptors, and retinoic acid response elements (RARE,
  RXRE) to detect the effects of retinoids in the environment. Each of these
  substances is known to be bioconcentrated in fish to varying degrees; for
  example, 10(-17) M TCDD in a body of water becomes concentrated to
  approximately 10(-12) M TCDD in a fish, where it would act upon the AHRE motif
  and turn on the luciferase (LUC) reporter gene. The living fish as a sentinel
  will not only be assayed intact in the luminometer, but--upon several days or
  weeks of depuration--would be usable again. To date, we have established that
  zebrafish transcription factors are able to recognize both mammalian and trout
  AHRE, EPRE, and MRE sequences in a dose-dependent and chemical-class-specific
  manner, and that expression of both the LUC and jellyfish green fluorescent
  protein (GFP) reporter genes is easily detected in zebrafish cell cultures and
  in the intact live zebrafish. Variations in sensitivity of this model system
  can be achieved by increasing the copy number of response elements and perhaps
  by altering the sequence of each core consensus response element and flanking
  regions. This transgenic technology should allow for a simple, exquisitely
  sensitive, and inexpensive assay for monitoring aquatic pollution. We have
  already initiated studies using sentinel zebrafish to monitor a public drinking
  water source.

AB: Sentinel lymph node biopsy has been shown to be an accurate predictor of
  axillary nodal status in invasive breast cancer and is a useful alternative to
  axillary dissection for some patients. Because radioactive materials are often
  used to identify the sentinel lymph node, concerns have been raised regarding
  the safe handling of tissue specimens obtained by this technique. The Surgical
  Pathology Committee of the College of American Pathologists and the Association
  of Directors of Anatomic and Surgical Pathology have developed recommendations
  for the safe handling of radioactive specimens obtained by sentinel

AB: Environmental endocrine disruption in wildlife has primarily focused on
  estrogenic/androgenic end points and their antagonists. We describe here the
  work that has occurred within the Great Lakes of North America that has used
  the bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) as a sentinel species of the effects
  of environmental toxicants, including endocrine disruption. Our data suggests
  that population level effects of hormone disrupting chemicals, not necessarily
  estrogen/androgen mimics and their antagonists, have been associated with
  reproductive and teratogenic effects observed in the bald eagle population
  within the Great Lakes Basin. Additional laboratory and field studies are
  necessary to further clarify the role of environmental endocrine disruptors on
  reproduction in avian populations. The use of sea eagles (Haliaeetus spp.) as
  biosentinels of pollution in other regions of the world is also discussed.

AB: PURPOSE: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has proved to be an accurate
  method for detecting nodal micrometastases in previously untreated patients
  with early-stage breast cancer. We investigated the accuracy of this technique
  for patients with more advanced breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
  PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with stage II or III breast cancer who had
  undergone doxorubicin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy before breast surgery were
  eligible. Intraoperative lymphatic mapping was performed with peritumoral
  injections of blue dye alone or in combination with technetium-labeled sulfur
  colloid. All patients were offered axillary lymph node dissection. Negative
  sentinel and axillary nodes were subjected to additional processing with serial
  step sectioning and immunohistochemical staining with an anticytokeratin
  antibody to detect micrometastases. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients underwent SLN
  biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy from 1994 to 1999. The SLN identification
  rate improved from 64.7% to 94.1%. Twenty-two (51.2%) of the 43 successfully
  mapped patients had positive SLNs, and in 10 of those 22 patients (45.5%), the
  SLN was the only positive node. Three patients had false-negative SLN biopsy;
  that is, the sentinel node was negative, but at least one nonsentinel node
  contained metastases. Additional processing revealed occult micrometastases in
  four patients (three in sentinel nodes and one in a nonsentinel node).
  CONCLUSION: SLN biopsy is accurate after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The SLN
  identification improved with experience. False-negative findings occurred at a
  low rate throughout the series. This technique is a potential way to guide the
  axillary treatment of patients who are clinically node negative after
  neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

AB: Nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) terrorism countermeasures are a major
  priority with municipalities, healthcare providers, and the federal government.
  Significant resources are being invested to enhance civilian domestic
  preparedness by conducting education at every response level in anticipation of
  a NBC terroristic incident. The key to a successful response, in addition to
  education, is integration of efforts as well as thorough communication and
  understanding the role that each agency would play in an actual or impending
  NBC incident. In anticipation of a NBC event, a regional counter-terrorism task
  force was established to identify resources, establish responsibilities and
  coordinate the response to NBC terrorism. Members of the task force included
  first responders, hazmat, law enforcement (local, regional, national),
  government officials, the health department, and the regional poison
  information center. Response protocols were developed and education was
  conducted, culminating in all members of the response task force becoming
  certified NBC instructors. The poison center participated actively in 3
  incidents of suspected biologic and chemical terrorism: an alleged anthrax
  -contaminated letter sent to a women's health clinic; a possible sarin gas
  release in a high school: and a potential anthrax/ebola contamination incident
  at an international airport. All incidents were determined hoaxes. The regional
  response plan establishes the poison information center as a common repository
  for all cases in a biological or chemical incident. The poison center is one of
  several critical components of a regional counterterrorism response force. It
  can conduct active and passive toxicosurveillance and identify sentinel events.
  To be responsive, the poison center staff must be knowledgeable about
  biological and chemical agents. The development of basic protocols and a
  standardized staff education program is essential. The use of the RaPiD-T (R
  -recognition, P-protection, D-detection, T-triage/treatment) course can provide
  basic staff education for responding to this important but rare consultation to
  the poison center.

AB: The data on the study of the spread of HIV infection among injecting drug
  users in St. Petersburg, carried out by the method of the random testing of
  blood remaining in used syringes, are presented. Injecting drug users visiting
  buses working in accordance with the program "Buses for Assistance to Drug
  Addicts" were chosen as a study group. The exchange of syringes was one of the
  elements of this program. The work was carried out in two areas with a high
  concentration of drug users. The eluates from syringes used by 300 persons were
  studied. The average rate of the spread of HIV in the cohort under study was
  12%. The results were indicative of a high degree of the spread of HIV among
  injecting drug users in St. Petersburg. Epidemiological patrol surveillance
  proved to be an effective method for the evaluation of the epidemiological
  situation in a highly inaccessible group of the population.

AB: The rapid incidence rise of cutaneous melanoma resulted in an increasing
  interest in this particular tumor. During the last years public prevention
  campaigns enlarged the awareness of melanoma, subsequently as a direct effect
  the mean tumor thickness of melanoma, the most predictable prognostic factor,
  decreased. Moreover, the biology of melanoma initiation and metastasis has been
  studied extensively with special interest in molecular biology. Controlled
  clinical studies answered several critical questions in respect to the standard
  care of surgery in melanoma. Yet, the guidelines for the surgical treatment of
  head and neck melanoma are in accordance to that of other localisations with
  reduced safety margins around the primary tumor. Elective (prophylactic) lymph
  node dissection (ELND) of regional lymph nodes is no more considered as a
  standard tool. Moreover, ELND has been given up by most melanoma centers, since
  it is known that prospective-randomized trials were not able to demonstrate an
  increase of overall survival for patients with ELND compared with untreated
  patients. Instead of this potentially aggressive treatment modality the
  examination of the first draining regional lymph node, sentinel node biopsy
  (SNB), has been introduced some years ago. Recently, a large clinical trial
  demonstrated that the SNB status reflects the most valuable prognostic factor
  for primary melanoma known so far. First studies in head and neck melanoma
  figured out that this technique is more complex in this special localisation,
  but produced comparable results. Systemic adjuvant (prophylactic) therapy of
  high-risk melanoma should preferentially be applied within controlled clinical
  trials. Most attractive candidates for an effective treatment are interferons.
  Several studies ruled out that interferon alpha-treated melanoma patients
  demonstrate an extended disease-free survival. Adjuvant chemotherapy has not
  shown a clinically relevant benefit. Thus, patients should preferentially be
  treated within controlled clinical trials.

AB: BACKGROUND: Sewage treatments are not efficient to eliminate enteric
  microorganisms. Viruses are able to persist and are discharged into the marine
  environment with treated effluents. Few data are now available on the magnitude
  and the contributive processes of marine viral contamination. This work
  evaluates the relationship between the magnitude of rainfall and the viral
  contamination of the marine environment during winter epidemics of
  gastroenteritis in human coastal populations. METHODS: A RT-PCR method was used
  to detect enterovirus, hepatitis A virus, Norwalk-like virus, astrovirus and
  rotavirus in shellfish, harvested monthly between August 1995 and July 1998.
  The frequency of virus detection in shellfish was expressed as an Index of
  Viral Contamination. Acute gastroenteritis in the population was estimated
  using the French Sentinel System for Monitoring of Communicable Diseases.
  Rainfall effects on the efficiency of sewage treatment were assessed using an
  estimated staying time of sewage effluents in the plant. RESULTS: The results
  indicate that the highest viral contamination occurs in winter. Maximal indexes
  of viral contamination were respectively 70% in January 1996, 100% in January
  1997, but only 31% in January 1998. Viral contamination variations seemed to
  follow the pattern of the winter epidemic of acute gastroenteritis in the local
  population in 1996 and 1997. These observations should be linked to the winter
  rainfalls. Heavy rains on short periods of time could create an hydraulic
  overload in the sewage treatment plant, reducing the staying time of the sewage
  effluents and thus the efficiency of the disinfection process. CONCLUSION: The
  magnitude of the viral contamination of shellfish seems to result from the
  simultaneity between the winter epidemics of acute gastroenteritis in the
  coastal population and heavy rainfall. To prevent public health hazards
  associated with shellfish consumption, the monitoring of microbiological
  quality in shellfish harvesting areas should include accompagning survey of
  viral epidemic in the coastal population, and of sewage outputs in the coastal
  environment.

AB: The aim of this study was to estimate the radioactive risk for surgical
  staff performing radioguided sentinel lymph node (SN) biopsy and to calculate
  the contamination level in the operating room for assessment of the possible
  need for specific radiation protection procedures. We studied 20 patients who
  were selected for quadrantectomy and SN biopsy. The day before surgery a volume
  of 0.15 mL of 99mTc-nanocoll was injected: the activity was 3.11 +/- 0.85 MBq
  in group A (15 pts) and 11.6 +/- 0.6 MBq in group B (5 pts). External radiation
  to staff was evaluated by measuring the exposure rate in air one hour after
  radiopharmaceutical administration. The air KERMA rate during surgery was
  estimated considering the physical decay of 99mTc. Contamination of disposable
  materials and surgical instruments in the operating room was measured using a
  contamination monitor, whereas the residual activity in the SN and the
  injection site was measured with a gamma probe. The exposure rate at 20 cm from
  the injection site was 0.75 microSv/h when the most radioactive patients (group
  B) were treated. Contamination in the operating room proved to be negligible.
  Considering the number of radioguided treatments carried out by a surgeon in
  one year, an equivalent effective dose of 0.075 mSv was estimated; the
  recommended dose limit according to the relevant Italian law, DL 230/95, is 1
  mSv/yr. Surgical staff therefore do not require a classification of "exposed
  workers" and there is no need to supply the operating room with special
  containers for radioactive waste.

AB: OBJECTIVES: Several investigators argue that company wide mortalities for
  recent workers allow early identification of potential workplace hazards.
  Mortalities for recent workers were compared with published studies of workers
  with specific exposures in the same company to find whether mortality
  surveillance results could be used to identify previously unknown health
  effects from workplace hazards. METHODS: Relative risks for causes of death in
  published substance specific studies at the plants were compared with the
  relative risks in the mortality surveillance of workers 20 or more years after
  first being employed. RESULTS: As reported by other companies, low mortalities
  were found among workers in the mortality surveillance. The mortality
  surveillance reports often found no increased risk of disease at plants in
  which substance specific studies had found no effects. However, disease
  specific relative risks were not found by the mortality surveillance
  predictions of relative risks in the substance specific studies with increased
  risk. CONCLUSION: Mortality surveillance is of limited use for identifying
  health effects from past workplace exposures to specific materials. The healthy
  worker and survivor effects, the failure to identify subsets of workers exposed
  to potentially toxic substances, the typically long induction period between
  exposure and disease, and the inability of recent mortality levels to reflect
  historical conditions all may make it difficult to use mortality surveillance
  to identify workplace hazards. Combining mortality surveillance with studies of
  workers with potentially toxic exposures helps identify occupational hazards.

AB: BACKGROUND: To describe the trend in the number of HIV-infected persons and
  the number of AIDS cases in Spain between 1980 and 1998. SUBJECTS AND METHODS:
  The following information was used: annual incidence of AIDS taken from the
  National Registry, AIDS deaths taken from the same registry and from the
  Registry of Vital Statistics, HIV seroprevalence in studies in sentinel
  populations, HIV incidence in cohorts of exposed persons, and reports of HIV
  infections in the registries existing in the autonomous communities. We
  considered three events of interest--HIV infection, AIDS and death--which were
  related using back-projection and compartmental models. RESULTS: HIV spread
  rapidly in Spain during the years 1980. Transmission subsequently declined by
  more than 50% to figures that probably do not exceed 6,000 new infections in
  1998. The incidence of AIDS increased to more than 7,000 new cases in 1994 and
  has since declined to some 4,000 cases in 1998. The level of AIDS mortality has
  always been lower than the incidence; it increased up to 1995 and then dropped
  to less than half in subsequent years. The number of living persons infected
  with HIV, including AIDS cases, arose until the early years 1990 and has since
  remained steady at about 125,000 persons. The number of cases of living persons
  with AIDS has increased continuously, and is estimated at about 19,000 through
  the end of 1998. CONCLUSIONS: The recent trend in new infections, AIDS cases
  and deaths is favourable, while the number of infected living persons remains
  very high.

AB: Some of the most debilitating morbidity after surgery and radiotherapy for
  breast cancer is related to treatment of the axilla. This includes persistent
  arm lymphoedema, impaired shoulder mobility and brachial plexopathy.
  Considerable research efforts have been carried out on the radiation
  pathogenesis and the clinical radiobiology of these clinical endpoints, which
  has enabled their severity and incidence to be minimized. It is clear that the
  radiation dose-response relationships for these late endpoints are very steep.
  In other words, even small changes in the exact dose fractionation and physical
  dose distribution can cause major changes in toxicity. In particular, in many
  treatment schedules dose fractions larger than 2 Gy have been used without a
  sufficient reduction in total dose to avoid increased late effects. This is
  important, as much of the available literature reports side effects after
  suboptimal dose-fractionation schedules and inferior radiotherapy techniques.
  Such reports are not representative of what can be achieved using modern
  radiotherapy. An interesting parallelism to the problems encountered in
  reviewing historical experience is found in the British breast litigation, the
  current status of which is presented in this article. Furthermore, morbidity
  after radiotherapy is strongly influenced by concomitant surgery and/or
  chemotherapy, and this should be allowed for when designing the overall
  treatment. Apart from other therapeutic modalities, it has been suggested that
  other exogenous factors have an influence on the risk of radiotherapy-related
  morbidity. However, patients' age and, in the case of lymphoedema, also obesity
  are the only factors that have been established with some certainty. Routine
  adjustment of radiotherapy dose in these cases is not recommended. Two current
  developments may strengthen the role of radiotherapy in the treatment of breast
  cancer. Sentinel node biopsy may allow nodal staging without major surgical
  excision of axillary nodes and this opens the possibility for a more optimal
  combination of radiotherapy and surgery in the management of the axilla. With
  more cancers now being detected by systematic screening programmes, this will
  also increase the possibilities for conservative management, which in most
  cases involves radiotherapy. In conclusion, the improved understanding of the
  clinical radiobiology of late sequelae after radiotherapy allows treatment
  schedules and techniques to be devised that are therapeutically effective while
  maintaining a minimal risk of serious, late morbidity.

AB: We conducted a community-randomized controlled trial in Pakistan to
  determine the efficacy of indoor residual spraying with alphacypermethrin
  ('Fendona', Cyanamid, NJ, USA), applied at 25 mg/m2, to prevent falciparum and
  vivax malaria. Wettable powder (WP) and suspension concentrate (SC)
  formulations were tested against an unsprayed control in an irrigated rice
  -growing area of Sheikhupura district, Punjab province. The study area of 180
  km2 was divided into nine sectors, which were assigned at random to control,
  WP, or SC treatments in replicates of 3. Sentinel villages were selected from
  each sector for entomological and disease monitoring. Malaria was monitored by
  fortnightly active case detection (ACD) and by cross- sectional parasite
  surveys on schoolchildren. Mosquito populations were monitored by space
  spraying of rooms and by cattle-landing catches. The spray campaign took place
  in June 1997 and covered 96% of compounds. During the 7 months after spraying,
  the incidence of falciparum malaria was 95% lower and that of vivax malaria 80%
  lower in WP-sprayed than unsprayed sectors. Similar results were obtained for
  sectors sprayed with the SC formulation. Cross-sectional surveys gave estimates
  of efficacy comparable to those obtained by ACD. Anopheles culicifacies was 80%
  less abundant and A.stephensi, the predominant anopheline, was up to 68% less
  abundant in sprayed areas over the 7-month period. Reductions in anopheline
  parous rates indicated that the single-spray treatment was effective for the
  entire transmission season. Sprayed surfaces lacked odour, which contributed to
  the popularity of the campaign. Alphacypermethrin is a promising insecticide
  for the control of malaria in Pakistan and South Asia generally.

AB: A small scale transmission experiment was performed with bovine herpesvirus
  1 (BHV1) in a cattle population under field conditions. 10 calves were housed
  under strict hygienic conditions, with a distance of 4m between each calf. Five
  calves were experimentally infected with BHV1, two calves with strain Harberink
  and three with strain Lam, respectively. Experimentally infected calves were
  placed at 4 m distance from five susceptible sentinel calves. Airborne
  transmission to sentinel calves was detected using virus isolation and BHV1
  specific polymerase chain reactions in samples of nasal fluids, and BHV1
  specific antibodies in serum samples. Strain Harberink was hardly transmitted
  to sentinel calves, whereas strain Lam was transmitted to all sentinels.
  Estimating the rate of transmission per day, the total number of calves
  infected by one (strain Lam) infected calf was 1.18.Comparing this estimated
  transmission ratio between cattle at a distance of 4 m to the estimated
  transmission ratio R of BHV1 in susceptible commingled cattle reported before,
  the effect of the factor distance on the transmission ratio could be
  calculated. Extrapolating these results, a distance of 4.4 m between cattle
  populations would be necessary to reduce transmission for this strain to R

AB: Controversy exists concerning the health risks from exposures to
  radiofrequency/microwave irradiation (RF/MW). The authors report exposure
  -effect relationships in sentinel patients and their co-workers, who were
  technicians with high levels of exposure to RF/MW radiation. Information about
  exposures of patients with sentinel tumors was obtained from interviews,
  medical records, and technical sources. One patient was a member of a cohort of
  25 workers with six tumors. The authors estimated relative risks for cancer in
  this group and latency periods for a larger group of self-reported individuals.
  Index patients with melanoma of the eye, testicular cancer, nasopharyngioma,
  non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and breast cancer were in the 20-37-year age group.
  Information about work conditions suggested prolonged exposures to high levels
  of RF/MW radiation that produced risks for the entire body. Clusters involved
  many different types of tumors. Latency periods were extremely brief in index
  patients and a larger self-reported group. The findings suggest that young
  persons exposed to high levels of RF/MW radiation for long periods in settings
  where preventive measures were lax were at increased risk for cancer. Very
  short latency periods suggest high risks from high-level exposures.
  Calculations derived from a linear model of dose-response suggest the need to
  prevent exposures in the range of 10-100 microw/cm(2).

AB: Dietary exposure to the trichothecene vomitoxin (VT) causes feed refusal and
  elevates IgA production in the mouse. Based on the observations that IL-6 can
  cause anorexia and promote IgA production and that gene expression of this
  cytokine is increased in vivo and ex vivo on VT exposure, we hypothesized that
  IL-6 is an essential cytokine in VT-induced feed refusal and IgA dysregulation.
  To test this hypothesis, the effects of dietary VT on feed intake, weight gain,
  serum IgA levels and kidney mesangial IgA deposition in an IL-6-"knockout"
  mouse (B6129-IL6(tmi Kopf)) were compared to those in both a corresponding
  "wildtype" (B6129F2) and a previously characterized "sentinel" strain (B6C3F1)
  that possess the intact gene for this cytokine. IL-6 deficiency did not alter
  the capacity of VT to cause feed refusal or impair weight gain. VT-fed B6129F2
  and B6C3F1 mice had significantly higher serum IgA concentrations than did
  their corresponding controls fed clean diet, whereas significant differences
  were not observed between IL-6 KO mice fed VT or control diets. Kidneys taken
  from VT-fed wild-type and sentinel mice had significantly increased mesangial
  IgA deposition as compared to controls. While slight increases in mesangial IgA
  were observed in VT-fed IL-6 KO mice, mean fluorescence intensities were
  significantly less than that found in the corresponding wild-type and sentinel
  strains. IL-6 KO mice appeared to be less prone to the development of
  microscopic haematuria following VT exposure than were the corresponding wild
  -type and sentinel strains. In total, the results suggested that IL-6-deficient
  mice were refractory to VT-induced dysregulation of IgA production and
  development of IgA nephropathy, whereas chronic VT-mediated nutritional effects
  related to feed intake and weight gain were unaffected.

AB: BACKGROUND: Routine axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for elderly women
  with invasive breast cancer has been questioned because it rarely alters
  therapy yet carries a significant morbidity rate. Sentinel lymphadenectomy
  (SLND) improves axillary staging and alters therapy in women with T1 breast
  cancer, but it is not clear whether SLND alters therapy in elderly women with
  breast cancer. METHODS: A prospective breast cancer data base was used to
  identify women 70 years old and older who underwent SLND for axillary staging
  of invasive breast cancer between 1991 and 1998. RESULTS: There were 75
  invasive breast cancers in 73 women. The mean patient age was 74.5 years
  (range, 70-90 years). Median tumor size was 1.4 cm (range, 0.1-6.2 cm). Of the
  75 tumors, 42 (56%) had favorable primary characteristics; the remaining tumors
  had unfavorable characteristics. SLND was performed alone in 17 cases (23%) and
  was followed by completion ALND in 58 cases (77%). Positive lymph nodes were
  identified in 32 cases (43%); 26 (81.3%) were detected by hematoxylin and eosin
  stains, and 6 (18.7%) were detected by immunohistochemistry alone. Five
  patients (6.9%) received adjuvant chemotherapy. Seven patients (9.6%) received
  axillary/supraclavicular radiation for positive nodes. Ten (13.7%) of 73
  patients had obvious alterations in therapy because of axillary nodal status.
  As a result of SLND, 3 (13.6%) of 22 patients with tumors 1.0 cm or smaller
  received tamoxifen, and 7 (15%) of 46 patients with tumors between 1.0 and 3.0
  cm in size had changes in therapy. When patient and tumor characteristics were
  analyzed to determine relationships to therapeutic decision-making, nodal
  status was the variable most significantly associated with changes in therapy
  (P = .0001). CONCLUSIONS: SLND improves axillary staging in elderly women with
  invasive breast cancer. Results of immunohistochemistry do not alter therapy in
  this group of individuals (P = .6367). In patients with small primary tumors,
  SLND alters therapy by increasing the number of patients receiving tamoxifen.
  In addition, SLND affects adjuvant systemic chemotherapy and regional
  radiotherapy in a significant number of patients with larger tumors,
  particularly tumors between 1.0 and 3.0 cm.

AB: Rapid progress has been made recently in our understanding of the
  pathogenesis of coagulation activation in malignancy and mechanisms by which
  the coagulation mechanism may control malignant growth. Idiopathic
  thromboembolic disease may be the sentinel presentation in patients
  subsequently diagnosed with malignancy. Thrombosis complicating the course of
  malignancy may be notoriously difficult to treat, but the introduction of the
  low-molecular-weight heparins has greatly improved management and may obviate
  the need for invasive approaches, such as the use of inferior vena cava
  filters, in many cases. Tantalizing clues from clinical trials of anticoagulant
  therapy in cancer have suggested that components of coagulation pathways may
  support tumor growth. Many of these can be intercepted using drugs that are
  well known and non-toxic. The importance of performing high-quality controlled
  clinical trials that build on past studies and on data from basic research
  cannot be overemphasized.

AB: BACKGROUND: Controversy still exists about standard management of a primary
  melanoma. Over the last decades randomized phase III trials have addressed
  questions about the width of margin in relation to the Breslow thickness of the
  primary lesion, the role of prophylactic isolated limb perfusion, and the role
  of elective lymph node dissection. Overall these trials have demonstrated that
  less extensive surgery is as good as more extensive surgery. Wide excision
  margins, prophylactic isolated limb perfusions, or the elective lymph node
  dissection did not improve overall survival significantly in any of the phase
  III trials conducted. ADJUVANT THERAPY IN HIGH RISK MELANOMA: No standard
  systemic adjuvant therapy with confirmed impact on overall survival has been
  identified thus far for clinically node negative stage I-II (TxN0M0) patients
  after excision of the primary, nor for clinically node positive stage III (TxN1
  -2M0) patients after lymph node dissection for metastatic regional node
  involvement. Poor Staging in the Past. One of the main problems associated with
  the trials assessing systemic adjuvant treatments in management of high risk
  primary melanoma is the fact that in general patients were poorly staged. About
  25%-30% of patients with primaries thicker than 1.5 mm have micro-metastatic
  disease in the regional lymph nodes and beyond. This population was usually
  submerged by the other 70%-75% of the patients with excellent prognosis,
  obscuring the potential benefit of the adjuvant surgical procedure (ELND) or a
  systemic adjuvant treatment. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE MAPPING: Sentinel lymph node
  (SLN) mapping is resolving many of the inadequacies of the past and has
  completely changed the management of primary melanoma. As a small procedure
  with low morbidity it identifies that part of the population which has
  microscopic involvement of regional lymph nodes with greater precision than an
  elective lymph node dissection. SLN-mapping allows for a detailed
  histopathologic evaluation involving multiple sections, H&E staining in
  combination with IHC (immunohistochemical staining) of the node with the
  highest chance of containing metastatic foci. Moreover in the near future it is
  most likely that RT-PCR on negative nodes will complete the diagnostic workup
  as a promising last step in the procedure to determine whether tumor cells are
  present in the sentinel node. Sentinel lymph node status has been shown
  recently to be by far the strongest independent prognostic factor of melanoma
  stage I-II patients. SLN-status is a much stronger prognostic factor than tumor
  thickness, which looses its prognostic relevance in SLN-positive patients.
  CONSEQUENCES FOR DEVELOPMENT AND/OR ALLOCATION OF ADJUVANT THERAPY: Thus we now
  have a procedure by which the melanoma stage I-II population can be dissected
  in a group at truly high risk for recurrence and a group with truly low risk of
  recurrence. The high risk group with a greater than 75% chance for systemic
  disease can then be selected for trial participation of various systemic
  adjuvant therapy regimens that may be allowed to be toxic, considering the very
  high risk for relapse in these patients. The node negative group of patients
  can be selected for participation in trials evaluating systemic adjuvant
  treatment of low toxicity considering the low chance for distant metastatic
  disease.

AB: BACKGROUND: Selective sentinel lymph node (SLN) dissection can spare about
  80% of patients with primary melanoma from radical lymph node dissection. This
  procedure identifies the SLN either visually by injecting isosulfan blue dye
  around the primary melanoma site or by handheld gamma probe after radiocolloid
  injection. METHODS: During selective SLN mapping, 1 to 5 ml of isosulfan blue
  was injected intradermally around the primary melanoma. From November 1993, to
  August 1998, 406 patients underwent intraoperative lymphatic mapping with the
  use of both isosulfan blue and radiocolloid injection. Three cases of selective
  SLN dissection, in which adverse reactions to isosulfan blue occurred, were
  reviewed. RESULTS: We report three cases of anaphylaxis after intradermal
  injection with isosulfan blue of 406 patients who underwent intraoperative
  lymphatic mapping by using the procedure as described above. The three cases we
  report vary in severity from treatable hypotension with urticaria and erythema
  to severe cardiovascular collapse with or without bronchospasm or urticaria.
  CONCLUSIONS: In our series, the incidence of anaphylaxis to isosulfan blue was
  approximately 1%. Anaphylaxis can be fatal if not recognized and treated
  rapidly. Operating room personnel who participate in intraoperative lymphatic
  mapping where isosulfan blue is used must be aware of the potential
  consequences and be prepared to treat anaphylaxis.

AB: In the course of a cohort study, 2275 hair-dressing apprentices were
  examined a median of 6 weeks after the start of their training in the years
  1992. 1993 and 1994. Skin changes were noted in 821 (36%). The site most often
  affected was the interdigital web space (664 of those with skin changes: 81%).
  The proportion of participants with a high atopy score and previous hand and
  flexural dermatitis was larger in the subset with interdigital dermatitis than
  in healthy persons, but was particularly elevated in those affected by
  dermatitis involving other sites. Interdigital dermatitis can be regarded as a
  potential precursor of more severe hand dermatitis in hairdressers, and
  probably of irritant hand dermatitis in wet work occupations in general. Thus,
  it is an important sentinel for secondary prevention. e.g. regular and thorough
  application of emollients.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To monitor trends in HIV seroprevalence among sentinel
  populations of patients with new sexually transmitted disease episodes in 17
  networks of 15 European countries. METHODS: Time trends were estimated by
  logistic regression for homo-/bisexual men, injecting drug users (IDU) and non
  -IDU heterosexuals. The networks were included as independent variables to
  account for different prevalence levels across Europe. Socio-demographic and
  behavioural data were also included in the model. The interactions of time and
  each factor in the model were evaluated to determine whether trends differed
  across networks or population subgroups. RESULTS: Overall, more than 150,000
  sexually transmitted disease episodes were registered in this study. In the
  European network as a whole, the prevalence decreased significantly among IDU
  [n = 2619; odds ratio (OR) for annual change, 0.86; 95% confidence interval
  (CI), 0.80-0.93]. It also decreased among homo-/bisexual men (n = 11,809; OR,
  0.92; 95% CI, 0.89-0.94). In both groups, trends did not differ statistically
  between networks. Among non-IDU heterosexuals (n = 114,024) the prevalence
  increased significantly (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.04-1.13), especially among women
  (OR, 1.13) and the time trends differed statistically across networks. A
  significant increase was observed in four networks, whereas no specific change
  was detected in the others. CONCLUSIONS: By applying a standardized protocol,
  trends in HIV prevalence could be compared across networks and estimated at a
  more global level. For the validity of HIV trends in such surveys, it is
  essential to minimize the number of patients not being tested in networks where
  voluntary testing is required.

AB: In 1997, the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Program (FoodNet)
  conducted active surveillance for culture-confirmed cases of Campylobacter,
  Escherichia coli O157, Listeria, Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio, Yersinia,
  Cyclospora, and Cryptosporidium in five Emerging Infections Program sites.
  FoodNet is a collaborative effort of the Centers for Disease Control and
  Prevention's National Center for Infectious Diseases, the United States
  Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service, the Food and
  Drug Administration's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, and state
  health departments in California, Connecticut, Georgia, Minnesota, and Oregon.
  The population under active surveillance for foodborne infections was
  approximately 16.1 million persons or roughly 6% of the United States
  Population. Through weekly or monthly contact with all clinical laboratories in
  these sites, 8,576 total isolations were recorded: 2,205 cases of
  salmonellosis, 1,273 cases of shigellosis, 468 cases of cryptosporidiosis, 340
  of E. coli O157:H7 infections, 139 of yersiniosis, 77 of listeriosis, 51 of
  Vibrio infections, and 49 of cyclosporiasis. Results from 1997 demonstrate that
  while there are regional and seasonal differences in reported incidence rates
  of certain bacterial and parasitic diseases, and that some pathogens showed a
  change in incidence from 1996, the overall incidence of illness caused by
  pathogens under surveillance was stable. More data over more years are needed
  to assess if observed variations in incidence reflect yearly fluctuations or
  true changes in the burden of foodborne illness.

AB: Nonhuman organisms are being exposed to ionizing radiations at radionuclide
  -contaminated sites around the world. Direct methods are seldom available for
  measuring biologically relevant doses received by these organisms. Here we
  extend biological dosimetry techniques, which are much better developed for
  humans and a few other mammalian species, to a nonmammalian species. Turtles
  were chosen because a long-lived animal would best serve the need for low
  -level, chronic exposure conditions. We chose the yellow-bellied slider turtle
  (Trachemys scripta), which is known to have a maximum life span of at least 22
  years. As reported elsewhere, we first isolated an embryonic fibroblast cell
  line and constructed whole-chromosome-specific DNA libraries for chromosome 1
  by microdissection and PCR. A FISH painting probe was prepared and used to
  establish a dose-response curve for ionizing radiation-induced chromosome
  interchange aberrations in turtle fibroblasts. This was compared to the dose
  response for human fibroblasts treated under similar conditions in our
  laboratory. With respect to induction of chromosome interchange aberrations,
  human fibroblasts were approximately 1.7 times more sensitive than the T.
  scripta fibroblasts. To the extent that symmetrical interchanges are persistent
  over long periods, this approach could eventually provide a measure of the
  integrated lifetime dose these organisms receive from radionuclides in their
  environment and give a measure of the extent of relevant genetic damage over
  that time.

AB: Many publications attest to the potential of the sentinel lymph node
  technique in advancing the clinical management of melanoma and, more recently,
  breast cancer. Whilst not yet universally regarded as the standard of care, the
  technique is gaining wide acceptance. Use of a radiolabelled colloidal tracer
  is central to optimising sensitivity, and this brings with it the need to
  address radiation safety issues relating to the use of radioactive materials in
  the operating theatre and pathology laboratory, and the generation of
  radioactive waste. The radiation dose to the patient should also be determined
  if the professional is to reassure the patient by placing this in its proper
  context. For the purpose of this investigation, biodistribution data were
  obtained from patient studies to quantify the migration of tracer beyond the
  injection site, thereby permitting a detailed assessment of the internal
  dosimetry of the tracer and the resulting radiation dose to the patient. Uptake
  of tracer in the sentinel nodes, reticulo-endothelial system and circulating
  blood was investigated. The radiation dose to surgical staff was recorded using
  whole-body monitors and extremity dosimeters worn at the fingers. Clinical
  waste in the operating theatre was monitored and the radioactive content of
  significantly contaminated items determined. The radiation dose to pathology
  staff was estimated from knowledge of the radioactive content of the specimens
  obtained and a study of work practices. Migration of tracer was found to be
  minimal, with greater than 95% retention at the injection site. The effective
  dose resulting to the patient was 2.1x10(-2) mSv/MBq, with a mean breast dose
  of 7.2x10(-1) mGy/MBq. A mean whole-body dose of 0.34 microSv was received by
  surgical staff per procedure, with a mean finger dose of 0.09 mSv (90 microSv).
  Radiation doses received by pathology staff will be predominantly below
  measurable levels and are likely to be negligible unless primary specimens from
  a large number of studies are analysed promptly upon their excision. At
  operation, surgical swabs can become significantly contaminated and have been
  found to contain up to 22% of the administered activity, dependent upon the
  surgical procedure performed. It is concluded that moderate activities of
  technetium-99m labelled tracer are administered to the patient, and the
  radiation risk to the patient is consequently low relative to that from many
  other medical exposures. The radiation doses to staff groups involved in all
  aspects of the technique are low, and under normal circumstances and levels of
  workload, routine radiation monitoring will not be required. Standard biohazard
  precautions prevent direct intake of radioactive contamination. Radioactive
  waste is created in the operating theatre, and may be generated in the
  pathology laboratory if specimens are not routinely stored until fully decayed.
  This will require special handling if the disposal of radioactive material is
  not permitted.

AB: Fish morbidity and mortality events in Chesapeake Bay tributaries have
  aroused concern over the health of this important aquatic ecosystem. We applied
  a recently described method for quantifying mRNA of an immunosuppressive
  cytokine, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), by reverse transcription
  quantitative-competitive polymerase chain reaction to a field study of fish
  health in the Chesapeake Basin, and compared the results to those of a
  traditional cellular immunoassay macrophage bactericidal activity. We selected
  the white perch (Morone americana) as the sentinel fish species because of its
  abundance at all of the collection sites. White perch were sampled from
  Chesapeake Bay tributaries in June, August, and October 1998. Splenic
  mononuclear cell TGF-beta mRNA levels increased and anterior kidney macrophage
  bactericidal activity decreased, particularly in eastern shore tributaries,
  from June to August and October. The results of the two assays correlated
  inversely (Kendall's [Tau] b = -0.600; p = 0.0102). The results indicated both
  temporal and spatial modulation of white perch immune systems in the Chesapeake
  Basin, and demonstrated the utility of quantitative PCR for TGF-beta as a
  molecular biomarker for field assessment of teleost fish immune status.

AB: Environmental epidemiology is the specialized aspect of public health
  science that studies human health risk from environmental hazards. It is rises
  largely upon a foundation of public health surveillance, and relies heavily
  upon analyses of data for small areas and sparse population groups. To a
  degree, environmental epidemiology is assigned the role of discerning very
  subtle human health impacts, or discerning early evidence of a tragic sequence.
  In that context, environmental epidemiology has a substantial public education
  and risk communication role. Environmental epidemiology will be greatly
  advanced as effective biological markers of exposure and precursor health
  effects are developed. At this point in time, statistical methods are in place
  to monitor population-level disease rates in high-risk populations for early
  risk identification and sentinel event recognition. Advances in geographic
  methods have provided a boon to the discipline by advantaging spatial studies.
  These advances in the discipline still need further refinement and pilot
  experiences. The inclusion of environmental epidemiological considerations with
  instances of proposed industrial expansion, hazardous waste management, and
  contamination remediation is heartily recommended.

AB: Antimicrobial resistance is a problem in modern public health and
  antimicrobial use and especially misuse, the most important selecting force for
  bacterial antibiotic resistance. As this resistance must be monitored we have
  designed the Spanish network 'Red de Vigilancia de Resistencias Antibioticas en
  Bacterias de Origen Veterinario'. This network covers the three critical points
  of veterinary responsibility, bacteria from sick animals, bacteria from healthy
  animals and bacteria from food animals. Key bacteria, antimicrobials and animal
  species have been defined for each of these groups along with laboratory
  methods for testing antimicrobial susceptibility and for data analysis and
  reporting. Surveillance of sick animals was first implemented using Escherichia
  coli as the sentinel bacterium. Surveillance of E. coli and Enterococcus
  faecium from healthy pigs was implemented in 1998. In July 1999, data
  collection on Salmonella spp. was initiated in poultry slaughterhouses.
  Additionally, the prevalence of vancomycin resistant E. faecium was also
  monitored. This network has specific topics of interest related to methods of
  determining resistance, analysis and reporting of data, methods of use for
  veterinary practitioners and collaboration with public health authorities.

AB: Within the frame of the 2nd Iberian Congress of Environmental Contamination
  and Toxicology (University of the Basque Country, Leioa, June 1998) a workshop
  was held about the use of biomarkers in marine pollution monitoring. Among
  others, the following biomarkers received special attention: metallothionein
  induction, acetylcholinesterase inhibition, cytochrome P450 system induction,
  imposex, lysosomal enlargement and lysosomal membrane destabilisation, and
  peroxisome proliferation. These biomarkers can be used to evaluate exposure to
  and effect of different contaminants (metals, organic xenobiotics and
  organometallic compounds) and they can be measured using different
  methodological approaches (biochemistry, cytochemistry, immunochemical methods
  based on the use of biotechnology). Before the application of a set of
  biomarkers in pollution monitoring programmes, well-defined protocols of
  Quality Assurance have to be established to allow adequate comparison of
  results. It is also necessary to include analysis of standard reference
  materials and to obtain detailed knowledge of basal values and seasonal
  variations of the biomarkers in various species, as well as to integrate the
  information obtained with the different biomarkers. Marine bivalve molluscs
  such as mussels are appropriate sentinel species for most of the biomarkers
  proposed except for the induction of the cytochrome P450 system, which should
  be measured in fish, and the degree of imposex, which is a biomarker of
  exposure to TBT specifically measured in certain gastropod molluscs. As a
  result of the workshop, a battery of biomarkers of contaminant exposure and
  effects are proposed that could be incorporated into programmes monitoring the
  quality of the coastal environment in the Iberian Peninsula. These measures
  would be undertaken in conjunction with chemical measures of contaminant
  burdens in selected sentinel species.

AB: Lysosomal responses are widely accepted cellular effect biomarkers of
  general stress. Up to now, these biomarkers have been analysed by means of
  conventional techniques based on enzyme histochemical methods, where lysosomal
  enzymes such as acid phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase (beta-GUS) have been
  employed as markers of lysosomes. The aim of the present work was to develop
  more advanced and sensitive methods based on the use of polyclonal antibodies
  to measure lysosomal enzymes in different sentinel organisms. For this purpose,
  we have studied the cross-reactivity of two commercial polyclonal antibodies
  against the lysosomal enzymes acid phosphatase and beta-GUS with molluscan
  digestive gland by means of immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. The
  antibody against acid phosphatase cross-reacted specifically with the lysosomal
  fraction of the digestive gland, while unspecific immunoreaction occurred with
  digestive gland whole homogenates and tissue sections. The antibody against
  beta-GUS cross-reacted specifically with digestive gland whole homogenates and
  tissue sections. The cross-reactivity of this antibody was tested also in crab
  hepatopancreas and mullet liver where the same successful results were
  obtained. The second aim of the present study was to test if the immuno-based
  approach was sensitive enough to detect lysosomal alterations provoked by
  contaminants. For this purpose two experiments were carried out with mussels
  treated with cadmium in two ways: in vivo treatment by injection and in vitro
  treatment using digestive gland explants. Afterwards immunoblotting studies
  with the antibody against beta-GUS were applied and immunoreactive bands were
  quantified by means of a gel analysis programme. We found that beta-GUS protein
  levels were higher in treated mussels when compared with controls in either in
  vivo or in vitro treatments. All these data suggest that the polyclonal
  antibody against beta-GUS is adequate to be used in immuno-based approaches to
  detect contaminant-induced lysosomal alterations.

AB: Many classes of environmental pollutants are found at significant levels in
  the aquatic environment. We are designing a fish model as an inexpensive and
  efficient system for the assessment of aquatic pollution. Three classes of
  environmental pollutants-halogenated and nonhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons,
  heavy metals, and potent electrophiles-are known to upregulate particular
  mammalian genes via the activation of specific DNA motifs called aromatic
  hydrocarbon (AHREs), heavy metal (MREs), and electrophile (EPREs) response
  elements, respectively. We have made plasmid constructs, using these mammalian
  or trout response elements to drive the luciferase reporter gene. Here we show
  that transient transfection of the zebrafish ZEM2S cell line with these
  reporter constructs imparts dose-dependent gene induction upon exposure to a
  variety of chemicals within each of these three classes of inducers: [a] (AHRE
  -mediated) 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, 3-methylcholanthrene,
  3,4,5,3',4',5'-hexabromobiphenyl, Aroclor 1254, and benzo[a]pyrene; [b] (MRE
  -mediated) Cd(2+), Zn(2+), Hg(2+), and Al(3+); and [c] (EPRE-mediated) tert
  -butylhydroquinone, Hg(2+), Pb(2+), As(3+), Cu(2+), and Cd(2+). As expected,
  some agents gave a response to only one of the three classes, whereas others
  gave a mixed (AHRE- plus EPRE-mediated or MRE- plus EPRE-mediated) response. In
  response to several environmental agents, we found that differences in the
  electrophoretic mobility shift assay, using the AHRE or MRE as probe, were
  consistent with the degree of transcriptional activation seen with the reporter
  constructs. Our data suggest that these reporter constructs might be valuable
  for the generation of transgenic zebrafish in order to carry out mechanistic
  and developmental studies of transcriptional activation by environmental
  contaminants; moreover, such transgenic zebrafish lines might be useful as a
  sentinel for assessing aquatic pollution.

AB: Laginex AS Biological Larvicide (Lagenidium giganteum) and Vectobac-12AS
  (Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis) were compared in plastic pools
  containing laboratory-reared Culex quinquefasciatus larvae located in a wooded
  area in Panama City, FL, in August and September 1997. The pools were dipped at
  2-day intervals to assess larval control. Sentinel larvae in screen-sided cups
  were added to all treatment and control pools at 4-day intervals and evaluated
  for infection at 48 h. Laginex produced larval control up to 20 days as
  compared to the Vectobac-12AS compound, which required retreatment by the 10th
  day. The most effective control was attained by the Laginex 25 treatment, which
  reduced larvae in the pools by 100% for 22 days. Control in the Laginex 15 and
  Laginex 35 treatments dropped to 90% and 74% at day 13 and day 9, respectively.
  The numbers of infected larvae remained above 50% as larval control was
  assessed, but dropped and fluctuated when water temperatures were lowered at
  the onset of cold weather. Organic pollution did not prove to be a significant
  factor in the evaluations.

AB: BACKGROUND: The Minnesota Sentinel Event Notification System for
  Occupational Risks (SENSOR) surveillance system has collected data on the
  medical, personal, and occupational outcomes associated with work-related
  amputations since 1992. METHODS: SENSOR defined amputations as any finger
  amputation or the loss of any other body part; 832 workers were identified as
  having amputation injuries between 1994 and 1995 and 72% of these workers
  completed a telephone interview. RESULTS: Twenty percent of those injured
  required overnight hospitalization. Ninety-one percent of the cases reported
  having missed work, with 56% reporting missing ten or more days. Individuals
  working on their usual jobs at the time of injury were more likely to report
  less serious medical and occupational outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Severe injuries
  were significantly associated with worse medical, personal, and occupational
  outcomes. Two groups of machines, material handling, and powered handtools were
  associated with a higher proportion of severe injuries.

  between 1994 and 1995 and 72% of these workers completed telephone interviews.
  RESULTS: The amputation injury rate for Minnesota workers was 39 per 100,000
  workers, with agriculture and manufacturing having the highest rates. Sixty-six
  percent of the injuries involved one finger; 14% involved two or more fingers.
  Persons working with machinery reported 73% of the injuries. CONCLUSIONS: A
  closer examination of the incidence and causes for amputation injuries shows
  that these were not random events. Reliance on human reactions to prevent
  injury is inadequate; therefore, additional research needs to be conducted.

AB: PURPOSE: The elective treatment of internal mammary lymph nodes (++IMNs) in
  breast cancer is controversial. Previous randomized trials have not shown a
  benefit to the extended radical mastectomy or elective IMN irradiation overall,
  but a survival benefit has been suggested by some for subgroups of patients
  with medial tumors and positive axillary lymph nodes. The advent of effective
  systemic chemotherapy and potential for serious cardiac morbidity have also
  been factors leading to the decreased use of IMN irradiation during the past
  decade. The recent publishing of positive trials testing postmastectomy
  radiation that had included regional IMN irradiation has renewed interest in
  their elective treatment. The purpose of this study is to critically review
  historical and new data regarding IMNs in breast cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS:
  The historical incidence of occult IMN positivity in operable breast cancer is
  reviewed, and the new information provided by sentinel lymph node studies also
  discussed. The results of published randomized prospective trials testing the
  value of elective IMN dissection and/or radiation are analyzed. The data
  regarding patterns of failure following elective IMN treatment is studied to
  determine its impact on local-regional control, distant metastases, and
  survival. A conclusion is drawn regarding the merits of elective IMN treatment
  based on this review of the literature. RESULTS: Although controversial, the
  existing data from prospective, randomized trials of IMN treatment do not seem
  to support their elective dissection or irradiation. While it has not been
  shown to contribute to a survival benefit, the IMN irradiation increases the
  risk of cardiac toxicity that has effaced the value of radiation of the chest
  wall in reducing breast cancer deaths in previous randomized studies and meta
  -analyses. Sentinel lymph node mapping provides an opportunity to further
  evaluate the IMN chain in early stage breast cancer. Biopsy of "hot" nodes may
  be considered in the future to select patients who are most likely to benefit
  from additional regional therapy to these nodes. CONCLUSIONS: Irradiation of
  the IMN chain in conjunction with the chest wall and supraclavicular region
  should be considered only for those with pathologically proven IMNs with the
  goal of improving tumor regional control.

AB: BACKGROUND: Hexamethylene Diisocyanate (HDI) is a color stable aliphatic
  isocyanate that is used in specialty paints as a hardener. Due to the lower
  vapor pressure of its commercial biuret form, it is considered a relatively
  "safe" isocyanate from an exposure standpoint. This case series reports on an
  unusual toxic exposure to HDI. Between November 1993 and May 1994, seven
  specialty painters and one boiler maker who were working at three different
  power plants were examined at the Institute of Occupational and Environmental
  Health at West Virginia University. At their respective work sites, HDI was
  applied to the hot surfaces of boilers that were not shut down, and allowed
  sufficient time to cool. Consequently, these workers were exposed to volatile
  HDI and its thermal decomposition products. METHODS: All of these workers
  underwent a complete physical examination, spirometry, and methacholine
  challenge testing. RESULTS: All 8 workers complained of dyspnea, while 4 of the
  8 also complained of rash. On examination 3 workers were methacholine challenge
  positive and 2 had persistent rash. At follow-up 4 years later, 5 workers still
  had to use inhalation medication and one had progressive asthma and dermatitis.
  All 8 workers, by the time of the follow-up, had gone through economic and
  occupational changes. CONCLUSIONS: This case series reports on an unusual
  exposure to HDI. It is unusual in that: 1) There were two simultaneous sentinel
  cases with two different Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for the same
  product, 2) Exposure was to volatile HDI and its decomposition products and 3)
  Hazardous conditions of exposure occurred at three different sites.

AB: BACKGROUND: While many previous reports describe injuries to adolescents in
  the workplace, few focus on toxic substance exposures among such injuries. Yet
  low-skill, entry-level jobs pose a particular hazard of toxic exposure owing to
  the frequent use of cleaning agents, solvents, and/or other chemicals in
  carrying out assigned tasks. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the types and severity of
  adolescent occupational toxic exposures. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of calls to
  a single regional poison control center (PCC). SETTING: Massachusetts PCC
  poisoning consultations between 1991 and 1996. SUBJECTS: Children aged 19 years
  or younger reporting toxic exposures occurring in the workplace. RESULTS: Of
  7024 occupational toxic exposures recorded by the PCC in the 6 years of study,
  269 incidents (3.8%) involved adolescents aged 14 to 19 years (median age, 18
  years; 124 aged 14-17 years and 145 aged 18-19 years; 65% were male). The most
  frequently involved agents were cleaning compounds (27.8%); paints, solvents,
  and glues (9.0%); caustics (8.7%); hydrocarbons (8.7%); and bleaches (7.3%). Of
  88 cases (32.7%) in which a worksite was identified, food services (30.7%),
  automotive services (14.8%), and general retail stores (12.5%) were the most
  common locations. One hundred fifty-six patients (58.0%) were triaged to an
  emergency department; 7 were hospitalized. Forty-three subjects (16.0%), 18 who
  were between the ages of 14 and 17 years and 25 who were aged 18 or 19 years,
  were judged to have moderate to severe injuries. There were no deaths.
  CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the usefulness of PCC surveillance as a
  source of information about adolescent toxic exposures occurring in the
  workplace. The occupational toxic exposures reported here most commonly
  involved cleaning agents, solvents, paints, caustics, and bleach used in those
  entry-level jobs most frequently filled by adolescents. We conclude that
  occupational toxic exposures are an underrecognized adolescent injury, and that
  PCC experience can be used to fill a gap in the surveillance of such workplace
  -associated events.

AB: Novel approaches to the treatment of cancer include techniques such as gene
  therapy, antiangiogenic therapy, monoclonal antibodies either alone or linked
  with radioactive isotopes or cytotoxins, cancer immunotherapy and vaccines,
  oligonucleotides and antisense technologies as well as anticancer drugs
  targeting single metabolic processes, enzymes or oncoproteins. However,
  substantial improvements are also being made in more conventional cancer
  treatment modalities. These comprise radiotherapy given concomitantly with
  chemotherapy, which appears to improve treatment results in a number of common
  types of human cancer. Other important advances include conformal and intensity
  -modulated radiation therapy, which may allow for higher target doses with
  little or no increase in toxicity. Stereotactic radiation therapy for
  extracranial targets is also being developed, as well as biologically targeted
  radiation therapy, in which targeting is based on metabolic pathways or carrier
  molecules, such as boronated compounds in boron neutron capture therapy or
  monoclonal antibodies in radioimmunotherapy. Sentinel node biopsy and
  neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer represent advances in surgery and
  cancer chemotherapy, which may also allow for a greater chance for organ and
  tissue preservation without a loss in treatment efficacy.

AB: OBJECTIVES: The authors report the results of a prospective, placebo
  -controlled, randomized study to evaluate the effectiveness of 3,4
  -diaminopyridine (DAP) in patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome
  (LEMS) and to determine the acute and long-term side effects of DAP. METHODS:
  Twenty-six patients with LEMS completed a two-arm parallel treatment protocol
  in which DAP, 20 mg three times daily, or placebo was given blindly for 6 days,
  and a quantitative examination of muscle strength (the quantitative myasthenia
  gravis [QMG] score) was used as the primary measure of efficacy. After the
  blinded study, patients were given open-label DAP and monitored for side
  effects as long as there was symptomatic improvement. RESULTS: Twelve patients
  took DAP, and 14 took placebo. There was no difference in the age of LEMS
  onset, gender distribution, incidence of lung cancer, or baseline muscle
  strength between the patients who were randomly assigned to receive placebo and
  those randomly assigned to DAP. Statistical analysis using the Wilcoxon's rank
  sum test demonstrated that patients who received DAP had a significantly
  greater improvement in the QMG score and in the summated amplitude of compound
  muscle action potentials recorded from three sentinel limb muscles. All but one
  LEMS patient had significant symptomatic improvement from subsequent open-label
  DAP. Side effects of DAP were negligible, consisting of perioral and digital
  paresthesia. Laboratory measurements demonstrated no evidence of toxicity
  affecting liver, renal, hematologic, endocrinologic, encephalographic, or
  electrocardiologic function acutely or after 6 months of open-label DAP.
  CONCLUSIONS: This study corroborates previous studies and many years of
  clinical experience showing that DAP is an effective and safe treatment for
  LEMS.

  months, mean weight 4.6 +/- 0.5 g) set as sentinels in cages laid on the soil
  for four weeks, give data for biomonitoring the environmental impact of
  chemicals on soil ecosystems in the field. The survival and the growth of the
  snails are influenced by the nature of the biotope and the level of the
  pollutants. Assay of cadmium, copper, lead and zinc bioaccumulated in the
  tissues of the sentinel snails provides information on the bioavailability of
  metals in the environment. The encagement model, little used for terrestrial
  species, can be useful in monitoring (specific and global endpoints) metal
  pollution of the environment in reference to the trophic level of the primary
  consumers. Active biomonitoring is positively compared with the passive

  of the sentinel lymph nodes in melanoma and breast cancer plays a significant
  role in the clinical management of these patients. The widespread clinical
  acceptance of this technique and the lack of an agreement on which
  radiopharmaceutical agent has the most ideal properties has resulted in a wide
  variety of agents being used clinically with other agents under investigation
  or development. This article reviews some of the physical properties that a
  radiopharmaceutical agent should possess and discusses in depth commonly used
  agents and lists some agents under development. This article also discusses the
  dosimetry and biological effects various radiopharmaceutical agents have for
  lymphoscintigraphy in melanoma and breast cancer patients. In view of the lack
  of a consensus agreement on which radiopharmaceutical agent will provide the
  optimal clinical information this article will provide an overview of
  potentially useful radiopharmaceutical agents and radiation dosimetry
  considerations.

AB: Tissues of greater scaup (Aythya marila mariloides) and components of their
  habitat (sediment, plankton, macroalgae, and invertebrates) were collected for
  heavy metal analysis in the winter of 1996-97 from US Department of the
  Interior wildlife refuges in the Long Island region. Geographic and temporal
  relationships between the concentration of nine metals in tissue and in habitat
  components were examined. In greater scaup tissues and habitat components,
  concentrations of As and Se were highest in Branford, Connecticut; Pb values
  were greatest in Oyster Bay, New York; and Hg concentrations were largest in
  Sandy Hook, New Jersey. Over the course of the winter, the concentration of Hg
  in liver increased, and concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, Se, and Zn in
  kidney decreased. Based on several criteria derived from geographic and
  temporal trends, metals were ranked using the apparent biomonitoring efficacy
  of greater scaup (As = Cr > Cu = Pb = Zn = Hg > Se = Cd > Ni). Although the
  seasonal migration and daily mobility of greater scaup are drawbacks to using
  this species as a sentinel for metal pollution, it was possible to demonstrate
  a relationship between geographic and temporal patterns of metals in habitat
  and greater scaup tissue. However, most metal concentrations in tissue were
  below thresholds known to adversely affect health of waterfowl.

AB: Sira Technologies, Pasadena (USA), a research and development consortium of
  biotechnology companies, have developed a new packaging system designed to
  address the increasing concerns regarding food safety. Called the Food Sentinel
  System, it involves a membrane directly incorporated into the package and
  impregnated with antibodies for specific food pathogens, such as Salmonella
  spp., Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli 0157:H7. One end of the
  membrane is attached to a standard bar code on the outside of the package, and
  the other end is in direct contact with the food. Presence of bacteria triggers
  an immunochemical reaction resulting in formation of a dark area under the bar
  code, making it impossible to read on a checkout scanner, which can be
  programmed to read the type of contamination as well as standard parameters.
  The Cryovac Division of Sealed Air Corp., Duncan (USA), has developed an
  O_ON2_OFF scavenger system which is incorporated into the polymer used to make
  the packaging material, the scavenging action starting when UV rays trigger an
  irreversible oxidation in the polymer.

  concn. of carotenoids and fat-soluble vitamins (retinol, 25-hydroxyvitamin D,
  Alpha-tocopherol, vitamin K (phylloquinone), Alpha-carotene, Beta-carotene,
  lycopene, lutein, zeaxanthin and Beta-cryptoxanthin) were investigated.
  Characterization of the baseline determinants of these serum concn. was carried
  out as a first step in examining potential effects of Olestra exposure. Data
  for 1042 subjects from the sentinel study site (Indianapolis, USA) of the
  Olestra Post-Marketing Surveillance Study were examined. Dietary intake of
  vitamin A, vitamin D, Alpha-tocopherol, phylloquinone and the carotenoids
  affected serum concn. of the respective fat soluble vitamins and carotenoids.
  Overall, the dietary, demographic and lifestyle factors explained little of the
  variability in serum concn. of retinol (R_ON2_OFF = 0.2), 25-hydroxyvitamin D
  (R_ON2_OFF = 0.24) and the carotenoids (R_ON2_OFF = 0.15-0.26). Nevertheless,
  modest amounts of the variability in serum phylloquinone concn. (R_ON2_OFF =
  0.4) and substantial amounts of the variability in serum Alpha-tocopherol
  concn. (R_ON2_OFF = 0.62) were explained by the dietary, demographic and
  lifestyle factors.

AB: Genetic and meristic variations were assessed in mummichogs (Fundulus
  heteroclitus) living in two sites downstream from a bleached kraft pulp mill in
  the Miramichi Estuary (Miramichi E.) (New Brunswick, Canada) and in four
  reference estuaries. Genetic variability detected by electrophoresis of enzymes
  was low except for EST-3. Geographic distribution of rare alleles at four loci,
  discontinuity in allelic frequencies at the EST-3 locus and differences in the
  estimated number of migrants indicated that F. heteroclitus does not form a
  panmictic population in the study area. Temporal variability in allelic
  frequencies at the EST-3 locus was detected only at the site closest to the
  mill (M1). The proportion of fish with high pelvic fin ray counts was
  consistently higher at site M1 and was correlated at all sites to the
  proportion of fish with asymmetric fin ray counts. The possible impact of the
  observed genetic discontinuity on the response of this sentinel species to
  pollutants should be considered in further studies.

AB: Changes in total mercury concentration (T-Hg), diet, and growth were
  monitored in three age-classes and four cohorts of mimic shiners Notropis
  volucellus throughout the ice-free season of 1995 and in early May 1996 and
  1997 in Devils Lake, Wisconsin. All age-classes of fish fed exclusively on
  Daphnia in early spring and late fall but had a mixed diet during the summer
  consisting of zooplankton, other invertebrates, and filamentous algae.
  Concentration of methyl Hg in Daphnia varied during the summer. Concentration
  of T-Hg in age-1 fish also varied during the summer, but all age-classes
  increased in T-Hg concentration during winter. Body burden increased steadily
  throughout the year for all age-classes and cohorts. Each successively older
  age-class of fish had increasingly higher concentrations of T-Hg and body
  burdens. The T-Hg concentration and body burden were significantly different
  between cohorts in early spring for age-1 and age-2 fish. Differences between
  cohorts corresponded to differences in Hg concentrations in the water and
  Daphnia during the cohort's year of birth. Our results suggest that small
  planktivorous fish are a useful sentinel for monitoring short-term changes in
  the availability of Hg in lakes.

AB: Defining virtual elimination has created considerable debate. A traditional
  approach has been to use chemically defined detection limits or levels of
  quantification that are determined using the best currently available
  methodologies. Ever increasing improvements in analytical techniques could lead
  to corresponding pressure to reduce the targets for virtual elimination. The
  current Toxic Substances Management Policy in Canada recognizes this and
  clearly states that it is not the intent of virtual elimination to have a
  moving target or to chase down the last molecule of the chemical of concern.
  Although it may be possible to reduce a chemical to less than some extremely
  sensitive detection limit, the chemical may or may not exert biological effects
  at that level. The chemically defined detection limits may be much lower than
  background levels in the environment, making it an unrealistic target.
  Conversely biological responses may result from trace levels of a compound that
  are not detectable in effluents or selected compartments of the environment
  (i.e., water) using current chemical techniques. Alternatively, an effect-based
  approach can establish biologically meaningful endpoints to defining virtual
  elimination. Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans
  (PCDFs) are used in this study as an example to evaluate the advantages and
  limitations of several possible approaches of using biological endpoints to
  determine the presence of these compounds in the environment and ultimately
  define virtual elimination. A review of the biological responses to PCDD/PCDFs
  is included to demonstrate the importance of selecting appropriate biological
  endpoints. Mixed function oxygenase (MFO) induction, although not recommended
  at this point, is used as an example of a possible sensitive endpoint that
  could potentially be used to detect exposure of biota to these chemicals. Three
  different approaches are explored: (1) measuring MFO induction in a sentinel
  species in the environment; (2) testing environmental extracts for MFO
  induction in cell lines; and (3) using biological endpoints (MFO induction) to
  define chemical targets for virtual elimination. While the use of biological
  endpoints is the most desirable approach to defining virtual elimination, there
  are significant knowledge gaps which limit our selection and application of
  this approach.

AB: As a part of a monitoring programme of a coastal ecosystem submitted to
  chronic anthropic influxes, immunomodulation has been studied in a potential
  sentinel species, the Pacific oyster C. gigas. A double approach has been
  conducted, including a study of immunotoxic effects of selected environmental
  contaminants by controlled exposure in the laboratory, and investigations on
  possible alterations of hemolymph parameters in caged individuals. Standardized
  biological parameters have been measured in hemolymph samples, including
  immunopathological parameters (total and differential counts, cell viability,
  cellular toxicity, serum proteins) and functional parameters of hemocytes
  (aggregation, phagocytosis, intracellular bactericidal activities). Exposure of
  oysters in the laboratory to contaminants identified in estuarine sites (trace
  metals, pesticides) resulted in heavy changes in hemolymph, as hemocytosis and
  inverted subpopulation proportions. Several hemocyte functions related to
  internal defense were altered. These experiments indicate that most of the
  xenobiotics tested have potential immunotoxic effects depending on the
  concentrations applied. In caged individuals, responses identified in
  laboratory experiments were also observed. However, most of these responses did
  not indicate an homogenous trend towards depression since cases of stimulation
  were found. When examining all the parameters together, an altered overall
  status of the internal defense system could be established in the sites with
  the higher contaminant levels. In conclusion, several proofs of
  immunomodulation revealed in this study indicate that many components and
  functions of hemolymph in the Pacific oyster are targets for environmental
  xenobiotics, depressing defense capacities of the individuals. However, as
  already mentioned by other authors, any study on immunotoxicity in such
  organisms should included a panel of measures and assays to established if
  immunosuppression really occurs.

AB: The results of an environmental mutation and teratologic epidemiological
  study are presented which was performed in inhabitants living in the
  surrounding region of an acrylonitrile factory in Nyerges u jfalu. The endpoint
  of the study was congenital abnormalities in 46,326 infants born to mothers
  living in the 30 settlements of the study region within a 25 km radius of the
  acrylonitrile factory between 1980 and 1996. The ascertainment of cases with
  congenital abnormalities was based on the dataset of the Hungarian Congenital
  Abnormality Registry complemented with the review of pediatric, pathology and
  cytogenetic records. A particular attention was paid to the indicators of
  germinal mutations as sentinel anomalies, Down syndrome and unidentified
  multiple congenital abnormalities and the indicators of teratogens as the
  specific pattern of multiple congenital abnormalities. Three congenital
  abnormalities: pectus excavatum in Tata, 1990-1992 (OR with 95%CI: 78.5, 8.4
  -729.6), undescended testis in Nyerges u jfalu between 1980 and 1983 (8.6, 1.4
  -54.3) and in Esztergom, 1981-1982 (4.2, 1.3-13.5) and clubfoot in Tata, 1980
  -1981 (5.5, 1.5-20.3) showed significant time-space clusters in the study
  region. There was a decrease in risk of undescended testis with increasing
  distance from the acrylonitrile factory. An unusual increase was found in the
  combination of oral cleft and cardiac septal defects in multimalformed babies
  in Tatab a nya, 1990. The detailed analysis of congenital abnormalities in all
  settlements of a given territory may help to detect clusters of congenital
  abnormalities and their possible relation to the environmental hazards.

  Ptarmigans (Lagopus lagopus) from two coastal areas in the western Canadian
  arctic. Egg, muscle and liver samples were tested for the presence of 21
  organochlorines and 17 PCB congeners. All contaminants were below detection
  limits (< 0.1 ng/g for organochlorines and < 0.2 ng/g for PCB congeners) in the
  analysed eggs. Alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane, gamma -HCH and QCB were the only
  compounds detected in the muscle samples. In addition to these compounds, OCS,
  trans-Chlordane, trans-Nonachlor, p,p super(1)-DDE, HC Epox and PCB #66/95 were
  detected in the liver samples. The level of contaminants detected in the
  ptarmigan studied was low. The implications of low-level contamination in
  ptarmigan and their sensitivity to contaminants is discussed in regard to their
  contribution to the arctic terrestrial food chain and their suitability as
  terrestrial ecosystem sentinel species in the Canadian Arctic.

AB: This paper discusses the alternative of using biological endpoints rather
  than chemicals detection to determine exposure and set targets for the virtual
  elimination of substances from the environment. The case study of
  polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs) is used as
  an example and several approaches are evaluated: 1) measuring a response in
  sentinel species in the environment, 2) testing environmental samples, and 3)
  using biological endpoints to define chemical targets for virtual elimination.

AB: Presence of persistent contaminants in the marine environment is of great as
  some of them have been identified as genotoxic or carcinogenic to biological
  systems. In the aim to monitor pollution levels and impacts on flora and fauna,
  large biomonitoring programs have been developed to important multidisciplinary
  in situ studies. A large number of enzymatic biomarkers of pollutant exposure
  have been developed and integrated in field studies. Specific biomarkers of
  genotoxicity have also been assessed as "early warning" of pollution effects
  (Burgeot et al. 1996). Due to their bioecological particularities and caging
  possibility, mussels are widely used in biomonitoring. They are the key
  sentinel organisms of the American Mussel Watch Program and French
  biomonitoring network, RNO (Reseau National d'Observation). Among the
  genotoxicity biomarkers, DNA adducts have been widely studied for the last
  decade as their formation is thought to be a crucial event in chemical
  carcinogenesis initiation. In marine environment biomonitoring, several studies
  have been conducted in benthic fishes using the super(32)P-postlabeling
  technique. In situ dose-response relationships have been demonstrated between
  total Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAHs) concentration in sediment and
  hepatic DNA adduct levels (French et al. 1996). Because DNA adduct levels have
  been shown to be correlated with the prevalence of hepatic neoplasms and
  related lesions (Stein et al. 1994) they can be used as early markers of
  chemical carcinogenesis and hence for cancer risk assessment. These
  observations demonstrate the potential use of DNA adducts as a biomarker of
  both PAH exposure and effects.

AB: Numerous natural and anthropogenic chemicals interact with endocrine systems
  of animals. The most widely studied of these endocrine active chemicals (EACs)
  are estrogen receptor agonists and antagonists. Because of the many important
  roles of estrogens in animals, xenoestrogens have the potential to impact
  environmental health. It has been proposed that xenoestrogen contaminants are
  responsible for recent increases in estrogen dependent human diseases and
  sexual and developmental abnormalities in wildlife. Aquatic species are
  particularly susceptible to persistent EACs that accumulate in sediments and
  biomagnify along trophic levels. Rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, commonly
  used in biomedical research and as a sentinel species, was chosen as a model
  for studying mechanisms of xenoestrogen activity. The aims of this research
  were to assess the estrogenic activity of individual persistent, organic
  contaminants and simple mixtures in vivo. Emphasis was placed on determining
  the potential for xenoestrogens to alter sexual development or to induce
  sexually dimorphic biochemical responses.

AB: Models of central place foraging predict that animals should forage more
  thoroughly in resource patches located closer to the central place. Travel
  time, cost of transporting food back to the central place, and exposure to
  predators should all act to increase foraging costs with increasing distance
  from the refuge. We examined habitat and patch use in rock hyraxes (Procavia
  capensis) inhabiting a group of kopjes in a semiarid savanna, Augrabies Falls
  National Park, South Africa. We tested the prediction of more intense patch use
  closer to the central place by measuring givingup densities (GUDs) in
  experimental resource patches set at four different distances from the kopje
  and in two microhabitats differing in cover. Surprisingly, hyraxes had their
  lowest GUDs at intermediate distances from the kopje. These unexpected results
  suggest that the sentinel behaviour of hyraxes alters the probability of
  detection of predators for animals foraging away from the kopje.

AB: We examined the relation between cigarette smoking and (1) the occurrence of
  influenza, (2) the efficacy of influenza vaccination and (3) the antibody
  response to influenza vaccination in fifteen family practices in South-Limburg,
  the Netherlands, during the influenza season 1991-1992. Data were used from a
  randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial into the efficacy of influenza
  vaccination in which smoking status was measured 10 weeks after the start of
  the trial. A total of 1838 subjects aged 60 years or older, of whom 1531
  subjects (321 smokers, 1152 non-smokers and 58 cigar/pipe smokers) who returned
  the smoking questionnaire and were not previously vaccinated, were used in the
  analyses. The main outcome measures were serological influenza (fourfold
  increase of antibody titre between 3 weeks and 5 months after vaccination);
  clinical influenza as determined by criteria of the Dutch Sentinel Stations
  from self reported symptoms in postal questionnaires 10 weeks and 5 months
  after vaccination; increases after vaccination and decreases after 5 months in
  logarithmic titres of antibody against the vaccine strains. No relation between
  smoking and either serological or clinical influenza was found, although the
  risk for serological influenza was slightly (not significantly) elevated in
  smokers compared to non-smokers. A statistical interaction was found between
  smoking and vaccination when serological influenza was the outcome measure
  indicating that the efficacy of vaccination was greater in smokers than in non
  -smokers (comparison of model with and without interaction; likelihood ratio
  test, p < 0.0001). This finding is supported by a greater titre rise 3 weeks
  after vaccination for two out of four strains, but not by the antibody response
  after vaccination in previous studies on influenza and other infectious
  diseases. Also, this possible difference of immunogenicity is not reflected in
  a better protection for clinical influenza. The rise in antibody titre 3 weeks
  after vaccination was higher in smokers for A/Singapore/6/86 and
  B/Beijing/11/87, but not for the other two strains. Decline in titres after 5
  months was similar for smokers and non-smokers. We conclude that smoking has no
  clinical or preventive significance for risk of influenza in the elderly.

AB: Like humans engaged in risky activities, group members of some animal
  societies take turns acting as sentinels. Explanations of the evolution of
  sentinel behavior have frequently relied on kin selection or reciprocal
  altruism, but recent models suggest that guarding may be an individual's
  optimal activity once its stomach is full if no other animal is on guard. This
  paper provides support for this last explanation by showing that, in groups of
  meerkats (Suricata suricatta), animals guard from safe sites, and solitary
  individuals as well as group members spend part of their time on guard. Though
  individuals seldom take successive guarding bouts, there is no regular rota,
  and the provision of food increases contributions to guarding and reduces the
  latency between bouts by the same individual.

AB: The National Status and Trends Mussel Watch data for 1997 were used to
  compare the distribution of parasites between sentinel bivalves of the East,
  West, Gulf and Great Lakes coasts of the USA and to assess the relationship of
  parasitism to contaminant body burden. Overall, five patterns dominated the
  geographic distribution of the parasite fauna. (1) Certain parasites, such as
  Nematopsis, were principally associated with oysters from the southeast and
  Gulf coasts. (2) Discounting Nematopsis, oysters and mussels did not differ
  significantly in total parasite infection intensity. (3) West coast mussel
  populations were always lower in infection intensity than East coast mussels
  and rarely showed anything but a sporadic pattern of infection. (4) East coast
  mussels typically had a focus of infection in the Boston Harbor region. (5)
  With the exception of Nematopsis, mussels on the West coast, Mytilus edulis and
  Mytilus californianus, did not differ significantly in their parasite fauna.
  The geographic distributions of most parasites and disease-causing organisms
  varied independently. Any two parasites rarely co-occurred predictably over
  wide areas and never on more than one coast. Certain contaminants were
  correlated with certain parasites on one coast but not the other or in one
  bivalve type but not another. Statistics that emphasized infection intensity
  found significant relationships between parasitism and contaminant body burden
  most often in East and Gulf coast oysters and West coast mussels and, in most
  cases, higher body burdens were associated with lower infection intensities.
  Statistics that emphasized prevalence also identified significant relationships
  most often in East and Gulf coast oysters and West coast mussels. In contrast
  to infection intensity, most significant results occurred because parasites
  were observed more often in locales characterized by higher contaminant body
  burdens. In no case was a parasite/contaminant pair significant for both
  infection intensity and prevalence.

AB: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) published the Maintenance Rule on
  July 10, 1991 with an implementation date of July 10, 1996. Maintenance rule
  implementation at the Duke Power Company has used probabilistic safety
  assessment (PSA) insights to help focus the monitoring of structures, systems
  and components (SSC) performance and to ensure that maintenance is effectively
  performed. This paper describes how the probabilistic risk assessment (PRA)
  super(1) group at the Duke Power Company provides support for the maintenance
  rule by performing the following tasks: (1) providing a member of the expert
  panel; (2) determining the risk-significant SSCs; (3) establishing SSC
  performance criteria for availability and reliability; (4) evaluating past
  performance and its impact on core damage risk as part of the periodic
  assessment; (5) providing input to the PRA matrix; (6) providing risk analyses
  of combinations of SSCs out of service; (7) providing support for the SENTINEL
  program; and (8) providing support for PSA training. These tasks are not simply
  tied to the initial implementation of the rule. The maintenance rule must be
  kept consistent with the current design and operation of the plant. This will
  require that the PRA models and the many PSA calculations performed to support
  the maintenance rule are kept up-to-date. Therefore, support of the maintenance
  rule will be one of the primary roles of the PSA group for the remainder of the
  life of the plant.

AB: The potential of eelgrass, Zostera marina L., as a sentinel indicator of
  lead (Pb) pollution in the water column was investigated. Eelgrass was grown in
  mesocosms that contained ambient sediment collected from sites near the
  Portsmouth Naval Shipyard Jamaica Island Landfill (JIL) of Kittery, Maine, to
  test viability of eelgrass in the Shipyard's marine sediment. Eelgrass was also
  grown in mesocosms at three shoot densities in marine sediment of three Pb
  concentrations to determine to what extent Pb affects eelgrass growth and
  whether Pb uptake by eelgrass is affected by plant density. Additionally,
  eelgrass was used to detect water-borne sources of Pb. Eelgrass was deployed in
  the water column adjacent to water seepages along the JIL to see if Pb could be
  detected and whether the seepages near the JIL were indicated as sources of Pb
  to the estuary. Mesocosm research showed that eelgrass grew well in Shipyard
  marine sediment, however physiological evidence indicated eelgrass experienced
  some level of toxicity when exposed to high levels of Pb. Shoots growing in
  sediment with high Pb concentrations had significantly lower levels of
  chlorophyll and low Fv/Fm values. Additionally, as shoot density increased, Pb
  uptake decreased in both rhizomes and leaves of shoots growing in Pb enriched
  sediment, indicating a density effect on Pb uptake.

AB: A major goal for genetic toxicologist is to provide precise information on
  exposure and health risk assessment for effective prevention of health
  problems. A frequently used approach for population study has been to utilize
  readily available blood cells (lymphocytes and red blood cells) as sentinel
  cell types to detect biological effects from exposure and to provide early
  warning signals for health risk. However, such approach still cannot be used
  reliably for developing strategies in risk assessment and disease prevention.
  It is possible that other available cell types which are more representative of
  the target cells for disease may be used to overcome the deficiency. In this
  report, the use of non-blood cells for biomonitoring is briefly reviewed. Their
  usefulness in certain exposure condition is highlighted and their effectiveness
  in documenting exposure compared with other cell types such as the traditional
  blood cells is presented. It is obvious that the decision in using these non
  -blood cells in biomonitoring is based on the exposure condition and the
  experimental design. Nevertheless, monitoring studies using non-blood cells
  should be encouraged with emphasis on providing dose-response information,
  comparative response with other cell types and effectiveness for health risk
  assessment.

AB: In October 1998, a workshop sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research
  Program Agency (DARPA) convened to discuss the potential for using instrumented
  aquatic sentinel species to transmit or bring back information relevant to
  environmental and human health hazards in geographical regions of concern.
  Workshop participants, including experts in the fields of ecology, toxicology,
  telemetry, animal behavior, and sensor technology, discussed research on
  tracking free-ranging aquatic organisms and receiving telemetered information
  on movement, behavior, and physiological condition. Monitoring systems now
  functional or under development can monitor physiological parameters such as
  activity and swimming speed, movement patterns, heart rate, cardiac output, and
  ventilation rate. Increasingly sophisticated approaches are being developed for
  interacting with free-ranging aquatic species, and future possibilities include
  the use of various devices to. direct the movements of aquatic organisms to
  specific areas of concern. Considering advances in technology that are now or
  will soon be available, workshop participants discussed how best to implement
  the use of living environmental biomonitors. Workshop participants were
  enthusiastic about the future potential for using aquatic organisms to provide
  timely information on contaminants in freshwater and marine environments.

AB: Herring gulls (Larus argentatus) have been used as sentinel species for
  exposure to toxic chemicals since the 1960s. Reference populations in these
  studies have never been characterized to determine whether genetic differences
  might explain some of the effects seen in gulls at contaminated locations.
  Previously it was shown that there were higher rates of germline minisatellite
  DNA mutation rates in herring gulls colonizing sites located near steel
  industries in urban areas in the Great Lakes. It was suggested that population
  substructuring among gull colonies could account for differences in the
  mutation rates observed as a result of surveying different minisatellite loci.
  Here this explanation is dismissed by showing that genetic exchange among
  herring gull populations within the Great Lakes appears to be sufficient to
  ensure genetic homogeneity of these populations; in contrast, differences exist
  at the minisatellite loci scored between the gulls in the Great Lakes and the
  Maritimes. It is suggested that reference samples for future Great Lakes
  herring gull studies be selected from within the Great Lakes, and that
  potential genetic divergence from Maritime gulls should be investigated in more
  detail.

  to control mosquito larvae in mangrove swamps on Sanibel Island, FL, in May
  1997. Three sites per treatment and 3 untreated sites were used. Temephos
  (Abate) was applied at 37 ml/ha (43% active ingredient [AI]), B.t.i. granules
  (Vectobac G) were applied at 5.606 kg/ha (200 International Toxic Units/mg),
  and methoprene (Altosid ALL) was applied at 213 ml/ha (5% AI). Efficacy was
  quantified by monitoring the survival of caged and uncaged larval Aedes
  taeniorhynchus. We quantified mortality of sentinel nontarget amphipods
  (Talitridae) at all sites, monitored the effect of temephos on flying
  arthropods using light traps, and collected dead insects in tarps suspended
  under mangroves in areas treated with either temephos or methoprene. Each
  pesticide showed good overall efficacy but occasional failures occurred. No
  detectable mortality of amphipods or flying insects attributable to pesticides
  was found. The inconsistent field efficacies of the pesticides indicate a need
  for reinspection of treated sites in this habitat.

AB: Mummichog, a small-sized sentinel fish species, has been proposed for use in
  environmental effects monitoring programs conducted by pulp mills that release
  their effluent in marine waters. In order to evaluate the suitability of
  mummichog as a sentinel species and to support the interpretation of biological
  effects data, tissue concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and
  dibenzofurans, (PCDD/Fs), chlorophenolic compounds (CPs), polychlorinated
  biphenyls (PCBs), and chlorinated pesticides were investigated in mummichog
  sampled in the Miramichi Estuary, which was receiving a bleached-kraft mill
  (BKM) effluent, and in a reference estuary, the Bouctouche Estuary. Higher
  concentrations PCDD/Fs (up to 50 times), CPs (up to 60 times), DDT, and PCBs
  (up to 10 times) were found in mummichog sampled at the upstream site of the
  Miramichi Estuary. At this site, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin toxic
  equivalent concentrations were slightly above the threshold for ethoxy
  resorufin O-deethylase induction. Multivariate analyses on congener profiles
  revealed that the contamination by PCDD/Fs and CPs originated both from the BKM
  and from a former wood-preservation plant and that PCDD/Fs and CPs typical of
  the BKM were transported 40 km downstream from the mill. Patterns and levels of
  persistent contaminants differed between sites within the Estuary, indicating
  that the fish did not mix during their growing period. These findings support
  the use of mummichog in environmental effects monitoring programs, because this
  species bioaccumulates chlorinated compounds contained in BKM effluent and is
  sedentary. The causeeffect relationship between exposure to the BKM effluent
  and the observed biological responses will have to be demonstrated by
  laboratory studies because of the presence of multiple sources of contamination.

AB: We deployed hydroponic eelgrass, Zostera marina L., to test its use as a
  sentinel accumulator and indicator of the source of water-borne lead (Pb)
  contamination in the marine environment. Eelgrass was deployed unrooted in the
  water column in the vicinity of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, located on
  Seavey Island in Portsmouth Harbor of New Hampshire and Maine, offshore from
  seepage sites near the Jamaica Island landfill (JIL). Deployed eelgrass, water
  samples from seepage sites, and sediment from the deployment sites were
  analyzed for Pb concentration and stable Pb isotopic composition. Isotopic
  composition was used to distinguish recent anthropogenic Pb inputs from
  background Pb in the estuary. Isotope ratios indicated that two groundwater
  seeps were a source of recent anthropogenic Pb (i.e. industrial Pb from the
  landfill) to Jamaica Cove. The eelgrass that showed the strongest presence of
  industrial Pb (having the lowest super(206)Pb/ super(207)Pb) was closest to a
  high volume seep that drained from the JIL and had a similar isotope signature
  as well as elevated Pb concentrations. These data confirm a source of water
  -borne industrial Pb in the estuary and show that eelgrass can function as a
  sentinel accumulator of Pb from anthropogenic sources.

AB: We deployed hydroponic eelgrass, Zostera marina L., to test its use as a
  sentinel accumulator and indicator of the source of water-borne lead (Pb)
  contamination in the marine environment. Eelgrass was deployed unrooted in the
  water column in the vicinity of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, located on
  Seavey Island in Portsmouth Harbor of New Hampshire and Maine, offshore from
  seepage sites near the Jamaica Island landfill (JIL). Deployed eelgrass, water
  samples from seepage sites, and sediment from the deployment sites were
  analyzed for Pb concentration and stable Pb isotopic composition. Isotopic
  composition was used to distinguish recent anthropogenic Pb inputs from
  background Pb in the estuary. Isotope ratios indicated that two groundwater
  seeps were a source of recent anthropogenic Pb (i.e. industrial Pb from the
  landfill) to Jamaica Cove. The eelgrass that showed the strongest presence of
  industrial Pb (having the lowest super(206)Pb/ super(207)Pb) was closest to a
  high volume seep that drained from the JIL and had a similar isotope signature
  as well as elevated Pb concentrations. These data confirm a source of water
  -borne industrial Pb in the estuary and show that eelgrass can function as a
  sentinel accumulator of Pb from anthropogenic sources.

AB: We recruited a representative population-based sample of 606 farmers,
  farmworkers, and their families from three areas of England. By defining and
  measuring animal exposure (type, frequency, and species range) we were able not
  only to measure the incidence and prevalence of markers of exposure to zoonotic
  organisms in this sentinel group, but also to determine the risk of exposure to
  zoonotic organisms associated with a variety of defined occupational exposures.
  Prevalence of antibodies to Coxiella burnetii (the cause of Q fever) (29.2%)
  and toxoplasma (50.2%) were high; whereas, prevalence of antibodies to Borrelia
  burgdorferi (the cause of Lyme disease) (0.2%), leptospira (0.2%), and brucella
  (0.7%) were low. The cohort was also exposed to hantavirus (seroprevalence
  4.7%), orthopoxvirus (0.7%), parapoxvirus (4.5%), Bartonella spp. (2.0%)
  Ehrlichia chaffeensis (0.2%), human granulocytic ehrlichiosis agent (1.5%), and
  Echinococcus granulosis 3/202 (1.5%). Coxiella seropositivity was associated
  with exposure to dairy cattle (odds ratio: 1.48, 95% confidence interval: 1.03
  -2.12); cowpox with exposure to rats (odds ratio: 18.7, 95% confidence
  interval: 1.7-201.8). Self-reported clinical orf (contagious pustular
  dermatitis) was associated with exposure to sheep (risk ratio: 7.64, 95%
  confidence interval: 1.93-30.26) and rats (risk ratio 4.54, 95% confidence
  interval: 1.16-17.70); ringworm (dermatophytosis) with cattle (risk ratio:
  1.76; 95% confidence interval: 1.17-2.64).

AB: Wildlife managers are concerned that insecticides used to control mosquitoes
  could suppress invertebrates on which wildlife feed. We assessed whether ultra
  -low volume (ULV) applications of pyrethrin, permethrin, and malathion for
  control of adult mosquitoes reduced macroinvertebrate abundance and biomass or
  killed mosquitofish in seasonal wetlands in California. Pyrethrin was applied
  over 3 seasonal wetlands on Sutter National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), and
  malathion or permethrin were each applied over 2 seasonal wetlands on the
  Colusa NWR. Three control wetlands were used per site. We measured aquatic
  macroinvertebrate abundance and biomass before and after insecticide
  application and compared the survival of mosquito larvae held in sentinel
  cages. At Colusa, we also used mosquitofish as sentinels, caged adult
  mosquitoes over the wetlands to test for pesticide efficacy and drift, and
  sampled night-flying insects using ultraviolet light traps. Results showed no
  detectable reductions in the abundance or biomass of aquatic macroinvertebrates
  in treated wetlands. Larval mosquitoes showed high survival in all areas. All
  adult mosquitoes died when caged over wetlands treated with malathion or
  permethrin, but all survived in controls. All mosquitofish survived. Flying
  insect abundance decreased after insecticide application in both treated and
  control wetlands but rebounded in 48 h. Results indicated that ULV applications
  of these insecticides to control adult mosquitoes are unlikely to have
  substantial effects on the aquatic insects or fish in seasonal wetlands.

AB: The accumulation of larval trematodes by Ilyanassa obsoleta (Gastropoda) at
  2 estuarine sites in Delaware was studied. Initial infection status of snails
  was assayed by looking for shed cercariae. Native snails (most already
  infected) were deployed at sites A and B, and sentinel snails (putatively
  uninfected) were deployed at site B. All were individually marked and, if
  found, reassessed for infection after being free 1-3 summers. Himasthla
  quissetensis, Lepocreadium setiferoides, Zoogonus rubellus, Austrobilharzia
  variglandis, and Gynaecotyla adunca infections were observed in recovered
  snails. At site A, in 1993, 62 natives were recovered. Among the 26 initially
  testing uninfected, 15 had infections at recovery. Of 36 that released
  cercariae, 26 had the infection initially indicated. Of sentinels released at
  site B in 1996, 3 of 16 had infections when recollected. One probably was
  infected before transplant; at least 2 were infected at site B during 1996
  -1997. Among site B natives, 26 were later examined by dissection in 1996; 22
  had the infection status initially revealed. Some site B natives (n = 35)
  escaped recapture in 1996 but were found in 1997, or 1998, or both, and were
  reexamined, most by cercarial release. The same cercariae were produced by 30.
  Among natives (both sites, n = 123), 27.6% exhibited some difference in
  infection status compared to the initial assay. This probably overestimates
  changes. Some differences were real but most can be discounted as cases where
  initial infection status was misrepresented.

AB: In this study, the pH, temperature and substrate specificity for
  cholinesterases (ChE) assay in two bivalves was optimized: the Spanish mussel
  Mytilus galloprovincialis and the Asiatic clam Corbicula fluminea. The optimal
  values found are pH 7, 25 degree C, 2 mM of acetylthiocholine (ASCh) as
  substrate for M. galloprovincialis and pH 8, 25 degree C, 5 mM
  propionylthiocholine (PrSCh) for C. fluminea. The apparent K sub(m) are 30 and
  70 mu M for the two bivalves, respectively. In comparison with some other
  crustaceans and fishes, the levels of ChE activity were found to be low. The in
  vitro and in vivo sensitivities of the ChEs activity toward two well known
  pesticides: carbaryl and methylparathion (or its oxon derived form) are
  comparable to that observed in fishes but less than that found in crustaceans.
  Although further studies should be done, and other contaminants tested, the
  studied bivalves can be considered as interesting `sentinel' species in the
  monitoring of the acute water contamination by pesticides.

AB: In the suricate (Suricata suricatta), a cooperatively breeding mongoose, one
  individual typically watches out for predators while the rest of the group is
  foraging. Most of the time these sentinels announce their guarding duty with
  special vocalizations. The response of foraging group members to these calls
  was investigated by analysing observational data, and by performing playback
  experiments. The use of special calls by sentinels, and the responses of the
  foraging group members to them, suggest that the coordination of vigilance is
  strongly influenced by vocal communication. Sentinel calls decreased the time
  spent alert by the foraging group members. Other group members were less likely
  to go on guard when a sentinel was vocalizing. Both the proportion of time
  during which guards overlapped, and the proportion of time the group was
  unprotected without a guard, decreased when sentinels announced their duty, due
  to better coordination of the rotation of sentinels. Suricates, however, do not
  appear to use sentinel calls to mediate a strict rotation of guarding duty.

AB: Avian botulism is an important disease affecting many species of waterbirds
  in North America, but the environmental conditions that initiate outbreaks are
  poorly understood. To determine wetland attributes associated with outbreaks of
  avian botulism in waterbirds at the Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge (SNWR),
  California, we compared environmental characteristics between wetlands where
  outbreaks occurred (outbreak wetlands) and did not occur (nonoutbreak
  wetlands). In June through October 1987-89, we monitored the occurrence of
  avian botulism via observations for sick or dead sentinel mallards (Anas
  platyrhynchos) placed in 4 wetland enclosures. During this same time period, we
  collected environmental data from the water column and sediments of each
  wetland enclosure at 10-14-day sampling intervals. Multivariate analysis was
  used to reduce 22 environmental variables to 7 factors for inclusion in
  subsequent statistical analyses. We found that outbreak wetlands had
  significantly lower redox potential than nonoutbreak wetlands. The probability
  of botulism in sentinel mallards was associated with increasing temperature,
  increasing invertebrate abundance or biomass, and decreasing turbidity.
  However, because these factors were not consistently higher in outbreak
  wetlands compared to nonoutbreak wetlands, they may have a more proximate
  effect in initiating an outbreak.

AB: Application of a sentinel species-based population evaluation using creek
  chub (Semotilus atromaculatus), a common minnow in eastern North America, could
  provide a framework for environmental assessments and focus future research in
  small streams. Analysis of creek chub endpoints (growth, condition, fecundity)
  was based on an assessment framework for white sucker (Catostomus commersoni)
  populations. We evaluated creek chub and fish community endpoints
  simultaneously in two streams with differing degrees of urbanization,
  agriculture, and thermal regimes during spring, summer, and fall. Fish from the
  more altered stream appear to be suffering from a feeding-based niche shift,
  and demonstrate reproductive anomalies suggestive of exposure to some unknown
  sublethal stressor(s). Fish community assessments identified modified habitat
  and water quality but did not detect the presence of any additional
  stressor(s). Similarity in fish community and population responses, widespread
  distribution of creek chub, limited within-stream movements, and the ability of
  this species to populate even the smallest streams where the resident fish
  community may be depauperate and fish community-type assessments limited, makes
  the potential use of creek chub as a monitor for small streams promising over a
  wide geographic zone.

AB: Heavy metals (namely Cr, Cu, Zn, As, Hg, Pb, Ni, and Ag) that are present at
  concentrations common in ambient marine waters can cause adverse effects in
  shellfish. Such effects can significantly impact the trophic structure of a
  biological community. Heavy metals uptake is dependent on both geochemical and
  biological factors. In bivalves, the extent of accumulation is a function of
  several biotic and abiotic variables. Based on several criteria, (including: an
  ability to accumulate metals without suffering mortality, habitation within,
  and continuous exposure to, the contaminated matrix, hardiness, and ease of
  sampling) bivalve molluscs have proven to be useful biomonitors for a host of
  inorganic contaminants. It is essential that the biomonitoring plan is not only
  site specific, but that it considers the use of indigenous species whenever
  possible. This paper will provide a general review of studies that have
  employed bivalved shellfish as sentinel bioindicators in marine environments
  impacted by heavy metals, and give suggestions for conducting biomonitoring
  assays.

AB: In 1995, Nasonia vitripennis (Walker) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae), a
  commercially available pupal parasitoid of the house fly, Musca domestica L.,
  and stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans (L.) (Diptera: Muscidae), was purchased to
  examine the status of wasps being sold to Manitoba producers. Percentage of
  pupae parasitized, numbers of parasitoids per pupa, total parasitoids, and
  parasitoid sex ratio were determined for each shipment of parasitoids received.
  To determine the extent to which these wasps could successfully parasitize
  house flies and stable flies, parasitoids were released weekly in four Manitoba
  dairy barns and levels of parasitism estimated. In 10 622 freeze-killed
  sentinel house fly pupae, 2.2% were parasitized throughout the season by N.
  vitripennis, and 5.8% were parasitized by eight other species of parasitoids.
  Of 11 897 naturally occurring house fly and stable fly pupae, 0.6% were
  parasitized by N. vitripennis, and 3.4% by eight other species of parasitoids.
  In four barns where there were no releases of N. vitripennis, 1.1% of 11 779
  sentinel pupae were parasitized by four species of parasitoids and 3.8% of 8384
  naturally occurring house fly and stable fly pupae were parasitized by nine
  species. The release of an estimated 3 648 093 N. vitripennis did not result in
  substantial parasitism in either sentinel pupae or naturally occurring pupae.
  In 1996, live sentinel house fly pupae (n = 50 842) and house fly and stable
  fly pupae occurring naturally (n = 4691) were collected in two of the
  nonrelease barns from the 1995 study to examine the activity of endemic
  parasitoids. Of the sentinel and naturally occurring pupae sampled, 4.0% and
  9.4% were parasitized, respectively. Phygadeuon fumator Gravenhoerst
  (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) was the most abundant parasitoid, accounting for
  97.4% and 79.9% of parasitoids collected from sentinel pupae and naturally
  occurring pupae, respectively. Other parasitoids included Urolepis rufipes
  (Ashmead), Muscidifurax raptor Girault and Sanders, Muscidifurax zaraptor Kogan
  and Legner, Spalangia subpunctata Foerst, Spalangia cameroni Perkins, Spalangia
  nigra Latreille, and a species of Trichomalopsis Crawford (Hymenoptera:
  Pteromalidae).

AB: Marine bivalve molluscs such as the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) and the
  soft shell clam (Mya arenaria) have been used as sentinel organisms of
  contaminant bioavailability and the biological consequences of contaminant
  exposure. Biological responses that may contribute to the impairment of
  reproductive and developmental processes include responses that can be
  categorized as interfering with bioenergetic processes such as feeding and
  nutrient allocation; biosynthetic processes, such as the synthesis of energy
  stores; and morphogenic processes, such as those involved in structural
  development. Case studies within New Bedford and Boston Harbors (Massachusetts)
  are used to examine the relationship between contaminant uptake and effects on
  the reproductive cycle and bioenergetics of mussels and soft shell clams. The
  results observed illustrate that disruption in bioenergetics in bivalve
  molluscs exposed to chemical contaminants can result in loss of reproductive
  output and increased susceptibility to disease. Differences in the extent of
  reproductive impairment may be linked specifically to energetic strategies of
  individual species.

AB: Heavy metals are stable and persistent environmental contaminants. The range
  of metal concentrations is generally below acute thresholds in coastal areas,
  where recognition of chronic sublethal effects is more relevant. Evidence of
  long-term adverse effects, such as cancer, due to heavy metals in marine
  animals comes from a number of field and experimental studies. The mechanism of
  metal carcinogenicity remains largely unknown, although several lines of
  experimental evidence suggest that a genotoxic effect may be involved. The aim
  of our study was to evaluate the sensitivity of genotoxicity tests, alkaline
  elution and micronucleus test, as biomarkers for the detection of heavy metals
  in mussels as the sentinel species. Experimental studies were carried out on
  Mytilus galloprovincialis exposed in aquarium (5 days) to different
  concentrations of three selected metal salts, CuCl sub(2) (5, 10, 20, 40, 80 mu
  g/l/a), CdCl sub(2) (1.84, 18.4, 184 mu g/l/a), and HgCl sub(2) (32 mu g/l/a),
  and to a mixture of equimolar doses of the three metals to study the results of
  their joint action. Metallothionein quantitation was used as a marker of metal
  exposure. Lysosomal membrane stability was applied to evaluate the influence of
  physiological status on genotoxic damage. The ranking of genotoxic potential
  was in decreasing order: Hg > Cu > Cd. Cu and Hg caused an increase of DNA
  single-strand breaks and micronuclei frequency. Cd induced a statistical
  increase of DNA damage, but gave negative results with the micronucleus test. A
  relationship between genotoxic effects and metallothionein content was
  observed. Reduction in lysosomal membrane stability with the increasing
  concentration of heavy metals was also evident.

AB: Cave faunas - which often contain a high representation of spiders - are
  subject to increasing pressure from the effects of epigean habitat degradation
  and recreational caving activities. Hickmania troglodytes is a prominent member
  of the Tasmanian cave fauna, a spider of phylogenetic, zoogeographic and
  ecological importance, but about which little has previously been known. Long
  -term monitoring has revealed many unusual life-cycle characteristics in this
  species, most of which occur over long periods of time and are dependent upon
  environmental stability. The species presents a potentially useful tool in the
  management and monitoring of cave fauna and karst, as it is large, conspicuous,
  numerous, ubiquitous, sedentary, functionally significant and potentially
  sensitive to various sources of disturbance. H. troglodytes may provide a
  visible and obvious measure of disturbance in and around cave entrances, and
  may also prove useful in detecting broader scale impacts affecting the entire
  cave. Many promising developments are being made in terms of cave management in
  Tasmania, but other issues are less well addressed and still need to be
  resolved. With further research, the use of indicator or sentinel species may
  prove to be well suited to the less complex and often sparsely populated
  subterranean environment, and may play an important role within larger
  management strategies for cave fauna and karst.

  locus was detected only at the site closest to the mill (M1). The proportion of
  fish with high pelvic fin ray counts was consistently higher at site M1 and was
  correlated at all sites to the proportion of fish with asymmetric fin ray
  counts. The possible impact of the observed genetic discontinuity on the
  response of this sentinel species to pollutants should be considered in further
  studies.

AB: The effect of density of the Shin-Etsu twist-tie rope pheromone formulation
  (PBW rope L registered ) on mating of female pink bollworm, Pectinophora
  gossypiella (Saunders) was tested in Israel. The success of mating disruption
  was evaluated during 1997 by the mating table technique, comparing the
  percentage of mating of virgin sentinel females in pheromone-treated and
  control plots. Under low pest population pressure application of `long-life'
  formulation of P. gossypiella pheromone, PBW rope L registered , spaced 9 m, 11
  m and 14 m apart, resulted in very high suppression of mating (96.5-100%) and
  complete shut-down of pheromone trap catch. These application rates were much
  lower than those now prevailing in Israel and elsewhere. Spacing of ropes 20 m
  apart resulted in less effective mating disruption of 65% only, and shut-down
  of pheromone traps was also incomplete. The tests during 1998 were carried out
  at high pest population and efficacy of treatments was assessed by the
  reduction of male capture in traps in pheromonetreated plots relative to
  catches in the control. The distance between pheromone sources proved to be the
  most critical factor determining success. In both years, any spacing
  significantly greater than 10 m gave markedly less than complete trap catch
  shutdown/mating suppression. Pheromone dosages and population density were also
  important in determining mating success. Results obtained in this study
  indicate the possibility of reducing the number of pheromone sources per unit
  area and the total amount of pheromone as compared with that in use today, only
  at very low pest populations. However at high population levels, dispensers
  closely-spaced, with increased dosages of pheromone, are required.

AB: Since 1965, macrobenthic communities have been studied in the area
  surrounding the sewer outfall of Marseille, France. The polluted zone increased
  by a factor of 3 and the subnormal zone increased by a factor of 10 between
  1970 and 1980. After construction of a primary treatment plant in 1987, the
  macrobenthos of the polluted zone decreased significantly in terms of number of
  individuals. This decrease was apparently caused by a reduction of organic
  matter discharged to the sea and was particularly notable near the discharge.
  However, composition of communities began to change in 1992 to 1993. Benthic
  samples taken at depths of 35, 39, and 51 m in July 1994 and January 1995
  indicated a recovery of parts of a polluted zone to a community resembling the
  subnormal zone. Most notable is the disappearance of species indicative of the
  polluted zone at stations H3 and H4 and the decrease at station I7 (nearest the
  outfall). Also, sentinel species of the subnormal zone and species
  characteristic of the unpolluted zone increased in number. The study
  demonstrated a complete change of communities at stations I7 and H4 between
  1990 and 1994. Communities at these two stations, both near the sewer outfall,
  are characteristic of the subnormal zone. The community at station H3 that
  belonged to the subnormal zone displayed a degree of structural stability. Then
  changes in benthic populations indicated that construction of the primary
  treatment plant reduced contamination in the area and may lead to recovery of
  the benthos in this region.

AB: Uptake and loss of cobalt-57 were investigated in the starfish Asterias
  rubens, in order to assess its value as a sentinel organism for nearshore
  radionuclide contamination. Whole-body uptake from sea water was linear over a
  32-day exposure period and reached wet weight concentration factor (CF) of 23
  plus or minus 5. Bioaccumulation of super(57)Co was dependent upon body
  compartment, the aboral part of the body wall concentrating cobalt to the
  greatest degree (wet weight CF: 77 plus or minus 16). After restoration of
  uncontaminated conditions, radiocobalt was released following an exponential
  loss kinetics characterized by a biological half-life (T sub(b one half )) of
  27 plus or minus 6 day. Dietary radiocobalt (taken up during a short-term
  feeding for 24 h on radiolabelled mussels) showed a much more rapid turnover
  time (T sub(b one half ): 14 plus or minus 4 d), suggesting that A. rubens
  accumulates this radionuclide predominantly from sea water. A. rubens, and more
  particularly the aboral part of its body wall, would readily reveal the
  presence of an environmental contamination by radiocobalt and could preserve
  this information over a period of few months.

AB: The aim of this investigation was to quantify the effects of tributyltin
  (TBT) on the immune reactivity of haemocytes from the cultivated clam Tapes
  philippinarum (Adams and Reeve, 1850) using a series of in vitro bioassays. It
  is known that TBT has adverse effects on cellular immune functions like
  mobility, phagocytosis and lysosomal enzyme activity. As defining TBT-sensitive
  immunologic biomarkers in sentinel organisms is important in the field of
  ecotoxicology, the authors propose three indexes, amoebocytic (A.I.),
  phagocytic (P.I.), and lysosomal activity (L.A.I.), as sensitive and useful
  biomarkers to assess environmental risks due to TBT contamination.

AB: Objective: To assess the spread of HIV into rural areas. Methods: Since 1994
  a demographic surveillance system (with 5-monthly rounds) and open adult cohort
  study have been established in a rural ward in Tanzania. Two sero-surveys of
  all resident adults aged 15-44 and 15-46 years were conducted in 1994-1995 and
  1996-1997 respectively. Qualitative data were collected on mobility, bars and
  commercial sex. Results: Attendance of the two rounds of survey was 5820 (78%)
  and 6413 (80%) in 1994/1995 and 1996/1997 respectively. HIV prevalence
  increased from 5.8% to 6.6%. HIV incidence was 0.73 and 0.84 per 100 person
  years among men and women respectively. HIV incidence under the age of 20 years
  was low among both sexes. Striking differences in HIV prevalence and incidence
  were observed within the small geographic area studied: HIV prevalence in the
  trading center was twice that in the area surrounding the trading center
  (within 2 km) and three to four times that in the rural villages (within 8 km
  of the trading center). Aggregate level data showed significant differences
  between the trading center and nearby rural villages in terms of sexual
  behavior, commercial sex workers, mobility of the population, and alcohol use.
  Conclusion: This study documents the existence of very substantial HIV
  prevalence and incidence differences within a small geographic rural area. The
  rapid decrease in HIV prevalence within a small rural area emphasizes the
  importance of concentrating HIV prevention efforts on high transmission areas,
  such as trading centers, especially in resource-poor settings. Furthermore,
  this has considerable implications for monitoring the spread of HIV through
  sentinel sites, as such sites are typically located in high transmission areas.

AB: Six male and six female Yucatan pigs were utilized to investigate the
  feasibility of this species as a non-rodent model for routine regulatory and
  mechanistic toxicology studies. This study evaluated disease surveillance and
  computerized electrophysiology, along with possible gross and micropathology
  changes. Two pigs were used as sentinel animals to evaluate the microbiological
  status of the vendor upon arrival; the other pigs were maintained as
  biomonitors and to provide baseline clinical chemistry, urinalysis, pathology
  and electrophysiology data. The electrophysiology tests conducted included
  electrocardiography (ECG), electroretinography (ERG) and quantitative
  electroencephalography (qEEG), which achieved consistent baseline values with
  acceptable intrasubject variation. Tissue cholinesterase and histochemical
  staining were done to determine their suitability for testing cholinesterase
  compounds. Evaluation of the serum chemistry profile demonstrated increased CPK
  and LDH, which was likely associated with slight haemolysis or minor
  subclinical muscle stress during handling. There were no additional clinical
  chemistry changes or findings in haematology, urinalysis parameters or gross
  pathology. Micropathology found an absence of background lesions which would
  interfere with routine toxicology studies, except for a mild rhinitis. The
  aetiological agent was identified by electron microscopy as being consistent
  with inclusion body rhinitis of swine, previously unreported in miniature
  swine. This would most notably interfere with inhalation studies. The
  anatomical and physiological similarities of the Yucatan pig, along with its
  ability to accept the performance of electrophysiology tests allow this species
  to be considered as a suitable model for organ system testing in toxicology
  studies.

AB: BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph node biopsy with Technetium 99m sulfur colloid
  (Tc99m) is an evolving technique that offers the potential for improved staging
  of breast cancer with decreased morbidity. However, the use of radioactive
  materials in the operating room generates significant concern about radiation
  exposure. The purpose of this study was to evaluate radiation exposure to
  operating room personnel, pathologist, and equipment from specimens during
  breast sentinel lymph node biopsy. METHODS: Twenty patients were injected with
  0.7 to 1.1 mCi of Tc99m sulfur colloid 1.5 to 3 hours before sentinel lymph
  node biopsy. A calibrated Geiger counter was used to measure dose rates from
  the breast injection site before skin incision (n = 20), lumpectomy specimens
  (n = 8), and sentinel nodes (n = 20) at distances of 3, 30, and 300 cm. This
  represented exposure to the surgeon's hands, surgeon's torso, and scrub nurse,
  respectively. Exposure to the pathologist's hands and torso was represented as
  dose-rate measurements from lumpectomy and nodal specimens. The operative
  instruments, trash receptacles, suction canisters, pathology slides, and
  cryostat machines were measured at 3 cm at the conclusion of each procedure.
  Specimens or equipment emitting radiation doses equal to background levels
  (0.04 mRem/h) were exempt from special handling and disposal. RESULTS: The
  highest exposure rate was to the surgeon's hands from the breast injection site
  before skin incision (34.25 mRem/h). Exposure to the surgeon's torso measured
  1.33 mRem/h, and exposure to the scrub nurse's torso measured 0.15 mRem/h from
  the injection site. Exposure to the pathologist's hands was 18.62 and 0.06
  mRem/h from the lumpectomy specimen and sentinel node, respectively. Exposure
  to the pathologist's torso measured 0.34 and 0.04 mRem/h from the lumpectomy
  specimen and sentinel node, respectively. One hundred percent of lumpectomy
  specimens measured above the exempt level. Thirty-two of 46 (70%) sentinel
  lymph nodes emitted radiation equal to the exempt background level. Seventeen
  of 20 trash receptacles (85%) and 4 of 12 (33%) suction canisters measured
  equal to background levels. All operative instruments, pathology slides, and
  cryostat machines were equal to background levels. CONCLUSIONS: Radiation
  exposure to operating room personnel, pathologists, and operative equipment
  during a breast sentinel node biopsy using Tc99m is minimal. A primary surgeon
  can perform 2,190 hours, a scrub nurse 33,333 hours, and a pathologist 14,705
  hours of procedural work before surpassing Occupational Safety and Health
  Administration limits. Operative instruments, pathology slides, and cryostat
  machines do not require special handling. All lumpectomy specimens should be
  stored for decontamination until the dose rate equals background levels.
  Intraoperative dose-rate monitoring allows selective decontamination of nodal
  specimens, trash receptacles, and suction canisters, which decreases disposal
  time and cost.

  to control mosquito larvae in mangrove swamps on Sanibel Island, FL, in May
  1997. Three sites per treatment and 3 untreated sites were used. Temephos
  (Abate) was applied at 37 ml/ha (43% active ingredient [AI]), B.t.i. granules
  (Vectobac G) were applied at 5.606 kg/ha (200 International Toxic Units/mg),
  and methoprene (Altosid ALL) was applied at 213 ml/ha (5% AI). Efficacy was
  quantified by monitoring the survival of caged and uncaged larval Aedes
  taeniorhynchus. We quantified mortality of sentinel nontarget amphipods
  (Talitridae) at all sites, monitored the effect of temephos on flying
  arthropods using light traps, and collected dead insects in tarps suspended
  under mangroves in areas treated with either temephos or methoprene. Each
  pesticide showed good overall efficacy but occasional failures occurred. No
  detectable mortality of amphipods or flying insects attributable to pesticides
  was found. The inconsistent field efficacies of the pesticides indicate a need
  for reinspection of treated sites in this habitat.

AB: The occurrence of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MT) is a sentinel event in
  occupational and environmental medicine. The association of pleural MT and
  asbestos exposure is well documented and it is well known that no threshold can
  be demonstrated below which there is no risk of developing MT. During the
  period 1994-1998, 3 patients were referred from the Pneumology Division to the
  Occupational Medicine Department of the Spedali Civili in Brescia. They had MT
  and they had a peculiar asbestos exposure. A thorough occupational and
  environmental history was taken by means of a standardized questionnaire. The
  first patient was environmentally exposed to crocidolite when she lived near an
  asbestos mine in Australia. The second was a teacher and the third was a
  goldsmith and both were occupationally exposed to asbestos. The case
  descriptions revealed the importance of a standardized evaluation of
  occupational and environmental exposure to asbestos. In this way otherwise
  ignored asbestos exposures can be identified therefore avoiding an
  underestimation of MT attributable to asbestos. The role of the occupational
  physician, both in hospital referrals and while taking standardized histories,
  is also stressed along with the importance of this contribution on the one hand
  to the epidemiological recording of sentinel events and on the other to the
  etiological definition of the cases, which was in fact our principal aim.

AB: Although we are moving towards eradication, risks remain. The number of
  people at risk of polio paralysis has been seriously underestimated, as has the
  danger of escape of polioviruses from laboratories. Virulent strains, still
  used in the US, should be destroyed. Surveillance of acute flaccid paralysis
  (AFP) and tracing suspected cases is difficult and still uncertain in many
  countries. The crucial definition by WHO of polio paralysis as asymmetric is
  ambiguous and misleading: in the Indian sub-continent and elsewhere, 75% have
  received unnecessary injections for fever 48 h before paralysis. These
  injections alter the severity and pattern of paralysis: 50% of Indian cases
  have symmetrical paralysis by limb and 25% by muscle. Eradication of polio
  promises a New Deal for Health, it must succeed.

AB: Taurine chloramine (TauCl) is a major chloramine generated in activated
  neutrophils as a result of the reaction of highly toxic hypochlorous acid and
  taurine, the most abundant free amino acid in cytosol. In this study we have
  tested the influence of TauCl on the properties of murine dendritic cells (DC),
  the major cell population involved in the initiation of an adaptive immune
  response against pathogenic organisms. N418+, MHC II+, B7-2+ dendritic cells,
  generated from the mouse bone marrow cells cultured in the presence of
  granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, were stimulated by interferon
  -gamma and lipopolysaccharide to produce nitric oxide, reactive oxygen species,
  interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumour necrosis factor-alpha, and IL-12, in the presence
  of different doses of TauCl. TauCl differently inhibited the generation of
  these inflammatory mediators in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, TauCl
  selectively modulated the ability of DC to induce the release IL-2 and IL-10
  from T cells. These results suggest that neutrophil-derived mediators, such as
  TauCl, at a site of inflammation, may affect the functions of sentinel DC and
  macrophages, and play a role in maintaining the balance between the
  inflammatory response and the induction of an antigen-specific immune response.

AB: Five topics regarding CT diagnosis of the gastrointestinal tract are
  discussed with illustrative cases: 1) Fat-containing tumors can be seen in the
  esophageal lumen, and their differential diagnosis includes not only lipoma and
  liposarcoma (sometimes teratoma) but also fibrovascular polyp and
  carcinosarcoma. 2) The multi-layered pattern of the gastric wall observed on
  dynamic CT is important for the differential diagnosis of gastric lesions and
  the staging of gastric cancer. 3) Swelling of the sentinel lymph nodes is an
  important finding for correct staging of cancer, incidental detection of occult
  cancer, and diagnosis of the origin of abdominal tumors. 4) Air-inflated CT and
  virtual CT endoscopy of the colon are necessary for the detection of small
  colorectal cancers, and multi-planar reconstruction (MPR) images vertical to
  the lesions are helpful for cancer staging. 5) MRI and CT with MPR images are
  useful for the evaluation of anorectal fistula.

AB: The protocols for sentinel lymph node biopsy and radioguided occult lesion
  localization could potentially be of great value in the management of breast
  cancer patients. Both involve the injection of a 99Tcm-labelled
  radiopharmaceutical close to or into the lesion, localization of the sentinel
  lymph node or occult lesion by scintigraphy, and surgical removal with the aid
  of a hand-held gamma-ray detector. We present dosimetric data on patients and
  hospital personnel involved in these procedures. For evaluation of radiation
  protection, we measured the absorbed dose and air kerma rate. Activity levels
  in excised tissues and surgical instruments were also determined. For patients,
  the mean absorbed dose to the abdomen was 0.45 mGy, which is low compared to
  doses received from other diagnostic examinations. For surgeons after 100
  operations, the mean absorbed dose to the hands was 0.45 mGy and the mean
  effective dose 0.09 mSv. Absorbed doses to all hospital personnel involved in
  the procedures were very low compared to recommended annual limits stipulated
  by the International Commission on Radiological Protection. We conclude that
  these procedures, performed according to protocols laid down by the European
  Institute of Oncology, Milan, are safe from the point of view of radiological
  protection and that only routine precautions are necessary.

AB: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is an important plastic resin for construction,
  pipe and tubing, siding, and other uses. Exposures to vinyl chloride monomer
  during the early years of production resulted in an important sentinel health
  event: the recognition of an excess of a rare liver cancer, hepatic
  angiosarcoma, at facilities throughout the world. Several other syndromes,
  including acro-osteolysis, also have been associated with PVC, but less clearly
  with vinyl chloride. Extensive research ranging from large-scale epidemiologic
  studies to biomarker research into molecular mechanisms continues to provide
  valuable insight into the pathogenesis of occupational cancer.

AB: OBJECTIVE: Design features of intraoperative probes are presented. A brief
  discussion of the sentinel node concept and relevant radiopharmaceuticals is
  given. The importance of the injection technique and the necessity of imaging
  in radiotracer techniques for sentinel node detection are explained. Probe
  calibration, procedural precautions, intraoperative techniques, and radiation
  dosimetry relevant to the successful use of intraoperative probes are
  discussed. Intraoperative use of gamma probes requires a team effort involving
  surgery and nuclear medicine personnel and requires that team members
  understand the fundamentals of probe use. After reading this paper, the nuclear
  medicine technologist will be able to: (a) describe present day and future
  potential use of intraoperative probes; (b) define the sentinel lymph node
  (SLN) concept; (c) state the radiopharmaceuticals and injection techniques used
  for SLN evaluation; (d) name several SLN detection procedures; and (e) discuss
  the design features and care of currently available probes.

AB: BACKGROUND: Recent advances in the staging and treatment of melanoma were
  reviewed. METHODS: A literature-based review was performed. RESULTS: The
  current American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Staging system for melanoma
  has several drawbacks. Proposed changes in the staging system to take into
  account simplified tumor thickness categories, tumor ulceration, and the number
  (rather than size) of nodal metastases will allow stage groups with more
  uniform prognosis. The widespread application of sentinel lymph node biopsy for
  nodal staging allows accurate nodal staging with minimal morbidity. Reverse
  transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a very sensitive molecular
  staging test that may prove useful for identifying early metastatic disease.
  There is finally an effective adjuvant therapy for melanoma--interferon alfa
  -2b. Other adjuvant therapies, including melanoma vaccines, may provide
  effective and less toxic alternatives. New immunotherapy and gene therapy
  strategies are under investigation. CONCLUSIONS: Ongoing and future adjuvant
  therapy trials will benefit from improved melanoma staging by accrual of
  homogeneous groups of patients. New approaches for adjuvant therapy await
  completion of clinical trials. Innovative new therapies offer hope for patients
  with advanced disease.

AB: PURPOSE: Our purpose was to assess sperm deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
  integrity after exposure to antisperm antibodies. METHODS: Donor semen were
  divided and exposed to sera containing IgG, IgA, and IgM antisperm antibodies.
  Untreated portions served as the control. After incubation (1 hr, 23 degrees
  C), the sperm were centrifuge-washed, resuspended, and incubated (23 degrees C)
  for 2, 5, 7, or 9 days. Acridine orange staining and kinematic parameters were
  measured. The sentinel (17q21 from D17S855) and beta-globin genes were
  amplified and analyzed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. RESULTS:
  Sperm preexposed to antisperm antibodies had deleted sentinel gene on days 7
  and 9. The beta-globin gene was intact. There were no differences in acridine
  orange staining. CONCLUSIONS: Sperm artificially exposed to antisperm
  antibodies resulted in a subtle deletion of genetic material. The DNA
  alteration process was slow and was undetectable at the gross level. More
  studies are needed to confirm the findings and determine whether DNA repair
  mechanisms can reverse the damage.

AB: Adverse events (AEs) in medical patients are common, costly, and often
  preventable. Development of quality improvement programs to decrease the number
  and impact of AEs demands effective methods for screening for AEs on a routine
  basis. Here we describe the impact, types, and potential causes of AEs and
  review various techniques for identifying AEs. We evaluate the use of generic
  screening criteria in detail and describe a recent study of the sensitivity and
  specificity of individual generic screening criteria and combinations of these
  criteria. In general, the most sensitive screens were the least specific and no
  small sub-set of screens identified a large percentage of adverse events.
  Combinations of screens that were limited to administrative data were the least
  expensive, but none were particularly sensitive, although in practice they
  might be effective since routine screening is currently rarely done. As
  computer systems increase in sophistication sensitivity will improve. We also
  discuss recent studies that suggest that programs that screen for and identify
  AEs can be useful in reducing AE rates. While tools for identifying AEs have
  strengths and weaknesses, they can play an important role in organizations'
  quality improvement portfolios.

AB: The authors describe the growth from 1987 through 1996 of the Occupational
  Pesticide Poisoning Surveillance Program at the Texas Department of Health. The
  program was initially based on a Sentinel Event Notification System for
  Occupational Risks (SENSOR) model, using sentinel providers to report cases,
  supplementing the passive reporting by physicians that was required by law. The
  model was evaluated after five years, and significant changes were implemented
  to improve case ascertainment. Current active surveillance methods emphasize
  collaboration with a number of agencies and organizations for identification of
  cases and follow-up. The number of confirmed occupational cases increased from
  9 workers in 1987 to 99 workers in 1996. The evolution from a passive system to
  an active surveillance program expanded the number of reported cases and
  strengthened inter-agency collaborations.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To quantify plasma and urine nitric oxide (NO) concentrations
  before and after low-dose endotoxin infusion in horses. ANIMALS: 11 healthy
  adult female horses. Procedure-Eight horses were given endotoxin (35 ng/kg of
  body weight,i.v.) over 30 minutes. Three sentinel horses received an equivalent
  volume of saline (0.9% NaCl) solution over the same time. Clinical signs of
  disease and hemodynamic variables were recorded, and urine and plasma samples
  were obtained to measure NO concentrations prior to endotoxin infusion (t = 0)
  and every hour until postinfusion hour (PIH) 6, then every 2 hours until PIH
  24. Blood for hematologic and metabolic analyses and for serum cytokine
  bioassays were collected at 0 hour, every hour until PIH 6, every 2 hours
  through PIH 12, and finally, every 6 hours until PIH 24. RESULTS: Differences
  in plasma NO concentrations across time were not apparent, but urine NO
  concentrations significantly decreased at 4 and 20 to 24 hours in endotoxin
  -treated horses. Also in endotoxin-treated horses, alterations in clinical
  signs of disease, and hemodynamic, metabolic, and hematologic variables were
  significant and characteristic of endotoxemia. Serum interleukin-6 (IL-6)
  activity and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) concentrations were increased above
  baseline values from 1 to 8 hours and 1 to 2 hours, respectively. CONCLUSIONS
  AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Plasma and urine NO concentrations did not increase in
  horses after administration of a low dose of endotoxin, despite induction of an
  inflammatory response, which was confirmed by increased TNF and IL-6 values
  characteristic alterations in clinical signs of disease, and hematologic,
  hemodynamic and metabolic variables.

AB: BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that domestic violence is not only highly
  prevalent and associated with significant morbidity, but that it is also
  overlooked by medical practitioners. Despite this, few studies have focused on
  domestic violence in the South African setting, so that there is a paucity of
  data here on its prevalence, phenomenology, and associated psychopathology.
  METHODS: Sixteen general practitioners from the South African Sentinel
  Practitioner Research Network (SASPREN) screened all their female patients aged
  18 years or older for a 3-month period (N = 1,050). A sociodemographic
  questionnaire was completed, and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder
  (PTSD) and major depression were assessed, both in subjects with a history of
  domestic violence and in a control group without such a history. RESULTS: 21.5%
  of patients reported a history of domestic violence at screening. Patients and
  controls did not differ significantly in terms of age or race. However,
  patients with a history of domestic violence were significantly more likely to
  be married, not to have begun a high-school education, and to be working
  outside the home. Both PTSD and major depression were significantly more common
  in patients with a history of domestic violence (35.3% and 48.2%, respectively)
  than in controls (2.6% and 11.4%, respectively). Compared with other patients
  reporting domestic violence, those with either PTSD or major depression were
  subjected to more violence and were more likely to report a suicide attempt.
  CONCLUSION: In a large, diverse population of adult female patients presenting
  to a range of general practitioners in South Africa, there was a high
  prevalence of reported domestic violence. A significant association was found
  between domestic violence and both PTSD and major depression, with these
  diagnoses indicative of increased severity of abuse and increased morbidity.
  Routine screening by medical practitioners of all female patients for a history
  of domestic violence seems warranted, and patients with a history of domestic
  violence should be assessed for PTSD and depression.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To measure the prevalence of and trends in HIV infections in
  populations defined by sentinel surveillance in Vietnam. METHODS: Surveillance
  was conducted in eight provinces in 1994, expanded to 12 in 1995 and to 20 in
  1996. Sentinel populations were sexually transmitted disease (STD) patients,
  female sex workers (FSW), injecting drug users (IDU), tuberculosis (TB)
  patients, pregnant women, and military conscripts. Samples were collected twice
  yearly for high-risk populations and once yearly for low-risk populations.
  RESULTS: The overall HIV epidemic in Vietnam comprises several different
  smaller epidemics. It is primarily associated with injecting drug use, but its
  extent varies widely throughout the country. In 1998, HIV prevalence rates
  ranged from 0 to 85% (median, 13.1%), with an aggregate prevalence rate (APR;
  i.e., the sum of HIV-positive study subjects divided by the sum of all study
  subjects tested in sentinel provinces) of 17% among IDUs; this ranged from 0 to
  14.7% (median, 0.8%), with the APR of 2.4% among FSWs; and from 0 to 6%
  (median, 0%), with the APR of 0.9% among STD patients. The APRs among antenatal
  women and army conscripts were less than 0.15%. APRs increased significantly
  from 1994 to 1998 among STD patients (p

AB: This paper examines the requirement for health surveillance systems for
  military forces. Military health surveillance is the routine systematic
  collection, analysis, interpretation, and reporting of standardised, population
  based data for the purpose of characterising and countering threats to the
  military population's health, well-being and performance. The components of a
  health surveillance system should enable concurrent or retrospective analysis
  of health effects in military personnel using a cohort study design. Military
  hazards include trauma, infection, toxic effects, radiation, psychological
  stress and ergonomic stress. Variations in distribution of the hazard,
  distribution of the population, fragility of the cohort, and the variation in
  the duration and magnitude of exposure complicate definition of the exposed
  cohort. The measurement of biological effect is complicated by limits in
  knowledge about the relationship between exposure to the hazard and effect. A
  biological model that explains detection, causality, pathological process and
  health effect should support this knowledge. Lastly the definition of health
  effect needs to consider the difference between clinical activity rates and
  true measures of health outcome. The UK has a number of health surveillance
  systems including sentinel reporting, a population-based primary care reporting
  system and measures of medical discharge and death. The US Army is developing
  IT-based surveillance systems to link hazard, personnel and medical databases.
  The paper suggests a conceptual model for such a system in the UK military.

  peaked in August in the same habitat type (6.0, 4-17/50 m dragging). Prevalence
  of I. ricinus infestation was 88.9% in wild rodents (n = 11), 64.3% in fallow
  deer (n = 28) and 0.0% in wild boars (n = 5). Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato
  was not isolated from rodents' organs, and from 80 I. ricinus nymphs and 50
  adults. Moreover, PCR for B. burgdorferi sl carried out on 110 nymphs and 12
  adult ticks also gave negative results. Forest workers were at higher risk of
  tick bite than other Estate employees (relative risk (RR): 1.7, p = 0.02). In
  spite of high levels of tick exposure, B. burgdorferi sl specific antibodies
  were not detected in sera from Estate personnel (n = 30) and sentinel animals
  (dogs, n = 23, fallow deer, n = 61).

AB: The results of an environmental mutation and teratologic epidemiological
  study are presented which was performed in inhabitants living in the
  surrounding region of an acrylonitrile factory in Nyergesujfalu. The endpoint
  of the study was congenital abnormalities in 46,326 infants born to mothers
  living in the 30 settlements of the study region within a 25 km radius of the
  acrylonitrile factory between 1980 and 1996. The ascertainment of cases with
  congenital abnormalities was based on the dataset of the Hungarian Congenital
  Abnormality Registry complemented with the review of pediatric, pathology and
  cytogenetic records. A particular attention was paid to the indicators of
  germinal mutations as sentinel anomalies, Down syndrome and unidentified
  multiple congenital abnormalities and the indicators of teratogens as the
  specific pattern of multiple congenital abnormalities. Three congenital
  abnormalities: pectus excavatum in Tata, 1990-1992 (OR with 95%CI: 78.5, 8.4
  -729.6), undescended testis in Nyergesujfalu between 1980 and 1983 (8.6, 1.4
  -54.3) and in Esztergom, 1981-1982 (4. 2, 1.3-13.5) and clubfoot in Tata, 1980
  -1981 (5.5, 1.5-20.3) showed significant time-space clusters in the study
  region. There was a decrease in risk of undescended testis with increasing
  distance from the acrylonitrile factory. An unusual increase was found in the
  combination of oral cleft and cardiac septal defects in multimalformed babies
  in Tatabanya, 1990. The detailed analysis of congenital abnormalities in all
  settlements of a given territory may help to detect clusters of congenital
  abnormalities and their possible relation to the environmental hazards.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence and prognostic significance of
  documented eradication of breast cancer axillary lymph node (ALN) metastases
  after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Neoadjuvant
  chemotherapy is the standard of care for patients with locally advanced breast
  cancer and is being evaluated in patients with earlier-stage operable disease.
  METHODS: One hundred ninety-one patients with locally advanced breast cancer
  and cytologically documented ALN metastases were treated in two prospective
  trials of doxorubicin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients had breast
  surgery with level I and II axillary dissection followed by additional
  chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Nodal sections from 43 patients who were
  originally identified as having negative ALNs at surgery were reevaluated and
  histologically confirmed to be without metastases. An additional 1112 sections
  from these lymph node blocks were obtained; half were stained with an
  anticytokeratin antibody cocktail and analyzed. Survival was calculated using
  the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Of 191 patients with positive ALNs at
  diagnosis, 23% (43 patients) were converted to a negative axillary nodal status
  on histologic examination (median number of nodes removed = 16). Of the 43
  patients with complete axillary conversion, 26% (n = 11) had N1 disease and 74%
  (n = 32) had N2 disease. On univariate analysis, patients with complete versus
  incomplete histologic axillary conversion were more likely to have initial
  estrogen-receptor-negative tumors, smaller primary tumors, and a complete
  pathologic response in the primary tumor. The 5-year disease-free survival
  rates were 87% in patients with preoperative eradication of axillary metastases
  and 51% for patients with residual nodal disease after neoadjuvant
  chemotherapy. Of the 39 patients with complete histologic conversion for whom
  nodal blocks were available, occult nodal metastases were found in additional
  nodal sections in 4 patients (10%). At a median follow-up of 61 months, the 5
  -year disease-free survival rates were 87% in patients without occult nodal
  metastases and 75% in patients with occult nodal metastases. CONCLUSIONS:
  Neoadjuvant chemotherapy can completely clear the axilla of microscopic disease
  before surgery, and occult metastases are found in only 10% of patients with a
  histologically negative axilla. The results of this study have implications for
  the potential use of sentinel lymph node biopsy as an alternative to axillary
  dissection in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

AB: BACKGROUND: The success of intraoperative lymphatic mapping depends on
  accurate identification of the sentinel node. We hypothesized that a carbon
  particle suspension would allow histopathologic confirmation of the sentinel
  lymph node through deposition of carbon within that node. METHODS: An animal
  model was used to compare the lymphatic mapping accuracy of carbon dye with
  that of isosulfan blue dye, the standard agent for intraoperative visualization
  of the sentinel lymph node. Twenty-two rats underwent lymphatic mapping in each
  distal lower extremity with various combinations of carbon dye and isosulfan
  blue dye. All stained (blue or black) nodes in the inguinal drainage basin were
  removed for pathologic analysis, including carbon particle analysis. A
  meticulous search identified all nonstained (nonsentinel) nodes in the same
  basin. These nonsentinel nodes were examined for carbon particles by light
  microscopy. Dermal diffusion of mapping agents at the injection site was also
  recorded. Animals were then observed for 28 days to assess the toxicity of
  mapping agents. RESULTS: Although isosulfan blue dye and full-strength carbon
  dye each stained all sentinel nodes, the latter obscured histologic detail. The
  combination of 2.5% carbon dye, 7.5% saline solution, and 90% isosulfan blue
  dye also stained all sentinel nodes; carbon particles were seen on light
  microscopy in all 13 stained nodes and did not interfere with histologic
  evaluation. No unstained node contained carbon particles, although the number
  of nonsentinel nodes was small. Carbon dye exhibited significantly less
  intradermal diffusion than isosulfan blue dye, but the carbon left a permanent
  mark on the skin. No toxicity or side effect associated with the use of carbon
  dye was observed. CONCLUSION: Carbon dye allows histopathologic confirmation of
  sentinel lymph nodes identified by isosulfan blue dye.

AB: PROBLEM/CONDITION: Cases of work-related asthma (WRA) are sentinel health
  events that indicate the need for preventive intervention. WRA includes new
  -onset asthma caused by workplace exposure to sensitizers or irritants and
  preexisting asthma exacerbated by workplace exposures. REPORTING PERIOD: This
  report reviews cases of WRA identified by state health departments from January
  1, 1993, through December 31, 1995, as well as follow-up investigations of
  cases and associated workplaces conducted through June 30, 1998. DESCRIPTION OF
  THE SYSTEMS: State-based surveillance and intervention programs for WRA are
  conducted in California, Massachusetts, Michigan, and New Jersey as part of the
  Sentinel Event Notification Systems for Occupational Risks (SENSOR) cooperative
  agreement program, initiated by CDC's National Institute for Occupational
  Safety and Health (NIOSH). RESULTS: From 1993 through 1995, a total of 1,101
  cases of WRA were identified by SENSOR surveillance staff members in
  California, Massachusetts, Michigan, and New Jersey. Of these 1,101 cases,
  19.1% were classified as work-aggravated asthma, and 80.9% were classified as
  new-onset asthma. Objective evidence substantiating asthma work-relatedness was
  documented in the medical records of 3.4% of WRA cases identified in the two
  states (Michigan and New Jersey) where medical records are routinely reviewed
  for this information. Indoor air pollutants, dusts, cleaning materials,
  lubricants (e.g., metalworking fluids), and diisocyanates were among the most
  frequently reported causes of WRA. In addition, a well-recognized cause of
  occupational asthma - natural rubber latex - was identified in a new setting,
  the healthcare industry. The most common industries associated with WRA cases
  included transportation equipment manufacturing (19.3%), health services
  (14.2%), and educational services (8.7%). Air sampling for agents known to
  induce occupational asthma was performed in Michigan for comparison with
  established federal time-weighted average exposure limits. Sixteen (13.4%) of
  119 workplaces tested had airborne concentrations exceeding NIOSH recommended
  exposure limits (RELs); 11 (9.1%) of 121 workplaces had concentrations
  exceeding permissible exposure limits (PELs) of the Michigan Occupational
  Safety and Health Act (MIOSHA) program. INTERPRETATION: The surveillance data
  findings confirm well-recognized causes of asthma and have identified new
  putative causes (e.g., cleaning materials and metalworking fluids). Because the
  surveillance program depends on physicians' recognizing asthma work-relatedness
  and reporting diagnosed cases, the data are considered an underestimate of the
  magnitude of the WRA problem. The data also indicate that physicians are not
  commonly performing objective physiologic tests to substantiate a WRA
  diagnosis. Workplace findings suggest a need to evaluate existing exposure
  standards for specific agents known to induce occupational asthma (e.g.,
  diisocyanates). Case-based surveillance can help improve the recognition,
  control, and prevention of WRA. The SENSOR model also provides a mechanism for
  workers and physicians to request workplace investigations aimed at primary
  prevention for other workers. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: NIOSH and state health
  department representatives are working to establish a long-term agenda for
  state-based surveillance of work-related conditions and hazards. The results
  from the SENSOR WRA programs described in this report support inclusion of WRA
  as a priority condition warranting surveillance at the state level.

AB: Heavy metals are stable and persistent environmental contaminants. The range
  of metal concentrations is generally below acute thresholds in coastal areas,
  where recognition of chronic sublethal effects is more relevant. Evidence of
  long-term adverse effects, such as cancer, due to heavy metals in marine
  animals comes from a number of field and experimental studies. The mechanism of
  metal carcinogenicity remains largely unknown, although several lines of
  experimental evidence suggest that a genotoxic effect may be involved. The aim
  of our study was to evaluate the sensitivity of genotoxicity tests, alkaline
  elution and micronucleus test, as biomarkers for the detection of heavy metals
  in mussels as the sentinel species. Experimental studies were carried out on
  Mytilus galloprovincialis exposed in aquarium (5 days) to different
  concentrations of three selected metal salts, CuCl2 (5, 10, 20, 40, 80
  micrograms/l/a), CdCl2 (1.84, 18.4, 184 micrograms/l/a), and HgCl2 (32
  micrograms/l/a), and to a mixture of equimolar doses of the three metals to
  study the results of their joint action. Metallothionein quantitation was used
  as a marker of metal exposure. Lysosomal membrane stability was applied to
  evaluate the influence of physiological status on genotoxic damage. The ranking
  of genotoxic potential was in decreasing order: Hg > Cu > Cd. Cu and Hg caused
  an increase of DNA single-strand breaks and micronuclei frequency. Cd induced a
  statistical increase of DNA damage, but gave negative results with the
  micronucleus test. A relationship between genotoxic effects and metallothionein
  content was observed. Reduction in lysosomal membrane stability with the
  increasing concentration of heavy metals was also evident.

AB: OBJECTIVES: 1) To describe patterns of unintentional injury presenting for
  emergency medical care in Kingston, Ontario following the ice storm in January
  1998; and 2) to provide recommendations for prevention during such situations.
  METHODS: Unintentional injuries related to the ice storm that presented at the
  two emergency departments in Kingston, Ontario were identified and described.
  RESULTS: A total of 254 injuries were identified. Injuries peaked the day
  following the onset of the ice storm and again 4-6 days following the storm.
  Common sources of injury included slips and falls on the ice (56%), activities
  related to clearing brush or trees (15%), and unintentional carbon monoxide
  poisonings (9%). CONCLUSIONS: While the number of injuries that presented
  during the storm and its aftermath was not unusual, the distribution of
  injuries by type did reflect the irregular nature of environmental conditions.
  This analysis provides useful information for public officials to use reviewing
  disaster plans and to generate recommendations for managing future occurrences.

  -dibromo-3-chloropropane (DBCP) are reviewed. The sentinel event was the
  discovery of infertility in male pesticide manufacturing workers. In spite of
  early evidence of testicular damage, first in laboratory animals and later in
  humans, DBCP has been widely used as a nematocide in the United States and is
  still used in other countries. The spermatogenic effects of DBCP are usually
  irreversible, and there is also evidence of toxicity to the female reproductive
  system. DBCP is also a CNS depressant, a liver and kidney toxin, and a skin,
  eye, and respiratory irritant, and is probably carcinogenic. Environmental
  contamination of air and water may be an additional source of exposure.
  Materials often used to protect workers from toxic chemicals are not being
  deployed for use by exposed workers, and in any case are relatively ineffective.

AB: A small-volume sentinel chamber was developed to assess the effects of
  environmental stresses on survival of sucrose-Percoll-purified Cryptosporidium
  parvum oocysts in soil and animal wastes. Chambers were tested for their
  ability to equilibrate with external chemical and moisture conditions. Sentinel
  oocysts were then exposed to stresses of the external environment that affected
  their viability (potential infectivity), as indicated by results of a dye
  permeability assay. Preliminary laboratory experiments indicated that
  temperatures between 35 and 50 degrees C and decreases in soil water potential
  (-0.003 to -3.20 MPa) increased oocyst inactivation rates. The effects of two
  common animal waste management practices on oocyst survival were investigated
  on three dairy farms in Delaware County, N.Y., within the New York City
  watershed: (i) piling wastes from dairy youngstock (including neonatal calves)
  and (ii) spreading wastes as a soil amendment on an agricultural field.
  Sentinel containers filled with air-dried and sieved (2-mm mesh) youngstock
  waste or field soil were wetted and inoculated with 2 million oocysts in an
  aqueous suspension and then placed in waste piles on two different farms and in
  soil within a cropped field on one farm. Controls consisted of purified oocysts
  in either phosphate-buffered saline or distilled water contained in sealed
  microcentrifuge tubes. Two microdata loggers recorded the ambient temperature
  at each field site. Sentinel experiments were conducted during the fall and
  winter (1996 to 1997) and winter (1998). Sentinel containers and controls were
  removed at 2- to 4-week intervals, and oocysts were extracted and tested by the
  dye permeability assay. The proportions of potentially infective oocysts
  exposed to the soil and waste pile material decreased more rapidly than their
  counterpart controls exposed to buffer or water, indicating that factors other
  than temperature affected oocyst inactivation in the waste piles and soil. The
  effect of soil freeze-thaw cycles was evident in the large proportion of empty
  sentinel oocysts. The potentially infective sentinel oocysts were reduced to

AB: The results of recently completed trials in Africa of insecticide-treated
  bed nets (ITBN) offer new possibilities for malaria control. These experimental
  trials aimed for high ITBN coverage combined with high re-treatment rates.
  Whilst necessary to understand protective efficacy, the approaches used to
  deliver the intervention provide few indications of what coverage of net re
  -treatment would be under operational conditions. Varied delivery and financing
  strategies have been proposed for the sustainable delivery of ITBNs and re
  -treatment programmes. Following the completion of a randomized, controlled
  trial on the Kenyan coast, a series of suitable delivery strategies were used
  to continue net re-treatment in the area. The trial adopted a bi-annual, house
  -to-house re-treatment schedule free of charge using research project staff and
  resulted in over 95% coverage of nets issued to children. During the year
  following the trial, sentinel dipping stations were situated throughout the
  community and household members informed of their position and opening times.
  This free re-treatment service achieved between 61-67% coverage of nets used by
  children for three years. In 1997 a social marketing approach, that introduced
  cost-retrieval, was used to deliver the net re-treatment services. The
  immediate result of this transition was that significantly fewer of the mothers
  who had used the previous re-treatment services adopted this revised approach
  and coverage declined to 7%. The future of new delivery services and their
  financing are discussed in the context of their likely impact upon previously
  defined protective efficacy and cost-effectiveness estimates.

AB: Free-ranging wildlife is regularly exposed to pesticides and can serve as a
  sentinel for human and environmental health. Therefore a comprehensive
  pesticide hazard assessment must incorporate the effects of actual applications
  on free-ranging wildlife. Mortality is the most readily reported wildlife
  effect, and the significance of these data can be realized only when placed in
  context with the factors that affect the gathering of this type of information.
  This paper reviews the variables that affect the collection of wildlife
  mortality data. Data show that most effects on wildlife are not observed, and
  much of observed mortality is not reported. Delays in reporting or in the
  response to a report and exposure to multiple stressors distort the exposure
  -effect relationship and can result in uncertainty in determining the cause of
  death. The synthesis of information strongly indicates that the actual number
  of affected animals exceeds the number recovered.

AB: A workshop titled "Using Sentinel Species Data to Address the Potential
  Human Health Effects of Chemicals in the Environment," sponsored by the U.S.
  Army Center for Environmental Health Research, the National Center for
  Environmental Assessment of the EPA, and the Agency for Toxic Substances and
  Disease Registry, was held to consider the use of sentinel and surrogate animal
  species data for evaluating the potential human health effects of chemicals in
  the environment. The workshop took a broad view of the sentinel species
  concept, and included mammalian and nonmammalian species, companion animals,
  food animals, fish, amphibians, and other wildlife. Sentinel species data
  included observations of wild animals in field situations as well as
  experimental animal data. Workshop participants identified potential
  applications for sentinel species data derived from monitoring programs or
  serendipitous observations and explored the potential use of such information
  in human health hazard and risk assessments and for evaluating causes or
  mechanisms of effect. Although it is unlikely that sentinel species data will
  be used as the sole determinative factor in evaluating human health concerns,
  such data can be useful as for additional weight of evidence in a risk
  assessment, for providing early warning of situations requiring further study,
  or for monitoring the course of remedial activities. Attention was given to the
  factors impeding the application of sentinel species approaches and their
  acceptance in the scientific and regulatory communities. Workshop participants
  identified a number of critical research needs and opportunities for
  interagency collaboration that could help advance the use of sentinel species
  approaches.

AB: A voluntary, anonymous incident-monitoring study was set up to identify and
  characterize events or circumstances which could have or did harm a patient in
  general practice. The study included 673 practitioners who made 2582 reports,
  of which half (n = 1294) involved medication problems. Amongst these reports,
  1556 adverse drug events (ADE) were identified. More common in general practice
  than in hospitals were problems with therapeutic use (26% vs. 8%), and
  prescribing of contraindicated medications (15% vs. 5%). In the latter group,
  64 reports (4%) involved the prescription of a medication to which the patient
  was known to be allergic, 66 (4%) involved medication for which there was a
  recognized potential for a drug interaction, and 68 (4%) involved
  contraindicated medications due to pathophysiological factors. It was estimated
  that computer-based prescribing with decision support could eliminate at least
  a third of these problems in general practice. Further studies are needed to
  develop this and other preventive strategies.

AB: Previous research has shown that there is a high error rate associated with
  medication use, resulting in significant patient morbidity and mortality, as
  well as increasing health care costs. Analysis of available Australian data on
  adverse drug events shows that incident monitoring and retrospective medical
  record review provide different, but complementary 'windows' into the errors
  that occur. While retrospective medical record review provides information on
  the frequency of specific adverse drug events, incident monitoring gives an
  insight into the contributing factors. From this information, priorities can be
  set and preventative strategies can be developed.

AB: BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping is an effective and accurate
  method of axillary nodal evaluation for metastatic disease. Cytokeratin (CK)
  immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of the SLN has found micrometastatic disease
  previously undetected by routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stains. The
  purpose of this study is to determine the number of patients who were upstaged
  or microstaged, i.e., detected to have micrometastatic disease only by combined
  lymphatic mapping with CK IHC. METHODS: Two hundred and ten patients with newly
  diagnosed breast cancer underwent intraoperative lymphatic mapping using a
  combination of vital blue dye and technetium-labeled sulfur colloid. The
  excised sentinel lymph nodes were examined grossly, by imprint cytology, by
  standard H&E histology, and by IHC stains for CK. SLNs that were only CK
  positive were confirmed to be malignant by histologic examination. RESULTS: CK
  IHC staining was performed on 381 SLNs in 210 breast cancer patients. Forty
  -seven of 210 patients (22.4%) had positive nodes. Thirty of these 47 patients
  (63.8%) had both H&E- and CK-positive SLNs, and an additional 17 of the 47
  positive patients (36.2%) had only CK-positive SLNs. Seventeen of the 180
  patients (9.4%) who were negative on H&E staining were upstaged by CK IHC
  staining of malignant cells in the SLN. Comparison of tumor size with the total
  number of node-positive patients demonstrated that 16 of 30 node-positive T0
  and T1 patients (53.5%) and 22 of 39 nodes (56.4%) were upstaged by CK IHC
  staining. T2 and T3 patients were less frequently upstaged by cytokeratin
  analysis of lymph nodes. Only one of 17 node-positive patients (5.9%) and seven
  of 34 nodes (20.6%) in patients with T2 and T3 tumors were upstaged.
  CONCLUSION: CK IHC staining of SLNs shifted 9.4% of patients from stage I to
  stage II. There was a significant upstaging influence noted in patients with
  tumor sizes under 2 cm. This microstaging shift or upstaging may account for
  the significant proportion of stage I breast cancer treatment failures.
  Microstaging of the SLNs using more sensitive assays may help identify a
  subgroup of patients with invasive breast cancer who would benefit from
  systemic adjuvant treatment, while sparing a disease-free subset of patients
  the additional risks of toxic adjuvant chemotherapy.

AB: BACKGROUND: Several reports have demonstrated accurate prediction of nodal
  metastasis with radiolocalization and selective resection of the radiolocalized
  sentinel lymph node (SLN) in patients with breast cancer and melanoma. As
  reliance on this technique grows, its use by those without experience in
  radiation safety will increase. METHODS: Tissue obtained during radioguided SLN
  biopsies was examined for residual radioactivity. Specimens with a specific
  activity greater than the radiologic control level (RCL) of 0.002 microCi/g
  were considered radioactive. Radiation exposure to the surgical team was
  measured. RESULTS: A total of 24 primary tissue specimens and 318 lymph nodes
  were obtained during 57 operations (37 for breast cancer, 20 for melanoma). All
  24 (100%) of the specimens injected with radiopharmaceutical and 89 of 98 (91%)
  of the localized nodes were radioactive after surgery. Activity fell below the
  RCL 71+/-3.6 hours in primary tissue specimens, 46+/-1.7 hours in nodes from
  melanoma patients, and 33+/-3.5 hours in nodes from breast cancer patients (P =
  .037). The hands of the surgical team (n = 22 cases) were exposed to 9.4+/-3.6
  mrem/case. CONCLUSION: Although low levels of radiation exposure are associated
  with radiolocalization and resection of the SLN, the presented guidelines
  ensure conformity to existing regulations and allow timely pathologic analysis.

AB: BACKGROUND: Axillary lymph node dissection is an established component of
  the surgical treatment of breast cancer, and is an important procedure in
  cancer staging; however, it is associated with unpleasant side effects. We have
  investigated a radioactive tracer-guided procedure that facilitates
  identification, removal, and pathologic examination of the sentinel lymph node
  (i.e., the lymph node first receiving lymphatic fluid from the area of the
  breast containing the tumor) to predict the status of the axilla and to assess
  the safety of foregoing axillary dissection if the sentinel lymph node shows no
  involvement. METHODS: We injected 5-10 MBq of 99mTc-labeled colloidal particles
  of human albumin peritumorally in 376 consecutive patients with breast cancer
  who were enrolled at the European Institute of Oncology during the period from
  March 1996 through March 1998. The sentinel lymph node in each case was
  visualized by lymphoscintigraphy, and its general location was marked on the
  overlying skin. During breast surgery, the sentinel lymph node was identified
  for removal by monitoring the acoustic signal from a hand-held gamma ray
  -detecting probe. Total axillary dissection was then carried out. The
  pathologic status of the sentinel lymph node was compared with that of the
  whole axilla. RESULTS: The sentinel lymph node was identified in 371 (98.7%) of
  the 376 patients and accurately predicted the state of the axilla in 359
  (95.5%) of the patients, with 12 false-negative findings (6.7%; 95% confidence
  interval = 3.5%-11.4%) among a total of 180 patients with positive axillary
  lymph nodes. CONCLUSIONS: Sentinel lymph node biopsy using a gamma ray
  -detecting probe allows staging of the axilla with high accuracy in patients
  with primary breast cancer. A randomized trial is necessary to determine
  whether axillary dissection may be avoided in those patients with an uninvolved
  sentinel lymph node.

AB: This study investigates the effects of hydrogen peroxide, a potent oxygen
  free radical donor, on the phenotype and function of dendritic cells
  differentiated from peripheral blood precursors. We report that hydrogen
  peroxide induces an up-regulation of several dendritic cell surface markers
  involved in interaction with T cells, including MHC Class II molecules (DQ and
  DR) and the co-stimulatory molecules CD40 and CD86. Moreover we have observed
  that H2O2-treated dendritic cells are more efficient in promoting T cell
  proliferation than normal dendritic cells and that this enhancement can be
  blocked using the free radical scavenger agent N-acetylcysteine. Oxygen free
  radicals are a common by-product of inflammation, and our results suggest they
  may play an important role in activation of sentinel dendritic cells, linking
  tissue damage to the initiation of an adaptive immune response.

AB: The general objective of our work was to propose new reference material for
  chemical toxicity testing and new sentinel organisms for environmental quality
  survey programs (freshwater or soils). We also wanted to provide basic
  toxicological data on the environmental effects of uranium. Thus, we conducted
  a comparative study to establish the acute toxicity and toxicokinetics of lead
  (Pb) and uranium (U) to the bivalve mollusc Corbicula fluminea and the
  terrestrial annelid Eisenia fetida andrei and to compare these findings with
  those of the well-known teleost fish Brachydanio rerio. We then measured the
  concentration of these metals in various tissues of the clam and the worm after
  two periods of exposure (4 and 11 days) to identify the affinities of these
  tissues for Pb and U. Our results have shown that Pb and U are very toxic to
  Eisenia and relatively nontoxic to Corbicula. By comparison, Pb was relatively
  nontoxic and U appeared to be very toxic to the fish. The toxicokinetic studies
  indicated that the three species are able to accumulate Pb and U, the rate and
  level of accumulation depending both on the species and the metal. We also
  found that fish and clams depurate the two metals. Data collected for the worm
  were conflicting: Pb was not depurated whereas tissue concentrations of U
  declined after the eighth day of exposure. Our study has also shown that the
  tissue distribution of Pb in the mollusc and in the earthworm differs
  significantly from that of U, both after 4 and 11 days exposure. In conclusion,
  these three species showed potential as bioindicators of environmental
  contamination by metals. Indeed, they could be used in conjunction to test
  different compartments of an ecosystem: worms for soils, fish for the water
  column, and clams for the water/sediment interface.

AB: A major goal for genetic toxicologist is to provide precise information on
  exposure and health risk assessment for effective prevention of health
  problems. A frequently used approach for population study has been to utilize
  readily available blood cells (lymphocytes and red blood cells) as sentinel
  cell types to detect biological effects from exposure and to provide early
  warning signals for health risk. However, such approach still cannot be used
  reliably for developing strategies in risk assessment and disease prevention.
  It is possible that other available cell types which are more representative of
  the target cells for disease may be used to overcome the deficiency. In this
  report, the use of non-blood cells for biomonitoring is briefly reviewed. Their
  usefulness in certain exposure condition is highlighted and their effectiveness
  in documenting exposure compared with other cell types such as the traditional
  blood cells is presented. It is obvious that the decision in using these non
  -blood cells in biomonitoring is based on the exposure condition and the
  experimental design. Nevertheless, monitoring studies using non-blood cells
  should be encouraged with emphasis on providing dose-response information,
  comparative response with other cell types and effectiveness for health risk
  assessment.

AB: Results of a monitoring system established in the USA in 1996 by the Centers
  for Disease Prevention and Control, USDA and the FDA Center for Veterinary
  Medicine to record changes in antimicrobial susceptibility of zoonotic
  pathogens in specimens obtained from ill humans and animals, healthy farm
  animals and animal carcasses at slaughter are reported. Non-typhoid Salmonella
  was selected as the sentinel organism. Information from the programme is
  intended to be used in redirecting drug use to diminsh development of
  resistance. In 1997, 65.7% of all isolates (2391 in total) were susceptible to
  all antimicrobial agents tested and 11.1% were resistant to `sw5 antibiotics.
  The multiple drug resistant strain S. typhimurium DT104 was also detected (1.5%
  of total isolates). It is concluded that appropriate and prudent use of
  antimicrobials by physicians and veterinarians is required to prolong the
  therapeutic efficacy of these agents and minimize the risk of zoonotic
  transmission of pathogens. [Abstracts of further papers presented at this

AB: To determine the contaminants that should be studied further in the
  subsequent population-based study, a profile of Great Lakes (GL) sport fish
  contaminant residues were studied in human blood and urine specimens from 32
  sport fish consumers from three Great Lakes: Lake Michigan (n = 10), Lake Huron
  (n = 11), and Lake Erie (n = 11). Serum was analyzed for 8 polychlorinated
  dioxin congeners, 10 polychlorinated furan congeners, 4 coplanar and 32 other
  polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners, and 11 persistent chlorinated
  pesticides. Whole blood was analyzed for mercury and lead. Urine samples were
  analyzed for 10 nonpersistent pesticides (or their metabolites) and 5 metals.
  One individual was excluded from statistical analysis because of an unusual
  exposure to selected analytes. Overall, the sample (n = 31) consumed, on
  average, 49 GL sport fish per year for a mean of 33 years. On average, the
  general population in the GL basin consume 6 meals of GL sport fish per year.
  The mean tissue levels of most persistent, bioaccumulative compounds also found
  in GL sport fish ranged from less than a twofold increase to that of PCB 126,
  which was eight times the selected background levels found in the general
  population. The overall mean total toxic equivalent for dioxins, furans, and
  coplanar PCBs were greater than selected background levels in the general
  population (dioxins, 1.8 times; furans, 2.4 times; and coplanar PCBs, 9.6
  times). The nonpersistent pesticides and most metals were not identified in
  unusual concentrations. A contaminant pattern among lake subgroups was evident.
  Lake Erie sport fish consumers had consistently lower contaminant
  concentrations than consumers of sport fish from Lakes Michigan and Huron.
  These interlake differences are consistent with contaminant patterns seen in
  sport fish tissue from the respective lakes; GL sport fish consumption was the
  most likely explanation for observed contaminant levels among this sample.
  Frequent consumers of sport fish proved to be effective sentinels for
  identifying sport fish contaminants of concern. In the larger study to follow,
  serum samples will be tested for PCBs (congener specific and coplanar), DDE,
  dioxin, and furans.

AB: To further evaluate the suitability of small fish species for sentinel
  monitoring, a comparison was made between the responses of trout-perch
  (Percopsis omiscomaycus) and the larger white sucker (Catostomus commersoni)
  under similar conditions of pulp mill effluent exposure and mobility. Fish were
  collected upstream and downstream of a thermomechanical pulp mill on the
  Kapuskasing River, Ontario, Canada, where the presence of a hydro dam restricts
  the movement of fish between reference and exposure areas. Trout-perch
  collected downstream of the mill were shorter, lighter, and younger than
  upstream fish, whereas exposed white sucker were longer, heavier, and, for male
  sucker, older than reference fish. Only male trout-perch showed induced hepatic
  mixed function oxygenase activity (7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase). Both
  forskolin-stimulated in vitro production of 17 beta -estradiol in trout-perch
  and plasma concentrations of 17 beta -estradiol in sucker were significantly
  depressed in exposed fish. The inconsistency in responses between species made
  it difficult to determine how the opposing responses were related and which
  species was most sensitive to instream conditions. Despite the discrepancies,
  use of an interpretation framework indicated that both species identified
  similar potential problems (e.g., size-selective mortality and recruitment
  problems), suggesting that either species could be used as a sentinel species
  at this site.

AB: Larger fish species may not always be suitable for monitoring the response
  to industrial effluents because they are mobile and capable of extensive
  movement beyond effluent exposure areas. Spoonhead sculpin (Cottus ricei) was
  collected upstream and downstream of a large bleached-kraft pulp mill on the
  Athabasca River, Alberta, Canada, during fall and spring periods to determine
  whether small, sedentary fish species demonstrate responses reflecting local
  exposure conditions. During the fall sampling period, exposed fish were older
  and larger than upstream fish and showed increases in condition, gonad size,
  egg weight, liver weight, and hepatic mixed function oxygenase activity (7
  -ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase [EROD]). Sculpin collected from the opposite
  river bank, where exposure was reduced, showed condition factors, gonad size,
  egg weight, liver weight, and EROD activity that were not significantly
  different from reference sites or intermediate between reference and downstream
  values. In the spring after a prolonged overwinter exposure to higher effluent
  concentrations, exposed fish were larger, showed increased size-at-age,
  condition, liver weight, ovary size, and EROD activity. Far-field collections
  showed that most responses persisted downstream for at least 48 km. The general
  response of exposed spoonhead sculpin was consistent with a nutrient enrichment
  effect described in studies investigating water quality, algal growth, and
  benthos communities at this site but also may be related to reduced competition
  associated with the loss of older fish observed in the spring. The use of small
  species for sentinel monitoring provided a viable alternative to use of larger,
  more mobile species.

AB: Asthma is a common chronic illness characterized by episodes of reversible
  airflow obstruction. A cornerstone of asthma management is identifying and
  avoiding agents that cause bronchospasm. The workplace is an important
  potential source of respirable exposures that can cause or trigger asthma.
  Identification of an occupational factor in asthma is important: early
  diagnosis and removal of the worker from the exposure is associated with
  improved prognosis; the diagnosis of occupational asthma may lead to
  compensation for work-related impairment and disability; and the diagnosis of
  occupational asthma is a Sentinel Health Event with implications for public
  health and prevention. In this article, we review specific causes of
  occupational asthma and general settings in which an occupational factor should
  be suspected and explored as part of the management of the worker with asthma.
  We also review specific and simple elements of history and pulmonary function
  testing that can be easily assessed by most health care practitioners and may
  be sufficient to establish a diagnosis of occupational asthma. Finally, we
  review the medical-legal implications of occupational asthma.

AB: Through the efforts of different laboratories, a battery of immunological
  assays is available to predict the immunotoxicity of xenobiotics. These assays,
  originally developed in rodents, have been adapted for use in a variety of
  animal species and are now used routinely in these models to assess the
  immunotoxicity of different chemical classes. For example, our laboratory has
  employed assays that measure antibody-forming cell response to T-dependent
  antigens, T- and B-cell lymphoproliferation, macrophage function, and host
  resistance against infectious bacteria to assess metal-induced immunotoxicity
  in laboratory-reared Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes); immunologically-related
  assays measuring antioxidant activity have also been used in this capacity.
  Results of the aforementioned investigations have shown the usefulness of these
  endpoints to reliably demonstrate chemical-mediated immunotoxicity in teleost
  systems. Many of these same endpoints have also proved successful for
  predicting the immunotoxic effects of contaminated aquatic environments in
  feral fish populations. For example, smallmouth bass collected from a
  chlorinated hydrocarbon-contaminated site demonstrated significant changes in
  blood cell profiles and kidney phagocyte function compared to fish collected
  from a `clean water' reference site. Some of these same immune parameters have
  also been used successfully to predict the immunotoxicity of polluted aquatic
  environments in feral populations of fish-eating birds and harbor seals. While
  interspecies extrapolation is difficult and should be approached with caution
  due to variables such as metabolism and pharmacokinetics, results from these
  studies demonstrate the usefulness of these immune assays to predict the
  immunomodulating effects of xenobiotics in fish and other wildlife species, as
  well as the applicability of fish to serve as additional/alternate animal
  models for mammalian species in immunotoxicological studies.

AB: A wide range of chemicals, particulate matter, and gaseous air pollutants
  are present in urban atmospheres and may pose a significant health risk for
  human populations. Nasal passages are the first site of contact of the
  respiratory tract with the environment and offer significant protection to the
  lower respiratory tract by conditioning the inspired air. This activity, which
  includes removal of certain pollutants, places the nose at risk of pathological
  changes, including cancer. Mexico City residents are exposed to a complex
  mixture of air pollutants. Based on predicted nasal air flow characteristics,
  four nasal biopsy sites were selected for study in adult male volunteers from a
  control low polluted town (n = 12) and southwest metropolitan Mexico City
  permanent residents (n = 54). Clinical data with emphasis on nasal symptoms and
  histopathological changes including basal and goblet cell hyperplasia, squamous
  metaplasia, epithelial dysplasia, and neovascularization were evaluated.
  Immunohistochemical staining was used to assess accumulation of p53 protein.
  Control individuals had no respiratory symptoms and their biopsies were
  unremarkable. Mexico City residents complained of epistaxis, rhinorrea, nasal
  crusting, dryness, and nasal obstruction. Their biopsies showed patchy
  shortening of cilia, deciliated areas, basal cell hyperplasia, and squamous
  metaplasia. Dysplastic lesions were predominantly located on antral squamous
  epithelium and in squamous metaplastic epithelium of the posterior inferior
  turbinates and they exhibited p53 nuclear accumulation. Individuals with > 10 h
  of daily outdoor exposure for 5 years or more had the highest rate of
  dysplasia. Subjects with epistaxis were more likely to have dysplasias and
  neovascularization. Results of this study suggest: (a) Nasal lesions in Mexico
  City residents are likely the results of many potentially toxic and/or
  carcinogenic pollutants, including ozone, aldehydes, particulate matter, and
  unmeasured pollutants; (b) the alteration of the nasal mucociliary defense
  mechanisms and the effects of reactive and/or water-soluble materials and
  particulates could be playing a major role in the nasal pathology; (c) the
  accumulation of p53 protein in dysplastic nasal lesions in the context of
  prolonged exposure to air pollutants raises the possibility that p53 mutations
  are already present and are providing the squamous cells with a selective
  advantage for clonal expansion; and (d) the nasal passages provide a valuable
  sentinel tissue for the detection of toxic air pollutants.

  represents a growing environmental problem involving an impact on water ecology
  and potential effect on human health. Most municipal wastewaters are complex
  mixtures; their complexity led as to carry out a hazard assessment using
  chemical analyses and biological tests. This study investigates biochemical
  alterations in two sentinel organisms, the Anodonta cygnea mussel and the
  Xenopus laevis frog exposed for different lengths of time to various
  concentration of wastewater of the S. Antonino Ticino treatment plant. The
  results point out the long-life of toxic compounds.

AB: The Total Oxyradical Scavenging Capacity (TOSC) has been characterized in
  various subcellular fractions from digestive gland of the mussel Mytilus sp.. A
  simple and sensitive gas-chromatographic assay is used for quantitating this
  new biochemical parameter. The method is based on the reaction between peroxyl
  radicals and alpha -keto- gamma -methiolbutyric acid (KMBA) which is oxidized
  to ethylene: in the presence of cellular antioxidant competing with KMBA for
  peroxyl radicals, ethylene formation is quantitatively reduced. Whole cytosol
  from M. edulis exhibited slightly higher TOSC values than the Mediterranean
  species. Soluble antioxidants provided greater protection than proteins
  accounting for 70% of oxyradical scavenging capacity of whole cytosols. TOSC
  assay was suitable also for lipid-soluble antioxidants, and the analysis of the
  microsomal fraction confirmed the importance of membrane-associated
  antioxidants in protection against toxicity of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
  The analysis of TOSC in sentinel organisms is proposed as a new index of
  contaminant exposure, one which permits quantifiable assessment of the
  biological resistance to oxidative stress.

AB: Sediments and marine organisms such as mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis),
  fish (Mullus barbatus, Serranus scriba), crabs (Polybius henslowi) and shrimp
  -like crustaceans (mysids, euphausiids) were sampled on European coasts,
  France, Spain) and analysed for their PAH content by gas chromatography/mass
  spectrometry (GC-MS). The PAH concentrations determined in the organisms were
  significantly negatively correlated with log K sub(ow) values, but to different
  extents according to the species. This was explained by the greater exposure of
  the organisms to the lower molecular weight compounds with differences
  resulting from different feeding habits, habitat, and biotransformation
  capacities of the organisms in relation to trophic levels. The influence of
  these observations on the use of different sentinel species in biomonitoring
  programmes is discussed.

AB: In a rural area of southeastern Tanzania, studies were undertaken on the
  dispersal and survival of Anopheles funestus Giles and A. gambiae Giles s.l.
  during the rainy season. Blood fed, resting mosquitoes were collected indoors,
  marked with fluorescent powder and released on the same day from two different
  sites in the study area. For two weeks indoor resting mosquitoes were collected
  from 11 houses in the release area. Additional collections were made with a
  light trap from a sentinel house in the centre of the study area. Anopheles
  funestus was more abundant than A. gambiae s.l. Of 4262 A. funestus and 645 A.
  gambiae s.l. released, 4.3% and 7.4%, respectively, were recaptured. Dispersal
  of mosquitoes was not random: one of three areas was favoured significantly
  more than the other areas, as shown by the recapture and movement rates of
  marked mosquitoes. Based on the regression of the recapture rate, estimated
  daily survival rates of A. funestus and A. gambiae s.l. were 0.63 and 0.78,
  respectively. These were significantly different. The differences in dispersal
  and survival rates between the two species are discussed in view of local
  topography and species-specific characteristics.

AB: Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) as a sentinel event implies a remediable
  exposure and an exposed cohort that require evaluation. A patient with HP
  convincingly related to her building led to a questionnaire survey in follow
  -up. Building coworkers demonstrated substantially higher symptom rates than
  did controls in five other buildings, although no further cases of disease were
  identified. It is likely that moisture sources in the building included an
  oversized cooling system and below-grade moisture, but the building met all
  applicable regulations and standards. Screening investigations for disease are
  not mandated by law and are often not conducted, in part because cost coverage
  is unclear. The absence of regulatory or professional standards that adequately
  address moisture in the built environment forces occupational health
  professionals to rely on disease documentation strategies to justify
  intervention.

AB: Background: The Sentinel Event Notification System for Occupational Risks
  (SENSOR) is a state/federal system for the surveillance and intervention of
  occupational conditions. The Ohio SENSOR program identifies silicosis cases
  from a number of data sources, although hospital discharge records have largely
  been considered the most successful means of carrying out SENSOR objectives.
  However, the cost-effectiveness of hospital discharge records has not been
  evaluated. Thus, a cost analysis was conducted to compare the effectiveness of
  hospital discharge records with other data sources for achieving prevention
  -related endpoints of silicosis surveillance. Methods: Total costs of reaching
  three endpoints (obtaining case names, identifying work sites, and identifying
  silica problems in work sites) were estimated retrospectively and measured in
  1996 dollars for four data sources: hospital discharge records, physician
  reports, workers' compensation claims, and death certificates. Total costs were
  then divided by output for each source/endpoint combination to produce
  estimates of average costs. Results: The average cost per case was $30 for
  hospital records, $212 for physician reports, $19 for workers' compensation
  claims, and $7 for death certificates. However, for identifying problem work
  sites, hospital records were most expensive at $2,883 per work site, compared
  with $2,558 for physician reports, $1,318 for workers' compensation claims, and
  $1,310 for death certificates. Conclusions: Hospital discharge records were
  least cost-effective for accomplishing prevention-related goals of
  surveillance. A change in the mix of resources applied to silicosis
  surveillance and intervention under SENSOR, i.e., a shift away from follow-up
  of hospital records toward more cost-effective methods for identifying work
  sites with silica problems may result in more efficient use of public health
  resources devoted to the prevention of silicosis.

AB: The Brown Pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis) has endured a tremendous decline
  and recovery over the past fifty years. The precipitous decline, primarily
  affecting populations inhabiting the U.S. Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts,
  coincided with the heavy use of organochlorine pesticides (e.g. DDT, Endrin,
  Dieldrin). The decline has implicated reproductive failure associated with DDT
  dispersal and accumulation (i.e. eggshell thinning), acute mortality,
  ecological disruption (i.e. prey base decline), and natural causes (i.e.
  meteorological, climatic, disease). Listed as an endangered species in 1970,
  the Brown Pelican has since made a remarkable recovery and demonstrated the
  goal of the Endangered Species Act of 1973. However, the sensitivity exhibited
  by this species to organochlorine compounds and ecological disruption clearly
  defines its role as a past, present, and future sentinel of environmental
  degradation.

AB: Many populations of waders breeding on open shores and shores with short
  vegetation especially on the Baltic coasts have recently become endangered. The
  declines have taken place simultaneously with human-induced loss and
  deterioration of habitats due to eutrophication and overgrowth. To investigate
  mechanisms by which habitat changes could affect breeding success and
  ultimately population dynamics, we studied an endangered coastal population of
  Temminck's stint. We hypothesized that the rate of nest predation has become
  higher because the nest defence strategy (early detection of predator and early
  departure from the nest), which originally evolved in open habitats, is less
  effective on shores with reduced visibility. As predicted, nests survived
  better on wide than on narrow shores. Predation made a major contribution to
  this trend, although successful and predated nests did not differ in
  concealment at a microhabitat scale. The better the visibility from the nest,
  the longer was the flushing distance, but only in response to alarm calls or
  behaviour of other species, not when they were absent. Temminck's stints seem
  to obtain information about an approaching predator visually from sentinels.
  Therefore, it is essential that there is at least moderate visibility around
  the nest. We conclude that habitat characteristics - visibility from the nest
  and sentinel birds - affect the effectiveness of the nest defence strategy of
  Temminck's stint. These should be taken into account when seeking causes and
  mechanisms for declines of Temminck's stint and other waders of open and
  shortly vegetated shores.

AB: In previous laboratory experiments, slugs were shown to be sensitive to
  metal pollution. Therefore, they might be invaluable instruments for biological
  assessment of soil pollution. The present investigation was carried out to
  validate previous laboratory results in a field study. Slugs were collected
  from an abandoned copper mine (Parys mountain top, PMT), from a site 7 km away
  from the mine (Parys mountain bottom, PMB), and from a clean site (Snowdonia
  Cwm Idwal, SCI) in Wales in early July 1994. Whole soft body and digestive
  gland Cd, Cu, and Zn concentrations were measured by means of atomic absorption
  spectrophotometry (AAS). The digestive gland was the main tissue for metal
  accumulation, with significant differences in tissue metal levels between
  samples from different sites. PMB presented the highest Cd and Zn levels and
  the highest Cu levels were found at PMT. In addition, metals were demonstrated
  in situ by autometallography as black silver deposits (BSD) on histological
  sections of digestive gland tissue. The extent of BSD within lysosomes of
  digestive cells was closely related to metal levels determined by AAS.
  Histochemistry revealed that Ca metabolism and structural and reserve
  connective tissues might be altered in slugs living in metal-polluted soils.
  Finally, tissue-level biomarkers of biological effect [mean epithelial
  thickness (MET), mean diverticular radius (MDR), mean luminal radius (MLR),
  MET/MDR and MLR/MET] were quantified by image analysis of digestive gland
  histological sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin. MET and MDR values of
  slugs collected from SCI were high, while slugs from PMB presented low MLR/MET
  associated with environmental stress induced by metal exposure. We conclude
  that exposure and effect biomarkers recorded in sentinel slugs could be
  sensitive, quick, and cheap indices of metal pollution in soils. A Slug Watch
  monitoring program could be developed similar to the Mussel Watch program,
  which is currently applied to assess environmental quality in coastal and
  estuarine areas.

AB: Bivalves are extensively used in monitoring programmes in the marine
  environment due to their ability to concentrate pollutants to several orders of
  magnitude above ambient levels in sea water. Commonly, the levels of
  contaminants accumulated in the tissues has been used to indicate the degree of
  chemical contamination in the environment. Trace metals are the main sources of
  metals toxicity in the marine environment by entering the food chain and thus
  affecting the ecosystem. The marine ecosystem off Qatar has been recently
  subjected to the direct release of urban and industrial runoff from major
  centres. Such inputs are known to contain trace metals which lead to increased
  metals concentrations in the coastal zone, some of which are toxic and can
  endanger human health. A wealth of knowledge exists for heavy metals in
  bivalves in many areas of the world while little appears for the Arabian Gulf
  species. In the present study an attempt has been made to analyse the metal
  accumulation in the abundant bivalve P. radiata in order to test its
  potentiality as sentinel accumulator of heavy metals from the marine
  environment around Qatar. It could be considered as a first step in developing
  a regional programme for monitoring metals in the Gulf environment.

AB: A Canadian moratorium on directed fishing has been in effect for the 2J+3KL
  northern cod (Gadus morhua) stock since July 1992. Catches in 1993-1997 came
  from various combinations of by-catch, food fisheries, and sentinel surveys.
  The catch in 1997 was reported as 505 tons, consisting of 159 tons from by
  -catch and 346 t from sentinel surveys. The quantity of cod in offshore waters,
  as determined from bottom-trawl surveys, continued to be only 1-2% of values in
  the period 1983-1989. The total mortality rate estimated from the autumn
  surveys in 1995-1997 was very high (Z=0.77). The quantity of cod in the inshore
  remains uncertain. Catch rates in the inshore sentinel surveys were poor in
  Division 2J and in Division 3K north of White Bay, but were considered by
  sentinel fishers to be good at many sites from White Bay south. Nevertheless,
  an acoustic survey in inshore waters from White Bay to St. Mary's Bay in
  southern Division 3L provided a biomass estimate of only 18,000 t. A
  biologically justifiable analytical assessment was not achieved, as catches
  could not be reconciled with the autumn research vessel index. An exploration
  of current stock productivity indicated that the spawner biomass may decline in
  the absence of a fishery if the Z of 0.77 is appropriate for all components of
  the stock. Recruitment to the offshore continues to be extremely low.

AB: On 17-18 February 1997 approximately 30 participants from Canada and USA
  gathered in Dartmouth, NS (Canada) to discuss alternatives to the Adult Fish
  Survey (AFS) component of Canada's Environmental Effects Monitoring (EEM)
  program for liquid effluents from pulp asnd paper mills. During the first cycle
  (1993-1996) of the pulp mill EEM, the AFS performed reasonably well in the
  freshwater environment for which it was designed, but poorly in the marine and
  estuarine environments. The objective of the workshop was to assist the AFS
  Expert Working Group in making recommendations for the second cycle by: 1)
  reviewing difficulties with Adult Fish Surveys in Cycle One; 2) exploring
  alternative approaches; 3) identifying alternatives that are not ready for
  Cycle Two; and 4) identifying alternatives that are not ready for Cycle Two but
  that merit further research and development in order that they be available for
  Cycle Three and beyond. Presentations were given on experiences and
  difficulties with the AFS in Cycle One across the country and of potential
  alternatives to be considered for Cycle Two including: use of alternate
  sentinel species including macroinvertebrates and forage fish; use of alternate
  endpoints including health indices, scope-for-growth, behavioural and life
  history indices; cageing of bivalves and finfish; and mesocosms. In light of
  the principle for conducting EEM studies and the comments made by workshop
  participants, alternative methods identified as being acceptable for Cycle Two
  are, in order of preference, surveys of wild forage fish (i.e, small-bodied,
  sedentary fish), wild bivalves, juvenile fish, caged bivalves. and mesocosm
  studies with fish.

AB: Species composition reflects a combination of environmental and historical
  events at a site; hence, changes in species composition can provide a sensitive
  measure of ecologically relevant changes in the environment. Here, we consider
  the analysis of species composition when multiple sites are followed through
  time. Analyses of temporal trends in species composition either summarize
  species composition into a few metrics (indices or axis scores) or analyze the
  similarity among sites. We develop and illustrate the similarity approach. Each
  pair of samples represents a pair of replicates, a pair from the same site at
  different times, a pair from different sites at the same time, or an unrelated
  pair. Differences among times can be estimated by comparing average temporal
  dissimilarity to average replicate dissimilarity. Temporal trends can be
  described by one of three statistics that measure progressive change, the
  correlation of temporal dissimilarity with the length of time between samples.
  These methods are illustrated using data on changes in a South Carolina
  zooplankton assemblage following disturbance, and changes in bird species
  composition on Skokholm Island, Wales. It is difficult to define and interpret
  temporal trends. Some definitions of interesting trends, like increasing
  divergence from another set of sample plots, place additional requirements on
  the sampling design. Including replicate samples or clustering sample plots and
  including "control" plots for comparison with sentinel sites would contribute
  to an understanding of changes in species composition.

AB: In the sentinel-site approach to monitoring ecological resources, relatively
  small numbers of locations are chosen for intensive study, each location being
  selected to represent a certain, preferably large, class of ecosystems. This
  paper examines long-term studies at three inland aquatic ecosystems in
  California that, although never intended as sentinel sites, nevertheless
  illustrate the challenges posed by sentinel-site networks. The main mechanisms
  of interannual variability in primary productivity or producers are described
  for Castle Lake, Lake Tahoe, and northern San Francisco Bay. The external
  forces behind the variability include climate (in the form of both snowfall and
  total precipitation), fishing intensity, anthropogenic nitrogen emissions,
  spring weather systems, intrinsic population cycles, forest fires, water
  diversions, and invasions of exotics. Each mechanism is associated with certain
  critical ecosystem features (such as hydraulic residence time) that condition a
  responsiveness to one or a combination of these external forces (such as
  precipitation); these critical features are identified for each mechanism.
  Three demanding conditions must be fulfilled in order for a sentinel site to
  function with regard to a given stressor: (1) some subset of the network must
  encounter the stressor; (2) at least some sites in the subset must have the
  critical features that cause responsiveness to that stressor; and (3) the
  background variability at those sites must not disguise the response to the
  stressor of interest. In practice, reliable extrapolation from sentinel-site
  networks to regional trends appears to be beyond our ecological understanding
  at the present time.

AB: Changes in forest resources have been estimated in a variety of ways. This
  paper focuses on extensive forest surveys rather than on sentinel-site
  investigations. The sampling design and plot design used are key to precise
  estimates of change. Alternative sampling designs include temporary surveys,
  Continuous Forest Inventory, and Sampling with Partial Replacement. Each can be
  used in conjunction with stratified sampling or double sampling for
  stratification. Plot designs can involve variable-radius or Bitterlich sampling
  for trees, and fixed-area plots for most attributes. In extensive surveys, it
  is efficient to group plots into clusters. Plots must be sampled at a frequency
  that is commensurate with the rate of change, degree of interest, and funding
  available. Often, plots are less than a hectare in size and spaced widely
  across the population. Continuous Forest Inventory, with or without
  stratification, is efficient for estimating current values, net change, and
  components of change. Much work remains in scaling to understand landscape
  -level interactions and to identify stressors and indicators of forest health
  and sustainability.

AB: Research was conducted to assess the suitability of small fish species as
  sentinel species for monitoring the effects of pulp mill effluent on fish
  populations. Evaluation of small species was based on their response to mill
  effluent, as well as the abundance and capture efficiency of each species.
  Responses were described by comparing whole organism (growth, reproduction,
  energy storage, age) and physiological (MFO induction, sex steroid levels)
  measurements in fish exposed to pulp mill effluent with comparable reference
  fish populations not exposed to effluent. Research focused on spoonhead sculpin
  (Conus ricei) and lake chub (Couesius plumbeus) of the Athabasca River,
  Alberta, to determine whether changes in whole-organism and physiological
  measurements could be detected in small fish species exposed to pulp mill
  effluent.

AB: One of the national health objectives for 2000 (HP2000) is to establishe and
  monitor nonoccupational "sentinel" environmental diseases, including asthma,
  heatstroke, hypothermia, heavy metal poisoning, pesticide poisoning, carbon
  monoxide poisoning, acute chemical poisoning, and methemoglobinemia, in at
  least 35 states (baseline: 0 stats in 1990) (objective 11.16). To assess
  progress toward this objective, the Council of State and Territorial
  Epidemiologists (CSTE), the Association of Schools of Public Health, and CDC
  conducted a telephone survey of environmental epidemiologists in each of the 50
  states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico during June-August 1997. This
  report summarizes the results of that survey, which indicate that progress is
  being made toward the HP2000 objective.

AB: The development of Aprostocetus hagenowii (Ratzeburg) in irradiated 2-wk-old
  Periplaneta americana (L.) oothecae yielded a significantly higher percentage
  of female-biased clutches than freeze-killed oothecae, but per clutch the
  number of females and males, sex ratio, and developmental time were not
  significantly different. In parasitoid development studies, ootheca age and the
  factor clutch significantly affected the number of female and male parasitoids
  per clutch; younger oothecae yielded more parasitoids than older oothecae.
  Weekly for 30 wk, parasitoids were released in blattid-infested treeholes.
  Parasitism of sentinel oothecae at release sites was higher than at control
  sites each week after the release program was initiated. From April to
  November, parasitism of sentinel oothecae in control treeholes was 10-40% but
  peaked at 46% the week of 7 July. Weekly winter (December through March)
  sentinel ootheca parasitism was <10%. Parasitism of sentinel oothecae in
  release treeholes remained higher for 10 of the 11 wk after parasitoid releases
  were terminated, indicating that naturally occurring oothecae, parasitized
  during the release program, served as inoculum for subsequent generations of
  parasitoids.

  sentinel species for monitoring of heavy metals. A comparison of their levels
  in the animals inhabiting the Salton Sea with those from coastal waters of the
  Pacific Ocean showed that the sea, contrary to expectations, has not been
  severely contaminated by heavy metals. The accumulations of the metals in
  barnacle bodies and eggs varied markedly between the stations but appeared
  least where organic pollution was highest.

  provide a more effective role in decision making for those with practical
  experience and knowledge of the fishery. It was established to be a partnership
  between governments, the scientific community and the direct stakeholders in
  the fishery. Its mandate is to contribute to the management of the Atlantic
  fishery on a sustainable basis, with a goal to address the failures and abuses
  which led to the past crisis. This is the first time the Council has issued an
  anual report. This past year the Council produced a series of reports on
  groundfish conservation advice which were released in 1997 and 1998, allowing
  the Council to better match the latest advice from DFO Science and the results
  of the sentinel fisheries with the timing of the Council's advice. The title of
  the annual report, Conservation must be compulsory, not optional, speaks to the
  collective tendency over time to ignore conservation when things are good or
  prices high and focus on conservation only when the stocks plummet and
  collapse. A conservation minded attitude is a prerequisite to the building of a
  conservation capacity..

  (Comet) assay to evaluate the in vivo genotoxicity of two potent rodent bladder
  carcinogens, o-anisidine and p-cresidine, in mouse liver, lung, kidney, brain,
  and bone marrow, and in the mucosa of stomach, colon, and bladder. Male CD-1
  mice (8 weeks old) were sacrificed 3 and 24 h after oral administration of o
  -anisidine at 690 mg/kg or p-cresidine at 595 mg/kg. Both chemicals were
  dissolved in olive oil. Both chemicals yielded statistically significant DNA
  damage in bladder mucosa 3 and 24 h after treatment. o -Anisidine yielded DNA
  damage in the colon at 3 h, but not at 24 h. No significant effects were
  observed in any other organs. Our results suggest the importance of the urinary
  bladder as a sentinel organ for evaluating chemical genotoxicity in rodents.

AB: Unintentional carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is a substantial health
  problem. While numbers of poisonings have been decreasing, in the United States
  it is a common cause of fatal injury with 800 to 1,000 cases annually. CO is a
  colourless, odourless, toxic gas that is produced when fuel burns without
  sufficient oxygen. Its main sources are motors, heaters and appliances that use
  carbon-based fuels. Low CO levels result in non-specific symptoms including
  nausea, dizziness, fatigue and headache, while higher levels lead to
  unconsciousness, heart failure and death. Many cases of CO poisoning occur when
  individuals are not aware of specific hazards. These poisonings occur
  frequently during power outages, due to the use of alternative methods of
  heating and cooking. The purpose of this report is to describe a cluster of
  unintentional CO poisonings that presented to the two emergency departments
  (EDs) in Kingston, Ontario. These poisonings occurred following the severe ice
  storm that swept through western Quebec and eastern Ontario in January 1998.
  This analysis demonstrates: the importance of CO poisoning as a public health
  issue during power outages; and, how an injury surveillance program can be used
  to monitor sentinel patterns of injury at a community level.

AB: U.S. military personnel may be exposed to a wide variety of potentially
  toxic chemicals, Examples include deployments in developing countries, and
  combat conditions in a variety of circumstances. The chemicals personnel may
  encounter, particularly in combat situations, often are neurotoxicants.
  Predeployment screening methods such as behavioral and physiological
  measurements can be used to rapidly assess these potential health hazards. The
  objectives of this research were to evaluate physiological and behavioral
  endpoints of neurotoxicity in fish following exposure to selected chemicals
  (the organophosphates malathion and diazinon), and to assess the correlation
  between physiology and behavior, Results indicated consistent trends between
  swimming behaviors (distance and speed swam, rate of turning, and tortuosity of
  path) and concentrations within and across exposure times. Similar results
  occurred with measurement of cholinesterase activity. A trend was observed with
  muscarinic cholinergic receptor number consistent with changes in
  cholinesterase activity. More importantly, there was a significant correlation
  between behavioral and physiological endpoints for malathion, but not diazinon.
  These results support sentinel monitoring as a screening method for
  neurotoxicity prior to troop deployment. This report summarizes research
  completed in year one. In the second year, we will assess effects of other
  chemical classes and mixtures of chemicals.

AB: PURPOSE: Recent techniques in nuclear medicine have permitted to implement
  new procedures useful in surgery. Among these, the procedures for locating
  sentinel lymph nodes and nonpalpable breast lesions are of great interest. The
  protocols for the location of the sentinel lymph node and for the radioguided
  location of occult lesions developed at the European Institute of Oncology
  (IEO, Milan) are based on the administration of radiopharmaceuticals labelled
  with Technetium-99m (99mTc). We evaluated the dosimetric data relative to
  patients and hospital personnel to assess whether specific radiation protection
  procedures are needed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty patients with nonpalpable
  breast lesions and 50 patients with suspected lymph node involvement were
  enrolled in this study. All the patients underwent surgery the day after in
  -loco administration of the radiopharmaceutical (11 MBq of 99mTc). The absorbed
  dose to the hospital personnel was estimated from the air kerma rate measured
  by ionization chamber at different distances from the patients at 0 and 16
  hours after the radiopharmaceutical administration. In order to evaluate
  radiation protection for patients, absorbed doses were measured positioning
  thermoluminescent dosimeters on the patient's skin for about 16 hours. In the
  operating room, activity was measured on some excised tissues (lymph nodes and
  tumors) and on surgical instruments. RESULTS: Absorbed doses were very low for
  the clinical staff also in case of prolonged patient assistance. After 100
  cases, the surgeon mean absorbed dose to the hands and mean effective dose were
  .45 mGy and .09 mGy, respectively. These values correspond to 1% of the annual
  dose limit to the hands and to 10% of the annual equivalent effective dose
  recommended for the population (ICRP 60 and law by decree 230/95). The absorbed
  dose to healthy tissues of the patients were lower than 1 mGy (mean values:
  contralateral breast: .9 mGy; abdomen .45 mGy). The mean activity detected in
  the excised tissues was 9 kBq and 900 kBq in the sentinel lymph nodes and in
  the tumor lesions (injection site), respectively. The activity detected on the
  surgical instruments, higher on gauzes (

AB: OBJECTIVE: The pilot study was undertaken to investigate whether doctors and
  pharmacists in the private sector are willing to undertake Adverse Drug
  Reaction (ADR) reporting, to analyse their perceptions with regard to ADR
  reporting and to determine whether the concept of sentinel reporters could be
  of value in Zimbabwe. DESIGN: An open, prospective study where a selected group
  of private general medical practitioners and community pharmacists were asked
  to report any suspected ADRs over a six month period and to complete a
  structured self administered questionnaire. SETTING: Private medical and
  pharmacy practices in Harare. SUBJECTS: General medical practitioners and
  community pharmacists. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of ADR reports received at
  Medicines Control Authority (MCA) and questionnaire responses. RESULTS: 19
  reports were received from participants (eight pharmacists and five doctors)
  accounting for 79.2% of ADR reports to the MCA, during the study period.
  Seventeen (89.5%) of the reports generated from the study came from doctors.
  The 19 reports involved 15 different drugs, three (20%) of which had been
  registered in the last three years. Twelve questionnaires were completed.
  Serious and unexpected reactions were more likely to be reported. Most
  respondents knew what was expected and were willing to report, although five
  (41.7%) felt they were too busy. Seventy five percent of the doctors had not
  known that a reporting scheme existed in Zimbabwe and none of the participants
  had ever sent in a report prior to the study. Medical journals and the drug
  manufacturers were the most important sources of information about ADRs.
  CONCLUSION: Simply having interested pharmacists and doctors on the look out
  for ADRs and increased reporting of ADRs to the MCA. There are willing health
  care personnel but there is a need for larger studies to see if sentinel
  reporting of ADRs is applicable on a country wide basis.

AB: A wide range of chemicals, particulate matter, and gaseous air pollutants
  are present in urban atmospheres and may pose a significant health risk for
  human populations. Nasal passages are the first site of contact of the
  respiratory tract with the environment and offer significant protection to the
  lower respiratory tract by conditioning the inspired air. This activity, which
  includes removal of certain pollutants, places the nose at risk of pathological
  changes, including cancer. Mexico City residents are exposed to a complex
  mixture of air pollutants. Based on predicted nasal air flow characteristics,
  four nasal biopsy sites were selected for study in adult male volunteers from a
  control low polluted town (n = 12) and southwest metropolitan Mexico City
  permanent residents (n = 54). Clinical data with emphasis on nasal symptoms and
  histopathological changes including basal and goblet cell hyperplasia, squamous
  metaplasia, epithelial dysplasia, and neovascularization were evaluated.
  Immunohistochemical staining was used to assess accumulation of p53 protein.
  Control individuals had no respiratory symptoms and their biopsies were
  unremarkable. Mexico City residents complained of epistaxis, rhinorrea, nasal
  crusting, dryness, and nasal obstruction. Their biopsies showed patchy
  shortening of cilia, deciliated areas, basal cell hyperplasia, and squamous
  metaplasia. Dysplastic lesions were predominantly located on antral squamous
  epithelium and in squamous metaplastic epithelium of the posterior inferior
  turbinates and they exhibited p53 nuclear accumulation. Individuals with > 10 h
  of daily outdoor exposure for 5 years or more had the highest rate of
  dysplasia. Subjects with epistaxis were more likely to have dysplasias and
  neovascularization. Results of this study suggest: (a) Nasal lesions in Mexico
  City residents are likely the result of many potentially toxic and/or
  carcinogenic pollutants, including ozone, aldehydes, particulate matter, and
  unmeasured pollutants; (b) the alteration of the nasal mucociliary defense
  mechanisms and the effects of reactive and/or water-soluble materials and
  particulates could be playing a major role in the nasal pathology; (c) the
  accumulation of p53 protein in dysplastic nasal lesions in the context of
  prolonged exposure to air pollutants raises the possibility that p53 mutations
  are already present and are providing the squamous cells with a selective
  advantage for clonal expansion; and (d) the nasal passages provide a valuable
  sentinel tissue for the detection of toxic air pollutants.

AB: How often do general practitioners have to deal with environmental problems?
  To answer this question 23 GPs recorded all relevant consultations during one
  year in Hamburg. On an average, each of these GPs reported one contact once a
  month. The spectrum of both patient complaints and environmental sources was
  broad. The GP is less often convinced of a causal connection between both than
  the patient. In most cases a referral was not necessary. This study supports
  the assumption that the frequency of environmental problems in General Practice
  is--at least in the larger cities--lower than estimated from former studies and
  the self-image of general practice in Germany.

AB: SWORD is one of seven clinically based reporting schemes which together now
  provide almost comprehensive coverage of occupational diseases across the UK.
  Although SWORD is now in its tenth year, participation rates remain high. Of an
  estimated 3,903 new cases seen this year, 1,031 (26%) were of occupational
  asthma, 978 (25%) of mesothelioma, 794 (20%) of non-malignant pleural disease,
  336 (9%) of pneumoconiosis and 233 (6%) of inhalation accidents. Incidence
  rates of occupational asthma were generally highest among workers in the
  manufacture of wood products, textiles and food (particularly grain products
  and crustaceans) and additionally, in the production of precious and non
  -ferrous metals, rubber goods, detergents and perfumes, and in mining. Health
  care workers were noted to have a surprisingly high incidence of inhalation
  accidents. Occupational asthma attributed to latex has increased dramatically;
  the highest rates are among laboratory technicians, shoe workers and health
  care workers.

AB: Critical Incident Monitoring (CIM) as an instrument of quality assurance
  (QA) has received increasing attention in recent years. The present study was
  developed to explore a potential role for CIM in QA for clinical psychiatry. A
  questionnaire was sent to psychiatrists and requested retrospective reporting
  of clinical incidents, and a pilot study of an inpatient-based incident
  reporting system was performed. All Fellows of the Royal Australian and New
  Zealand College of Psychiatry (RANZCP) were sent a questionnaire. Eight
  psychiatric inpatient services were invited to participate in the pilot study.
  The returns of the questionnaires were aggregated and analysed to reveal a
  relatively small number of separate incident types, with little difference
  between the 'adverse outcome' and 'near-miss' categories. Similar results were
  found with the pilot study. It was concluded that the development of a unified
  incident reporting system for use by psychiatric clinicians and psychiatric
  services may add usefully to existing quality improvement processes.

AB: BACKGROUND: In the treatment of breast cancer, the indication for adjuvant
  systemic treatment was extended also to nodal negative tumor stages in the last
  years. For that reason, the indicator status of axillary dissection lost some
  of its importance. Therefore, in node negative patients, the necessity of
  axillary dissection and the use of definitive axillary radiotherapy, which
  causes less morbidity, may be reconsidered. METHODS: In a review of the related
  literature, we present international treatment experiences related to axillary
  dissection, axillary radiotherapy and "sentinel node dissection" (SLND). In
  addition, our long-term experiences in 19 patients with clinically negative
  axillary nodes treated by conservative surgery without axillary dissection but
  axillary radiotherapy, are reported. RESULTS: The median rate of axillary
  recurrences with axillary radiotherapy is 2.0%, the regional (supraclavicular
  and retrosternal) recurrence rate 2.7%. With axillary dissection, axillary
  recurrences occur in 1 to 2%, in nodal negative stages in 0 to 1%, the median
  regional recurrence rate is 2.2%. A meta-analysis presented in 1995 by the
  Early Breast Cancer Study Group showed no significant difference in the
  regional recurrence rate or the overall survival between axillary dissection
  and axillary radiotherapy. With SLND, usually only one axillary node is
  excised. With the help of molecular and immunohistochemical methods, SLND may
  predict axillary involvement with high precision. CONCLUSIONS: Definitive
  radiotherapy of the axilla is a valid treatment option for patients without
  palpable axillary nodes with the potential advantage of being less cost
  intensive and better tolerated. If the indication for systemic therapy is no
  more dependent on the axillary status, axillary dissection may be replaced by
  axillary radiotherapy. In small tumors without risk factors and without
  indication for systemic therapy, SLND seems to be the best treatment option.

AB: Asthma is a common chronic illness characterized by episodes of reversible
  airflow obstruction. A cornerstone of asthma management is identifying and
  avoiding agents that cause bronchospasm. The workplace is an important
  potential source of respirable exposures that can cause or trigger asthma.
  Identification of an occupational factor in asthma is important: early
  diagnosis and removal of the worker from the exposure is associated with
  improved prognosis; the diagnosis of occupational asthma may lead to
  compensation for work-related impairment and disability; and the diagnosis of
  occupational asthma is a Sentinel Health Event with implications for public
  health and prevention. In this article, we review specific causes of
  occupational asthma and general settings in which an occupational factor should
  be suspected and explored as part of the management of the worker with asthma.
  We also review specific and simple elements of history and pulmonary function
  testing that can be easily assessed by most health care practitioners and may
  be sufficient to establish a diagnosis of occupational asthma. Finally, we
  review the medical-legal implications of occupational asthma.

AB: The objectives of post-licensure surveillance are to identify rare or novel
  adverse events, estimate their rate of occurrence and distinguish those that
  are causally related to vaccination. Evidence of causality is based on
  biological plausibility supported by laboratory evidence of vaccine involvement
  and/or a statistically significant excess of events in the post-vaccination
  period. Passive reporting systems have methodological limitations, particularly
  for ascertaining reliable adverse event rates and investigating causal
  relationships. In Canada, an active surveillance system (IMPACT) has been
  established in sentinel paediatric hospitals where nurses scrutinise all
  admissions for conditions conforming to a defined set of adverse events. While
  ascertainment of events resulting in hospital admission should be complete,
  causality is difficult to assess without information on the incidence of such
  events outside the post-vaccination risk period. The use of computerised data
  bases which link clinical events with immunisation records have allowed the
  risk of events such as convulsions attributable to DTP, MMR and Hib vaccines to
  be defined. The record linkage method promises to be a useful method for
  routine surveillance of vaccine safety.

AB: A 5-year sentinel surveillance of diphtheria from 1989 to 1993 was
  undertaken at a rural medical college hospital. No significant change in the
  number of diphtheria cases was observed in spite of sustained high level of
  diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus vaccine-3 doses (DPT3) coverage. Most of the
  diphtheria cases occurred during July to November. Age distribution of
  diphtheria cases showed that more than 75% occurred above 2 years age (except
  in 1989) and around 65% cases above 3 years age. The age shift in diphtheria
  signified success of primary diphtheria immunisation, as well as indicated the
  lack of coverage with booster doses at appropriate ages. Because of high
  coverage with primary diphtheria immunisation there was decrease in circulating
  toxigenic C diphtheriae resulting in less natural boosting of antibody titre.
  Thus, in absence of booster immunisation, the older children and adults were
  more vulnerable to diphtheria. The findings of the study justified the need of
  emphasising importance of booster diphtheria immunisation at appropriate ages
  for effective control of diphtheria.

AB: A combined enhanced inactivated polio vaccine (EIPV) and oral polio vaccine
  (OPV) programme was introduced in Israel in 1990, with the purpose of providing
  a solution to the persistent polio morbidity in spite of a 30 year long OPV
  programme. The schedule comprised two doses of EIPV administered at the age of
  2 and 4 months, intercalated with two doses of OPV at 4 and 6 months, followed
  by a reinforcing dose with the two vaccines simultaneously administered at 12
  months. The 5-year evaluation of the programme included: the assessment of
  clinical suspicions of polio, early immune response in successive cohorts
  administered the new schedule, dynamics of the immune profile in a cohort
  followed up to the age of 5, and monitoring of wild poliovirus excretion in
  sewage specimens collected in 25 permanent sites throughout Israel as well as
  from the Palestinian Authority. No paralytic polio cases associated with a wild
  or vaccinal poliovirus strain were detected since the introduction of the
  programme. At the age of 4 months, one week after administration of the second
  EIPV and first OPV dose, 100% seropositivity and high geometric mean titres
  (GMTs) of neutralizing antibody (NA) to the three vaccinal and to the wild
  poliovirus type 1, responsible for the 1988 polio outbreak, were observed. No
  change in percent of seropositivity occurred between the age of 6 and 12
  months. Thirty days after the IPV and OPV reinforcing doses, GMTs to each of
  the four poliovirus strains were > or = 3037. Up to the age of 5, the
  seropositivity was unchanged. After a 2.5-10-fold decline in the first year
  following the completion of the programme, GMTs to the three vaccinal and the
  wild poliovirus strain levelled off at rather high values, considered
  protective. Between 1990 and 1995, 16 wild poliovirus type 1 strains were
  isolated in three separate episodes in Gaza Strip sewage and once only in one
  Israeli site very close to Gaza City. The rapidly established, high and
  persistent NA titre to the vaccinal and wild poliovirus strains and the
  presence of immunological memory are indicative of high individual protection
  throughout the first 5 years of life. The only one-time introduction, without
  circulation, of a wild poliovirus strain in a single Israeli settlement
  suggests community protection. The intercalated programme offers a contribution
  to polio eradication by providing a solution to the primary and secondary
  failure associated with OPV, as well as to the control of vaccine-associated
  paralytic poliomyelitis.

AB: Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) as a sentinel event implies a remediable
  exposure and an exposed cohort that require evaluation. A patient with HP
  convincingly related to her building led to a questionnaire survey in follow
  -up. Building coworkers demonstrated substantially higher symptom rates than
  did controls in five other buildings, although no further cases of disease were
  identified. It is likely that moisture sources in the building included an
  oversized cooling system and below-grade moisture, but the building met all
  applicable regulations and standards. Screening investigations for disease are
  not mandated by law and are often not conducted, in part because cost coverage
  is unclear. The absence of regulatory or professional standards that adequately
  address moisture in the built environment forces occupational health
  professionals to rely on disease documentation strategies to justify
  intervention.

AB: BACKGROUND: The Sentinel Event Notification System for Occupational Risks
  (SENSOR) is a state/federal system for the surveillance and intervention of
  occupational conditions. The Ohio SENSOR program identifies silicosis cases
  from a number of data sources, although hospital discharge records have largely
  been considered the most successful means of carrying out SENSOR objectives.
  However, the cost-effectiveness of hospital discharge records has not been
  evaluated. Thus, a cost analysis was conducted to compare the effectiveness of
  hospital discharge records with other data sources for achieving prevention
  -related endpoints of silicosis surveillance. METHODS: Total costs of reaching
  three endpoints (obtaining case names, identifying work sites, and identifying
  silica problems in work sites) were estimated retrospectively and measured in
  1996 dollars for four data sources: hospital discharge records, physician
  reports, workers' compensation claims, and death certificates. Total costs were
  then divided by output for each source/endpoint combination to produce
  estimates of average costs. RESULTS: The average cost per case was $30 for
  hospital records, $212 for physician reports, $19 for workers' compensation
  claims, and $7 for death certificates. However, for identifying problem work
  sites, hospital records were most expensive at $2,883 per work site, compared
  with $2,558 for physician reports, $1,318 for workers' compensation claims, and
  $1,310 for death certificates. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital discharge records were
  least cost-effective for accomplishing prevention-related goals of
  surveillance. A change in the mix of resources applied to silicosis
  surveillance and intervention under SENSOR, i.e., a shift away from follow-up
  of hospital records toward more cost-effective methods for identifying work
  sites with silica problems may result in more efficient use of public health
  resources devoted to the prevention of silicosis.

AB: OBJECTIVE: Spontaneous reporting is the most common method used in
  pharmacovigilance and the best one to generate signals on new or rare adverse
  drug reactions (ADRs). Under-reporting is a major drawback of this system. The
  objective of this study was to quantify the extent of under-reporting in
  general practice and to assess the factors which influence it. METHODS: Details
  of ADRs collected through a short intensive survey were compared with primary
  care spontaneous reports received by the Castilla y Leon Regional
  Pharmacovigilance Centre during a 12-month reference period. The survey was
  undertaken by a random sample of 146 general practitioners (GPs), providing
  care to 149,487 people. The pharmacovigilance centre received reports
  concerning the whole regional population (2.5 million) covered by primary
  health care. The under-reporting coefficient (U) was estimated as the ratio
  between the number of effects observed by physicians in the survey and those
  spontaneously reported to the pharmacovigilance centre. RESULTS: The overall
  under-reporting rate was 1144 [95% confidence interval (CI): 928-1409]. Under
  -reporting was greater for psychiatric (2119; 945-4752) and gastrointestinal
  (1946; 1424-2659) disorders. Severe effects were more reported (U = 605; 151
  -2431) than moderate (863; 473-1575) and mild (1209; 973-1503) ones. The under
  -reporting rate was lower for drugs recently marketed (706; 406-1230) and
  slightly lower for unlabelled effects (1031; 641-1657). CONCLUSION: The under
  -reporting rate of ADRs is considerable, though not homogeneous for the
  different cases. This should be taken into account when comparing adverse
  effects (AEs) for different drugs. Under-reporting seems to be positively
  selective, as it involves mainly the less severe and better-known effects,
  preserving the value of spontaneous reporting for signal detection.

AB: Sentinel (first tumor-draining) lymph node (SLN) biopsy directed by the blue
  dye technique may be as accurate as complete axillary lymph node dissection
  (ALND) in determining whether breast cancer has metastasized to the lymph nodes
  and may have fewer surgical complications because it is less invasive. Breast
  cancer patients scheduled for ALND between February and June 1997 who did not
  have prior axillary surgery, prior radiation therapy, or preoperative
  chemotherapy were included. Isosulfan blue dye was injected around the primary
  tumor or the biopsy cavity just before ALND. Operations were performed in a
  tertiary breast center by two breast surgeons who did not have experience with
  the technique before this study. The results of blue stained nodes were
  compared to those of the ALND. Blue-stained nodes were identified in 35 of 40
  patients (88%), and the results were concordant with ALND in 33 of 35 (94%), 7
  patients were concordant for positive results and 26 for negative results. We
  identified SLNs in patients whose cancers were either in the medial or lateral
  halves of the breast. Average time for SLN dissection was 19 +/- 9 minutes, and
  there were no complications. The diagnostic accuracy of the isosulfan blue dye
  technique for SLN biopsy, 94%, is high enough to warrant further research. The
  lack of complications and the short time needed to perform the technique are
  attractive features. Broader experience with the technique is required to
  evaluate the reliability and reproducibility of this method.

AB: Through the efforts of different laboratories, a battery of immunological
  assays is available to predict the immunotoxicity of xenobiotics. These assays,
  originally developed in rodents, have been adapted for use in a variety of
  animal species and are now used routinely in these models to assess the
  immunotoxicity of different chemical classes. For example, our laboratory has
  employed assays that measure antibody-forming cell response to T-dependent
  antigens, T- and B-cell lymphoproliferation, macrophage function, and host
  resistance against infectious bacteria to assess metal-induced immunotoxicity
  in laboratory-reared Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes); immunologically-related
  assays measuring antioxidant activity have also been used in this capacity.
  Results of the aforementioned investigations have shown the usefulness of these
  endpoints to reliably demonstrate chemical-mediated immunotoxicity in teleost
  systems. Many of these same endpoints have also proved successful for
  predicting the immunotoxic effects of contaminated aquatic environments in
  feral fish populations. For example, smallmouth bass collected from a
  chlorinated hydrocarbon-contaminated site demonstrated significant changes in
  blood cell profiles and kidney phagocyte function compared to fish collected
  from a 'clean water' reference site. Some of these same immune parameters have
  also been used successfully to predict the immunotoxicity of polluted aquatic
  environments in feral populations of fish-eating birds and harbor seals. While
  interspecies extrapolation is difficult and should be approached with caution
  due to variables such as metabolism and pharmacokinetics, results from these
  studies demonstrate the usefulness of these immune assays to predict the
  immunomodulating effects of xenobiotics in fish and other wildlife species, as
  well as the applicability of fish to serve as additional/alternate animal
  models for mammalian species in immunotoxicological studies.

AB: Therapy of melanoma considers the individual prognosis. Primary low-risk
  melanomas with tumor-thickness below 1 mm can be treated by surgery with a
  safety margin of 1 cm. If the tumor-thickness is more than 2 mm the safety
  margin should be 3 cm. Elective lymph node dissection for melanomas at the
  extremities is widely substituted by the sentinel lymph node procedure. This
  new technique shall be applied only in specialised centers in the context of
  clinical trials. After the resection of lymph node metastases adjuvant
  treatment using Interferon-alpha should be considered. Palliative therapy of
  metastases includes surgery, radiotherapy and chemo-immunotherapy depending on
  the number and location of the metastases. Recent progress in understanding the
  immunobiology of melanoma and the development of gene therapy has offered new
  perspectives for future therapeutical intervention including peptide
  vaccination alone or loaded on dendritic cells and gene therapy.

AB: STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess and compare the
  contamination of human breast milk with organochlorine residues through two
  sentinel practice networks in Lower Saxony, a state of former West Germany, and
  Saxony-Anhalt, a state of former East Germany. DESIGN: Eligible women were
  enrolled in this cross sectional study by a network of 51 paediatric practices
  in Lower Saxony and 44 in Saxony-Anhalt when bringing their babies for a
  regular screening examination four to six weeks after delivery.
  Sociodemographic, lifestyle, and exposure factors were determined by
  questionnaire. Milk samples were analysed for hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH),
  hexachlorbenzole (HCB), DDT, dieldrin, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), and
  heptachlorepoxid (HCE); half the samples were also analysed for dioxin.
  Analytic statistics were computed using multiple logistic regression. SETTING:
  The study was conducted in Lower Saxony, Germany, from July 1992 to June 1993,
  and in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, from January to June 1995. PARTICIPANTS: 156
  primiparous, breast-feeding women from Lower Saxony and 113 from Saxony-Anhalt
  were studied, who either were born and raised in former West or East Germany,
  respectively. MAIN RESULT: Mean age of mothers and children differed
  significantly between the two study groups. In Lower Saxony all but two milk
  samples were well below the tolerable concentrations established by the German
  Research Council (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)). In Saxony-Anhalt no
  participant had concentrations above those recommended by the DFG. After
  adjustment for age of mother and child, occupational and non-occupational
  pesticide contact, DDT and beta-HCH concentrations were significantly lower in
  Lower Saxony; HCE and dieldrin concentrations were lower in Saxony-Anhalt. No
  differences between the two states were found for PCB, HCB, gamma-HCH, and
  dioxin. CONCLUSIONS: Breast milk contamination levels in former East German
  Saxony-Anhalt exceeded the contamination in Lower Saxony only for DDT and beta
  -HCH.

AB: Pet and wildlife populations are a potential source of various public health
  problems, and injuries and complications due to animal bites and scratches are
  the most obvious. As no population based data on the frequency of animal bites
  were available at a national level in Switzerland, a study was conducted by the
  Swiss Sentinel Surveillance Network. The objectives of this study were to
  estimate the incidence of medical consultations due to bite and scratch
  injuries in humans caused by vertebrate animals, to identify possible risk
  factors, and to assess bite management habits in primary health care. An annual
  bite and scratch incidence rate of 325 per 100,000 population was estimated.
  Consultations peaked during the summer months and geographical differences in
  the reported incidence were observed. Dogs accounted for more than 60% and cats
  for about 25% of all cases reported. Animal bites and scratches were frequent
  in persons under 20 years of age. In most ages, the incidence was higher among
  women than among men, but not in children under the age of ten years. The
  incidence of cat bites was especially high in adult women. Bites to the head
  and neck were most frequent in infants and young children and accounted for
  approximately one third of the reported cases in this age group. Patients
  sought medical care principally for primary wound care (52.0%) and for
  vaccination advice (29.6%). Rabies postexposure prophylaxis was initiated in
  1.1% of patients. Wound infection was reported in 10.9% of cases, with cat
  bites/scratches being more often infected than injuries due to dogs.
  Hospitalization was reported in 0.3 % of patients. Data from the emergency
  department of two district hospitals showed that head and neck injuries were
  more frequent in out-patients and a higher proportion of persons presented with
  wound infections (14.1%). The hospitalization rate for emergency department
  visits was 4.7%. Animal bites and scratches are common events in Switzerland.
  They represent a public health issue of growing importance due to the steadily
  increasing pet population. A practice based sentinel surveillance system may be
  an appropriate tool to monitor national trends in animal bites and scratches.

AB: This study describes the epidemiology of cocaine and heroin abuse in urban
  Canada as part of an initial report on a national substance abuse surveillance
  system, the Canadian Community Epidemiology Network on Drug Use. Data
  pertaining to prevalence of use, law enforcement, treatment, morbidity and
  mortality of cocaine and heroin were obtained from the appropriate health and
  law enforcement institutions in six sentinel cities: Vancouver, Calgary,
  Winnipeg, Toronto, Montreal and Halifax. Cocaine and heroin appear to be more
  available in Vancouver than in the remaining cities. In all CCENDU cities,
  large proportions of persons in treatment programs for substance abuse
  identified cocaine as their major addiction; however, there is considerable
  variation in treatment utilization regarding heroin. Vancouver ranks first in
  terms of the per capita number of cocaine- and heroin-related hospital
  separations and mortality rate. Cocaine abuse appears to be an emerging problem
  in Calgary, Winnipeg and Halifax, and opiate abuse appears to be an emerging
  problem in Calgary.

AB: There has been considerable public concern that emissions from intensive
  livestock farming may have hazardous effects on human health, particularly on
  the respiratory system. From October 1991 to September 1992, data on
  consultations of asthmatic children (up to 8 years) were obtained by a network
  of 25 GP and paediatric practices in South Oldenburg, a region with one of the
  highest livestock densities in Germany. Comparable data from a similar network
  of 75 practices in 3 adjacent regions (Brunswick, Hanover, Verden) with average
  livestock density served as a reference. In South Oldenberg, 2084 consultations
  of 542 asthmatic children were observed, with asthma being the reason for visit
  in 734 of the contacts (36%). The boy-girl ratio was 2.1:1 among index patients
  and 1.9:1 among consultations. Consultation rate was 25.2 contacts by asthmatic
  children per 1,000 total consultations of children up to 8 years in South
  Oldenburg, compared to 17.8 per 1,000 in Hanover, 15.7 per 1,000 in Brunswick
  and 13.6 per 1,000 in Verden. Consultations due to asthma scored 11.2/1,000 in
  South Oldenburg, 10.8/1,000 in Hanover, 7.2/1,000 in Brunswick and 6.5/1,000 in
  Verden. Asthmatic patients in South Oldenburg were younger (mean age 38 vs. 42
  months) than those observed in the reference regions. There were no regional
  patterns in sex ratio, severity of asthma, respiratory allergies or atopic
  dermatitis. As this is an ecological study design, inferences concerning the
  cause of the observed regional differences can only be weak. We therefore
  propose a case-control study in order to obtain exposure and health data on an
  individual level.

AB: The use of pesticides in agriculture has increased over the last decade.
  Their widespread, often uncontrolled use causes thousands of people to be daily
  exposed to environmental agricultural chemicals, resulting in acute and chronic
  health effects. At present there is a paucity of data on the potential adverse
  effects of exposure to low levels of mancozeb for prolonged periods. In order
  to investigate the effects of mancozeb exposure on pulmonary wildlife
  populations, tracheas and lungs of nine 1- to 7-yr-old nonmigratory pigeons
  raised near peach orchards and vineyards repeatedly sprayed with the fungicide
  were examined. The experimental situation allowed us to evaluate the long-term
  natural toxicity of mancozeb as a sentinel for human populations occupationally
  exposed to fungicides. The use of nonmigratory pigeons may serve as an
  important biological source from which helpful data may be obtained for
  assessing risks to human health and gaining new insight into pathogenetic
  mechanisms.

AB: In 1988, the multicenter project "Information Network of Departments of
  Dermatology (IVDK)", including eight university skin hospitals was founded. It
  now comprises 30 participating centers. At these centers, all patch test
  results are recorded, together with important anamnestic details and, twice a
  year, these are sent to the data center at the Gottingen University Skin
  Hospital. Regular, descriptive analyses of data collected by this
  epidemiological surveillance system serve the different purposes discussed in
  this paper: 1) observation of "sentinel events"; e.g. an increase in the
  proportion of patients tested who were sensitized to a certain allergen, or the
  identification of certain subgroups at particular risk as a starting point for
  further research or preventive action, and 2) advancement of good clinical
  practice in patch testing. In October 1996, a working group of the European
  Society of Contact Dermatitis (ESCD) called the "European Surveillance System
  on Contact Allergies (ESSCA)" was established with a similar aim of communal
  data collection and analysis.

AB: We specify the relations among the major parameters involved in using
  sentinel animals to monitor arbovirus transmission. By using probability
  models, first we demonstrate that vector density, infection rate, incubation
  period of sentinel animals, the number of sentinel animals used, and blood
  sampling frequency could directly affect the observed seroconversion rates and
  the comparison of these rates. Second, we evaluate the reliability of using
  sentinel animals to monitor arbovirus transmission under various conditions. On
  the basis of the model, we propose some measures for enhancing the reliability
  of using sentinel animals to monitor arbovirus. Third, we present a formula for
  estimating the number of sentinel animals used for a study designed to compare
  seroconversion rates. Fourth, we derive a necessary condition for deciding the
  blood sample frequency of sentinel animals. Fifth, we develop a formula that
  could be used to obtain the vector infection rate by using seroconversion data.
  Finally, we evaluate the epidemiology consequences of heterogeneous exposure of
  human hosts to vectors by theoretical modeling.

AB: To determine the contaminants that should be studied further in the
  subsequent population-based study, a profile of Great Lakes (GL) sport fish
  contaminant residues were studied in human blood and urine specimens from 32
  sport fish consumers from three Great Lakes: Lake Michigan (n = 10), Lake Huron
  (n = 11), and Lake Erie (n = 11). Serum was analyzed for 8 polychlorinated
  dioxin congeners, 10 polychlorinated furan congeners, 4 coplanar and 32 other
  polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners, and 11 persistent chlorinated
  pesticides. Whole blood was analyzed for mercury and lead. Urine samples were
  analyzed for 10 nonpersistent pesticides (or their metabolites) and 5 metals.
  One individual was excluded from statistical analysis because of an unusual
  exposure to selected analytes. Overall, the sample (n = 31) consumed, on
  average, 49 GL sport fish meals per year for a mean of 33 years. On average,
  the general population in the GL basin consume 6 meals of GL sport fish per
  year. The mean tissue levels of most persistent, bioaccumulative compounds also
  found in GL sport fish ranged from less than a twofold increase to that of PCB
  126, which was eight times the selected background levels found in the general
  population. The overall mean total toxic equivalent for dioxins, furans, and
  coplanar PCBs were greater than selected background levels in the general
  population (dioxins, 1.8 times; furans, 2.4 times; and coplanar PCBs, 9.6
  times). The nonpersistent pesticides and most metals were not identified in
  unusual concentrations. A contaminant pattern among lake subgroups was evident.
  Lake Erie sport fish consumers had consistently lower contaminant
  concentrations than consumers of sport fish from Lake Michigan and Huron. These
  interlake differences are consistent with contaminant patterns seen in sport
  fish tissue from the respective lakes; GL sport fish consumption was the most
  likely explanation for observed contaminant levels among this sample. Frequent
  consumers of sport fish proved to be effective sentinels for identifying sport
  fish contaminants of concern. In the larger study to follow, serum samples will
  be tested for PCBs (congener specific and coplanar), DDE, dioxin, and furans.

AB: Between 1980 and 1994, 423 patients with esophageal cancer were given
  curative radiation therapy. Of these patients, 31 died of massive hemorrhage
  and were used as the subjects of analysis in this study. The incidence of
  massive hemorrhage in all patients was 7% (31/423). In the 31 patients who died
  of massive hemorrhage, 27 had local tumors and two had no tumors at hemorrhage
  (two unknown cases). The mean time interval from the start of radiation to
  hemorrhage was 9.2 months. In 9 autopsy cases the origin of hemorrhage was a
  tear of the aorta in 5 cases, necrotic local tumor in 3 cases and esophageal
  ulcer in 1 case. The positive risk factors for this complication seemed to be
  excess total dose, infection, metallic stent, and tracheoesophageal fistula.
  Chest pain or sentinel hemorrhage proceeding to massive hemorrhage was observed
  in about half of the patients.

  monoxide poisoning, acute chemical poisoning, and methemoglobinemia, in at
  least 35 states (baseline: 0 states in 1990) (objective 11.16). To assess
  progress toward this objective, the Council of State and Territorial
  Epidemiologists (CSTE), the Association of Schools of Public Health, and CDC
  conducted a telephone survey of environmental epidemiologists in each of the 50
  states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico during June-August 1997. This
  report summarizes the results of that survey, which indicate that progress is
  being made toward the HP2000 objective.

AB: In this paper we analyse the problems related to the "state of the art" in
  the treatment of stage I and II breast cancer which has become, in Italy too,
  an increasingly prominent problem: it is the most frequently diagnosed female
  cancer, accounting for about 45,000 new cases/year (150/100,000 women). In the
  last decade the approach to this disease has greatly evolved because of new
  surgical techniques, advances in adjuvant medical therapies, innovations in the
  field of radiotherapy, and wider use of biological parameters. We emphasize the
  emerging problem of ductal and lobular carcinoma in situ, because their
  biological patterns will be better identified and the related treatment
  extensively practiced in the next future. The innovations in surgery, which has
  now a less demolishing role, are reviewed focusing on the "sentinel axillary
  node" and the actual need for axillary dissection. In relation to chemotherapy
  (CT), we evaluate the role of adjuvant treatment also in node negative
  patients, and the impact of neoadjuvant schedules on survival and toxicity.
  Radiotherapy (RT) is complementary to conservative surgery, and its important
  role in preventing local relapse and in increasing OS (overall survival) has
  been established; recent and more sophisticated techniques have reduced its
  acute and late toxicity. We are however waiting for answers concerning the
  usefulness of a booster dose, the impact of RT on local relapse in DCIS, and
  the impact of RT to the breast regional lymph nodes on OS and disease-free
  survival (DFS). The optimal sequencing and timing of postoperative RT and CT
  are unknown, both concerning each other and surgery. Some possibilities include
  giving all planned CT before RT, all CT after RT, giving both concurrently, or
  giving a portion of CT before RT and then completing CT afterwards (sandwich
  technique): we analyse the advantages and the problems of these different
  therapeutic schedules in relation to the OS, the DFS and cosmesis. In
  conclusion, there are very few certainties to guide us in the clinical
  practice: the general feeling is that we need to collect more data on
  homogeneous groups of patients to better understand which are the prognostic
  factors we can rely on, in order to choose the best treatment strategy, and
  which are the optimal schedules of adjuvant treatments (CT and RT), with the
  aim of improving OS, DFS and cosmesis.

AB: A tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) patient has not been reported for many years
  in Japan although a serological survey of domestic animal sera suggested the
  presence of TBE foci in Hokkaido, the northern island of Japan. In October 1993
  in Hokkaido, a severe encephalitis case in a farm wife was diagnosed as tick
  -borne encephalitis. Serological examination of paired sera showed a rise of
  neutralization (NT) antibody titer to Russian spring summer encephalitis virus.
  A sero-epizootiological survey of dogs showed that the TBE-related virus was
  prevalent in the area. Three virus isolates were obtained from the blood of
  sentinel dogs and the antigenic analysis grouped the isolates into TBE-related
  viruses. Sequence analysis of envelope protein gene identified one of the
  isolates as the same subtype as Russian spring summer encephalitis (Far-Eastern
  TBE) virus. The results provide the evidence that TBE is endemic in a certain
  area of Japan.

  (Comet) assay to evaluate the in vivo genotoxicity of two potent rodent bladder
  carcinogens, o-anisidine and p-cresidine, in mouse liver, lung, kidney, brain,
  and bone marrow, and in the mucosa of stomach, colon, and bladder. Male CD-1
  mice (8 weeks old) were sacrificed 3 and 24 h after oral administration of o
  -anisidine at 690 mg/kg or p-cresidine at 595 mg/kg. Both chemicals were
  dissolved in olive oil. Both chemicals yielded statistically significant DNA
  damage in bladder mucosa 3 and 24 h after treatment. o-Anisidine yielded DNA
  damage in the colon at 3 h, but not at 24 h. No significant effects were
  observed in any other organs. Our results suggest the importance of the urinary
  bladder as a sentinel organ for evaluating chemical genotoxicity in rodents.

AB: CONTEXT: The sex ratio of 1.06:1, the ratio of male to female births, has
  declined over the past decades. Recent reports from a number of industrialized
  countries indicate that the proportion of males born has significantly
  decreased, while some male reproductive tract disorders have increased.
  OBJECTIVES: To examine the evidence for declines in the male proportion at
  birth and suspected causes for this decline, and to determine whether altered
  sex ratio can be considered a sentinel health event. DATA SOURCES: Birth
  records were analyzed from national statistical agencies. STUDY SELECTION:
  Published analyses of trends in ratio of males to females at birth and studies
  of sex determinants evaluating epidemiological and endocrinological factors.
  DATA EXTRACTION: Proportion of males born: 1950-1994 in Denmark; 1950-1994 in
  the Netherlands; 1970-1990 in Canada; and 1970-1990 in the United States. DATA
  SYNTHESIS: Since 1950, significant declines in the proportion of males born
  have been reported in Denmark and the Netherlands. Similar declines have been
  reported for Canada and the United States since 1970 and parallel declines also
  have occurred in Sweden, Germany, Norway, and Finland. In Denmark, the
  proportion of males declined from 0.515 in 1950 to 0.513 in 1994. In the
  Netherlands, the proportion of males declined from 0.516 in 1950 to 0.513 in
  1994. Similar declines in the proportion of males born in Canada and the United
  States are equivalent to a shift from male to female births of 8600 and 38000
  births, respectively. Known and hypothesized risk factors for reduced sex ratio
  at birth cannot fully account for recent trends. CONCLUSION: Patterns of
  reduced sex ratio need to be carefully assessed to determine whether they are
  occurring more generally, whether temporal or spatial variations are evident,
  and whether they constitute a sentinel health event.

AB: A follow-up study was undertaken to determine the predictors of the course
  of recurrent wheezing episodes in children (between 0 to 8 years). In 1991, 600
  children with wheezing episodes had been recorded by physicians who
  participated in a sentinel practice network. On each consultation with the same
  physicians from October 1994 until June 1995, parents of these children were
  questioned again about the course of their respiratory symptoms (n = 218).
  Associations between the course of disease and predictors (recorded by
  physicians in 1991) were analysed using polytomous logistic regression. The
  following factors were significantly associated with the frequency of asthmatic
  episodes (odds ratio (OR) > 1 indicates an unfavourable course of disease in
  comparison with the reference category, [95% confidence interval]): indoor
  cigarette smoking: OR = 1.7; [1.0-3.0], older than 1 year of age (reference:

AB: The production of mutations in cellular tumor suppressor genes such as p53
  is involved in the development of many human cancers. These mutations result in
  the expression of mutant forms of the encoded p53 protein which can potentially
  serve as a biomarker for this carcinogenic process. Workers exposed to vinyl
  chloride who are at risk for the development of the sentinel neoplasm
  angiosarcoma of the liver represent a model population for the study of such a
  mutant p53 biomarker, since vinyl chloride is known to cause specific p53
  mutations in persons with angiosarcoma of the liver. To determine the relation
  between vinyl chloride exposure and this p53 biomarker, the authors examined
  serum samples collected between 1987 and 1992 from a cohort of 225 French vinyl
  chloride workers and 111 unexposed controls (matched according to age, sex,
  race, smoking, and alcohol drinking) for the presence of mutant p53 protein,
  using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Stratification of the exposed
  workers by quartile of vinyl chloride exposure (in estimated ppm-years) yielded
  a statistically significant trend of increasing odds ratios for p53 biomarker
  seropositivity with increasing exposure. These results suggest that this serum
  biomarker for mutant p53 protein is related to vinyl chloride exposure and may
  be an early indicator of carcinogenic risk in exposed individuals.

AB: In recent years much attention has been focused on the potential for a wide
  range of xenobiotic chemicals to interact with and disrupt the endocrine
  systems of animal and human populations. An overview of the chemicals that have
  been implicated as endocrine disruptors is presented. The ubiquity in the
  environment and associated body burdens of these chemicals in human populations
  are described. Potential mechanisms of action are reviewed, including the role
  of specific intracellular receptors and their interactions with endogenous and
  exogenous materials. The subsequent upregulation or downregulation of
  physiological processes at critical stages of development is discussed. The
  potential for joint toxic action and interaction of chemical mixtures is also
  discussed. The acknowledged role of wildlife populations as sentinels of
  potential human health effects is reviewed, and the weight of evidence for the
  role and impact of endocrine disruptors is presented. The implications of
  exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals for human health are reviewed, with
  special emphasis on the potential for transgenerational effects in at-risk
  populations. Recommendations for future research include the development of (1)
  structural activity and in vivo and in vitro functional toxicology methods to
  screen chemicals for their endocrine-disrupting ability, (2) biomarkers of
  exposure and effect, and (3) in situ sentinel systems.

  mullet Liza aurata sampled in Barcelona harbour and the mullet Mullus barbatus
  sampled along the coast; different tissues (muscle, liver, gills and digestive
  tube) were analysed separately. The composition of butyltin compounds was
  different according to the organism and sampling point, but in general elevated
  concentrations of TBT were noticed in molluscs. The highest organotin residue
  levels (5.4 Mug/g d.w. as Sn) were detected in mussels from Masnou, a
  recreational marina, followed by those collected in Barcelona harbour (1.2
  Mug/g d.w. as Sn). In contrast, no organotin compounds were detected in fish
  muscle and very low levels in the other organs, being TPT the major organotin
  in red mullet liver.

AB: This is the 1st part of a 4-part series on foodborne disease surveillance.
  Articles are primarily built on expertise gained within North America but data
  are of value to any community or country wishing to initiate or improve
  surveillance systems. Surveillance is necessary for preventing further spread
  of disease and includes identifying and controlling outbreaks at the time they
  occur; gathering data on incidence of diseases and prevalence of etiologic
  agents, vehicles and reservoirs; identifying factors leading to outbreaks;
  providing a data bank for HACCP systems and risk assessments; estimating health
  and economic impacts; and providing information as the basis for rational food
  safety program goals and priorities. Reports of outbreaks by local health
  agencies to regional and national agencies responsible for disease
  surveillance, laboratory isolations of foodborne pathogens from human beings,
  sentinel community studies and hazard surveillance are the types of activities
  used to varying extents in Canada and the US. In recent yr, some national
  surveillance reports were collated internationally in Europe and Latin America.
  Surveillance at local, state/provincial, national and international levels must
  be coordinated for effective and rapid transfer of data. Computer software can
  assist investigation and management of information submitted through
  surveillance networks. Information summarized on individual reports usually
  includes: location of events; clinical data; epidemiologic data; laboratory
  findings; and results of on-site investigations. Each outbreak report should be
  subjected to critical review before classifying it into various categories of
  surveillance data. Such a review would also be useful when comparing
  surveillance data from different places and intervals. Highlights of individual
  reports are tabulated as line listings that are direct sources of surveillance
  data (subject of the 2nd and 3rd parts of this series). [See following abstr.

  types in which ligands occurred and relative abundance and distribution of

  metal pollution (based on metal/shell-wt. indices). [See preceding abstr. for

  gills, kidney and remaining soft tissue) by AAS. Results (tables and graphs)
  are discussed in sections covering wt. changes, body burdens and tissue

  metal uptake, storage, mobilization and excretion appeared to be performed by
  different cell types in the different organs. Only low levels of Cu exposure
  (<8 Mug Cu l-1 water) triggered a regulatory mechanism, whereas Zn was well

  suitability of winkles as indicators of Cu/Zn pollution should be reconsidered
  and a different analytical approach (based on metal burdens in target cells)
  applied. [See following abstr. for part II.]

AB: Biological assessment is useful in addition to conventional chemical
  analyses to monitor the water quality. Biochemical markers are early warning
  systems of the exposition of aquatic organisms to pollutants. Among them, the
  measurement of the fish EROD induction enables the detection of PAHs, PCBs and
  dioxines. The biomarker was used as a fitted tool in numerous limited field
  studies. Yet, in a large scale biomonitoring perspective, it is necessary to
  determine baseline values in sentinel fish species as well as to precisely
  quantify the biotic and abiotic sources of variability. Cyprinids were thus
  sampled in the Rhone river watershed in low polluted and in polluted areas.
  Reference baseline EROD activities were calculated for three species: barbel,
  chub and gudgeon. The data from the polluted sites were related to
  contamination and female sexual maturity. In the same way, laboratory
  experiments provided information on the effect of the level of the inducer, the
  influence of the sexual maturity as well as the sensitivity and reversibility
  of the EROD induction. The immunodetection of the cytochrome P450 1A protein
  provided better assessment of results where an inhibition effect could have
  occured. With all results, a classification of the EROD levels was proposed
  through statistical analysis of the EROD distributional properties. Both
  measurement and interpretation of the EROD biomarker are then mature enough to
  begin a normalisation procedure in a biomonitoring perspective.

AB: The extent of autometallographical black silver deposits (BSD) was
  quantified by automated image analysis in digestive lysosomes of the digestive
  gland of mussels collected from 2 estuaries of the coast of Biscay for 1 yr.
  Additionally, metal composition of digestive lysosomes was characterised by X
  -ray microprobe analysis. Zn levels were the most variable among the metals
  analysed by AAS (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn, Pb, Fe). A logarithmic regression model
  explained the changes in volume density (VD) of BSD by changes in the Zn/shell
  -wt index recorded in mussels from different sites of the coast. Similar
  regression models were obtained between the VD of BSD and metal/shell-wt
  indices resulting from pooling the 7 metals ( mu mol metal/g dry shell weight).
  In conclusion, metal bioavailability can be estimated by analysing the VD of
  BSD in the digestive lysosomes of sentinel mussels. This index may allow
  workers to discard chemical analysis of biological samples when low traces of
  metals are present in the tissues, since the method proposed herein provides a
  quick and cost-effective alternative to routine chemical analyses in
  biomonitoring programmes. Only when values of VD of BSD reach the plateau of
  the function would a more accurate chemical analysis be required. This approach
  does not require special facilities or specialised technicians and would reduce
  the time and cost of routine metal determination in water pollution monitoring
  programmes.

AB: Predation on eggs of codling moth, Cydia pomonella L., was assessed in
  Washington in June and August, 1995 in eight apple orchards treated with
  organophosphate insecticides (OPs), four orchards treated with mating
  disruption (MD) and some OPs, and four treated with MD but not with OPs.
  Sentinel codling moth eggs laid by caged moths on 10 shoots in each orchard
  were scored as alive, dead, or missing after 7 d, and beating tray samples of
  arthropod predators were collected at the beginning and end of each trial.
  Levels of egg predation (dead + missing eggs) did not differ significantly
  among orchard types in June but varied among orchard types in August (MD alone
  > MD + OPs > OPs). The percentage of dead eggs in August was significantly
  higher in the orchards receiving only MD than in orchards treated only with
  OPs. The percentage of missing eggs was significantly lower both months in
  orchards not treated with MD. Densities of spiders and all predators on both
  sample dates and for earwigs in August were significantly higher in orchards
  not treated with OPs. Densities of heteropteran predators did not vary
  significantly by orchard type. No significant correlations were found among
  predator densities and egg mortality within an orchard type. However, the
  percentages of dead eggs and dead plus missing eggs were significantly and
  positively correlated with densities of earwigs, spiders, and all predators in
  tray samples across the 16 orchards.

AB: An important challenge in modelling the human immunodeficiency virus
  (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic is to use the
  increasing quantity of disease surveillance data to validate estimates and
  forecasts. Presented is a novel model for forecasting HIV incidence by age and
  sex and among sentinel groups for which data are available. This approach
  permits a closer relationship between forecasting and surveillance activities,
  and more accurate estimates validated to data. As inputs the model uses an
  estimate of the HIV prevalence, country demographic data, and a profile of the
  sexual risk of HIV infection by age, to project HIV incidence, prevalence,
  number of AIDS cases and population. The following examples of the use of the
  model are given: forecasting HIV incidence in East Africa, by age, sex, and
  among pregnant women; 3-5-year forecasts of HIV incidence; modelling mixed risk
  behaviour HIV epidemics in South-east Asia; demographic indicators; and
  targeting a preventive vaccine by age group.

AB: The variations in hemolymph parameters in marine bivalves were monitored in
  both laboratory and field after exposure of animals to different metallic and
  organic pollutants. In the laboratory, experimental modification of cytometric
  parameters produced physiological changes in the hemolymph. Exposure of oysters
  to sub-lethal doses of metal ions, cadmium and copper resulted in an increase
  in total hemocyte counts (THC), a phenomenon often observed under pathological
  conditions, and in important shifts in differential hemocyte counts (DHC).
  Spontaneous hemocyte aggregation (SHA), which acts to maintain the integrity of
  the body, was altered in oysters and mussels following in vitro contact of the
  hemocytes with metal ions or with the biocide tributyltin (TBT). These effects
  on SHA were observed to be dependent on the applied concentration of the
  particular micropollutant. In the field, the measurement of THC, DHC and SHA in
  transplanted mussels revealed responses at the most exposed sites (mouth of
  Elorn, Bay of Daoulas, harbour area). The serum of wild oysters and clams from
  exposed sites had increased levels of cellular peptidase reflecting sub
  -cellular modifications such as lysosome destabilisation. The modifications in
  hemolymphatic parameters, demonstrated in this study, are likely to have
  reduced immune system performance, and therefore are considered to indicate a
  state of immunomodulation. These changes in the immune system in bivalves in
  polluted areas, relative to those at control sites, indicate that measurement
  of hemolymphatic parameters in sentinel species should be strongly considered
  in monitoring of marine ecosystem under human impact.

AB: Blooms of Alexandrium spp. and their associated family of saxitoxins known
  as paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) are endemic to the Pacific and Atlantic
  coasts of Canada. Filter-feeding shellfish accumulate the toxic algae and, when
  ingested by humans, the resultant PSP can cause respiratory failure and death.
  Toxicity records from sentinel species of bivalve shellfish on the Pacific
  coast have demonstrated spatial, seasonal and yearly variation in toxic bloom
  events. On the Atlantic coast PSP toxicity occurs mainly in the St. Lawrence
  estuary, the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the Bay of Fundy. Periodicity is evident
  in the latter, but in the estuary and gulf of the St. Lawrence, outbreaks are
  less regular and less predictable, making them difficult to monitor. Amnesic
  shellfish poisoning (ASP) from species of Pseudo-nitzschia was identified for
  the first time ever on the Atlantic coast of Canada in 1987. The causative
  agent, domoic acid, is an excitatory neurotoxin that can cause memory loss and
  death. Monitoring ASP toxicity on the Pacific coast has resulted in annual
  closures of crab and bivalve molluscan fisheries. Species of Dinophysis and
  Prorocentrum associated with the production of okadaic acid and its analogues
  known as diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) occur on both coasts. There have
  been a few sporadic outbreaks of toxicity on the Atlantic, but none recorded
  from the Pacific coast. Toxic Heterosigma carterae is a major killer of farmed
  salmon on the Pacific coast, with the causative agent associated with the
  production of oxygen radicals. Physical obstruction to the gills of farmed
  salmon from the non-toxic diatoms Chaetoceros convolutus, C. concavicornis,
  Corethron criophilum, Skeletonema costatum and Thalassiosira spp. have caused
  death from excess mucus formation and anoxia. Other species, such as the
  prymnesiophyte Chrysochromulina polylepis, the diatom Leptocylindrus minimus
  and the silicoflagellate Dictyocha speculum that have caused similar problems
  elsewhere have been recorded in low numbers. Dense blooms of other non-toxic
  algae such as Gonyaulax spinifera have caused death of intertidal bivalve
  molluscs from smothering and anoxia resulting from the biological oxygen demand
  of senescent cells. Toxic and harmful algae continue to have adverse socio
  -economic impact on the traditional and aquaculture fisheries and on fishing
  communities. Whether the apparent world-wide proliferation of toxic and harmful
  phytoplankton reflects and increased awareness and scrutiny of bloom events or
  is the result of environmental stresses from human activities has yet to be
  confirmed.

AB: We tested the hypothesis that red colobus monkeys, Procolobus badius, and
  Diana monkeys, Cercopithecus diana, in Taie National Park, Ivory Coast,
  associate to increase safety from predation. We recorded stratum use, exposure
  and vigilance of each species in the presence and in the absence of the partner
  species. In the presence of Diana monkeys, red colobus used lower strata more
  often, were more exposed to the forest floor and looked down less often while
  foraging. This suggests that red colobus reduce predation pressure from ground
  predators by associating with Diana. There are several indications that both
  species are less vulnerable to birds of prey when associated: red colobus
  looked sideways less often and were more exposed to the front, Diana monkeys
  used greater heights and were more exposed to the front, to the rear and from
  above. We also asked whether specific sentinel qualities of Diana monkeys might
  explain why other sympatric monkey species additionally seek their presence.
  When groups of various species compositions were approached by an observer, or
  confronted with an eagle model, Diana monkeys raised the alarm in most cases.
  Since neither monkey species improves its foraging success when associated,
  this study shows that predation can both maintain and be the ultimate cause of
  interspecific associations.

  1991 to June 1995, 4030 foreigners with a new STD episode were reported. More
  than one-third of them were North-Africans. The most frequent STDs were non
  -specific urethritis and genital warts among men, and non-specific vaginitis
  and latent syphilis among women. The overall HIV prevalence was 5%, with large
  differences in rates in people from different continents. Very high HIV
  -positivity rates were observed among homosexuals and homosexual IDUs from
  Central-south America, with 39.1% and 77.8% seropositive individuals
  respectively. These data stress the need for increased knowledge of both the
  spread of and risk factors for STDs among immigrants. Particular attention
  should be paid to counselling procedures focused on the prevention of risk

AB: The nasal cavity is the most common portal of entry to the human body and a
  well-known target site for a wide range of air pollutants and chemically
  induced toxicity and carcinogenicity. DNA single-strand breaks (SSB) can be
  used as a biomarker of oxidant exposure and as an indicator of the
  carcinogenicity and mutagenicity of a substance. We examined the utility of
  using the alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis assay (SCGE) for measuring
  DNA damage in children's nasal epithelium exposed to air pollutants. We studied
  148 children, ages 6-12, including 19 control children from a low polluted
  Pacific port and 129 children from Southwest Metropolitan Mexico City, an urban
  polluted area with high ozone concentrations year-round. Three sets of two
  nasal biopsies were taken in a 3-month period. All exposed children had upper
  respiratory symptoms and DNA damage in their nasal cells. Eleven- and twelve
  -year-olds had the most DNA damage, and more than 30% of children aged 9-12
  exhibited patchy areas of squamous metaplasia over high-flow nasal regions.
  These areas had the greatest numbers of damaged DNA cells (P less than or equal
  to 0.001) and a large number of DNA tails > 80 mu m (P < 0.001) when compared
  to the contralateral macroscopically normal site in the same child. The
  youngest children with significantly less outdoor exposure displayed patchy
  areas of goblet cell hyperplasia and had the least DNA damage. These findings
  suggest that SCGE can be used to monitor DNA damage in children's nasal
  epithelium and, further, the identification of DNA damage in nasal
  proliferative epithelium could be regarded as a sentinel lesion, most likely
  due to severe and sustained cell injury.

AB: Nests of pigeon guillemots (Cepphus columba) were located along the south
  shore of Kachemak Bay, Alaska, and monitored during the breeding seasons of
  1994 and 1995. Rates of nestling growth were measured and blood samples were
  collected for measurements of serum biomarkers. Haptoglobin, total protein,
  alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and sodium in sera were
  measured as potential biomarkers of oil ingestion. Differences in mean levels
  of biomarkers were observed between years, and between nestlings and adults, as
  well as among locations within Kachemak Bay. During summer 1995, a controlled
  dose-response experiment was conducted with weathered Prudhoe Bay Crude Oil.
  Fifty-one nestlings were divided into three groups: controls, nestlings fed
  0.05 ml of oil, and nestlings fed 0.20 ml of oil. Each experimental nestling
  was fed the dose of weathered oil twice: once at approximately day 20, and
  again 5 days later at approximately day 25 post-hatching. Blood samples were
  collected immediately before dosing on days 20, 25, and again on day 30 post
  -hatching. Site-specific differences in some blood variables were observed
  among treatments. These results suggest that the doses of weathered oil
  administered to guillemot nestlings were not sufficient to induce a persistent
  inflammatory response.

AB: The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate models for public
  health surveillance of illnesses among children in out-of-home child care
  facilities. Between July 1992 and March 1994, 200 Seattle-King County child
  care facilities participated in active or enhanced passive surveillance, or
  both. Reporting was based on easily recognized signs, symptoms, and sentinel
  events. Published criteria were used in evaluating surveillance effectiveness,
  and notifiable disease reporting of participating and nonparticipating
  facilities was compared. Neither surveillance model was well accepted by child
  care providers. Enhanced passive and active surveillance had comparable
  sensitivity. Reporting delays and the large amount of time needed for data
  entry led to problems with timeliness, especially in terms of written reporting
  during active surveillance. Widespread active public health surveillance in
  child care facilities is not feasible for most local health departments.
  Improvements in public health surveillance in child care settings will depend
  on acceptability to providers.

AB: This is the first part of a four-part series on foodborne disease
  surveillance. Although these articles are primarily built on expertise gained
  within North America, the substance is of value to any community or country
  wishing to initiate or improve its surveillance system. Foodborne disease
  surveillance is necessary for preventing further spread of foodborne disease
  and includes identifying and controlling outbreaks at the time they are
  occurring; gathering data on incidence of these diseases and prevalence of
  their etiologic agents, vehicles, and reservoirs; identifying factors that led
  to the outbreaks; providing a data bank for HACCP systems and risk assessments;
  estimating health and economic impacts of foodborne diseases; and providing
  information upon which to base rational food safety program goals and
  priorities. Reports of outbreaks by local health agencies to regional and,
  then, national agencies responsible for disease surveillance, laboratory
  isolations of certain foodborne pathogens from human beings, sentinel community
  studies, and hazard surveillance are the types of foodborne disease
  surveillance activities that are used to varying extents in Canada and the U.S.
  In recent years, some national surveillance reports have been collated
  internationally in Europe and Latin America. Surveillance at local,
  state/provincial, national, and international levels must be coordinated for
  effective and rapid transfer of data. Computer software can assist
  investigation and management of the information submitted through surveillance
  networks. Information summarized on individual reports usually includes (a)
  location of the event, (b) clinical data, (c) epidemiologic data, (d)
  laboratory findings, and (e) results of on-site investigations. Each outbreak
  report should be subjected to critical review before classifying it into the
  various categories of surveillance data. Such a review would also be useful
  when comparing surveillance data from different places and intervals.
  Highlights of individual reports are tabulated as line listings that are the
  direct sources of surveillance data, which are the subject of the second and
  third parts of this series.

AB: Egg parasitoids of the genus Trichogramma are commonly released in
  inundative biological control programmes for lepidopteran pests in a range of
  cropping systems. In this study we evaluated the dispersal of Trichogramma
  platneri from a central release point in an apple orchard in relation to time
  and the number of parasitoids released. Dispersal was monitored by parasitism
  of codling moth eggs from an insectary culture - used as sentinel eggs. Higher
  release rates of T. platneri resulted in greater parasitism of sentinel eggs
  during the first 3 days, increasing from about 18% for a release rate of 5400
  to about 36% for a release rate of 32 400. T. platneri parasitized a greater
  percentage of sentinel eggs on the north side of the tree. Parasitism of
  sentinel eggs declined by 50% during the second 3 day period following release
  from a point source release in comparison to the first 3 day period. Parasitism
  of sentinel eggs declined from a mean of 62% at the point source to less than
  10% 14 m away during the first 3 days after release.

AB: Since the advent of ecological risk assessment, there has been insufficient
  time to develop a consensus that guides its use in science-based policy
  activities. As a part of risk assessment, science and policy have been combined
  to create several myths that hold important consequences for environmental
  decision making. These myths - a "sensitive," or "sentinel," species can be
  selected and appropriately used; chronic data are better suited to regulatory
  needs than are acute data; and controlled experimental data can be accurately
  extrapolated to the field - continue because of failures to clearly distinguish
  between the roles and uses of science and policy. Though possibly useful from a
  policy perspective, these myths are not scientifically valid. Issues of
  representativeness, lack of ecological knowledge, and variability question
  their scientific foundation. Science has played an important part in developing
  assessment techniques, but it cannot address all the issues surrounding
  environmental risk management. Policy must be used to make management-related
  decisions. Therefore, the most important role for science is the provision of
  information to be used in environmental decision making.

DE: models-; game-theory; mutualism-; vigilance-; animals-
AB: Sentinels are group members that watch from prominent positions. Sentinel
  interchanges often appear orderly, and groups with sentinels rarely have zero
  or many sentinels. A dynamic game was constructed to examine if these
  observations about sentinels could be based on selfish actions by individual
  group members. In this game, each group member chose to forage or be a sentinel
  based on its own energetic state and the actions of others. Sentinels received
  a selfish antipredator benefit if their ability to detect approaching predators
  more than compensated for their increased exposure to undetected predators.
  Provided sentinels were relatively safe and that detection information spread
  to other group members when sentinels detected predators, sentinels appeared
  highly coordinated for all combinations of parameters. This apparent
  coordination was based on mutualism because each individual gained by being a
  sentinel when other group members were not (and foraging when other group
  members were being sentinels). The model was very robust, but exact level of
  sentinel behavior varied somewhat with changes in foraging and predation
  parameters. This model could best be tested by testing its assumptions about
  sentinel safety, foraging-predation trade-offs, and information transfer in
  groups.

AB: Laboratory assays were used to compare the ability of commercially produced
  Trichogramma spp. to parasitize eggs of the obliquebanded leafroller,
  Choristoneura rosaceana (Harris), in the laboratory and field. Trichogramma
  platneri Nagarkatti parasitized more obliquebanded leafroller eggs per egg mass
  than did Trichogramma pretiosum Riley or Trichogramma minutum Riley produced by
  either of 2 insectaries. T. minutum produced at 1 insectary caused
  significantly more host mortality by host feeding and repiercing than by
  parasitism. Variation in parasitoid performance from different insectaries and
  among shipments from the same insectary was common. Young egg masses were more
  heavily parasitized than old egg masses. Parasitism increased as the number of
  conspecific female Trichogramma spp. placed on the same host increased, but the
  number of eggs parasitized per female decreased. Exposure of host egg masses to
  female Trichogramma spp. prevented additional oviposition in the same egg mass
  by conspecific, ovipositionally experienced females but had no effect on
  parasitism by conspecific, ovipositionally naive females. The method used to
  attach sentinel egg masses to foliage influenced parasitism rates. Moistening
  the leaf with water and adhering the egg mass to the moistened leaf had the
  least impact. Inundative releases of Trichogramma spp. into an apple orchard
  paralleled laboratory assays by showing greater parasitism of obliquebanded
  leafroller egg masses by T. platneri than with T. minutum. However, extreme
  differences observed in field performance between the 2 species was not
  predicted from the assays.

AB: Trichogramma ostriniae (Hym: Trichogrammatidae), an egg parasitoid of the
  European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Lep: Pyralidae), were released into
  sweet corn (Zea mays L.) fields to study the effects of weather, plant size and
  distribution of egg masses on egg parasitism by the wasp. Sentinel European
  corn borer eggs were stapled onto leaves located in the upper, middle and lower
  third of sweet corn plants 5 to 35 meters away from the wasp release point in
  either a radial or grid manner. Weather conditions and plant architecture were
  monitored during the experiments. Logistic regression was used to analyze the
  data. The results indicated that percentage of eggs parasitized was negatively
  related to an increase in leaf area as well as an increase in distance eggs
  were located from the point of release of wasps. Eggs distributed on plants at
  different directions from the release point received different levels of
  parasitism. Eggs that were stapled onto leaves in the upper third of a corn
  plant received much less parasitism than those on the middle and lower third of
  the plant. Higher mean temperature adversely affected the level of parasitism
  during hotter times of the season and conversely, lower temperatures (<17
  degree C) reduced the egg parasitism during cooler times of the season. The
  longer the exposure of eggs to wasps, the higher the level of egg parasitism.
  However, the levels of egg parasitism for 2 day's exposure were almost the same
  as that for 3 day's exposure due to the limited longevity and egg-laying
  behavior of the wasp. These results suggest that inundative releases of T.
  ostriniae should be made every two to three days, with multiple release points
  per hectare. In addition, weather conditions and plant architecture, especially
  temperature, plant height and leaf area must be taken into consideration to
  optimize levels of parasitism.

AB: We monitored lead poisoning from the ingestion of spent lead pellets in
  sentinel mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) at the Sacramento National Wildlife
  Refuge (SNWR), Willows, California for 4 years (1986-89) after the conversion
  to steel shot for waterfowl hunting on refuges in 1986. Sentinel mallards were
  held in 1.6-ha enclosures in 1 hunted (P8) and 2 non-hunted (T19 and TF)
  wetlands. We compared site-specific rates of lead exposure, as determined by
  periodic measurement of blood lead concentrations, and lead poisoning mortality
  between wetlands with different lead pellet densities, between seasons, and
  between male and female sentinels. In 1986, the estimated 2-week rate of lead
  exposure was significantly higher (P < 0.005) in P8 (43.8%), the wetland with
  the highest density of spent lead pellets (>2,000,000 pellets/ha), than in
  those with lower densities of lead pellets, T19 (18.1%; 173,200 pellets/ha) and
  TF(0.9%; 15,750 pellets/ha). The probability of mortality from lead poisoning
  was also significant higher (P < 0.01) in sentinel mallards enclosure in P8
  (0.25) than T19 (0) and TF (0) in 1986 and remained significantly higher (P <
  0.001) during the 4-year study. Both lead exposure and the probability of lead
  poisoning mortality in P8 were significantly higher (P < 0.001) in the fall of
  1986 (43%.8%; 0.25), before hunting season, than in the spring of 1987 (21.6%;
  0.04), after hunting season. We found no significant differences in the rates
  of lead exposure or lead poisoning mortality between male and female sentinel
  mallards. The results of this study demonstrate that in some locations, lead
  exposure and lead poisoning in waterfowl will continue to occur despite the
  conversion to steel shot for waterfowl hunting.

AB: To monitor genotoxicity in small bodies of water (e.g., creeks, ponds, and
  drainage ditches) we examined tadpole erythrocytes of two species: Rana
  clamitans and Rana pipiens, using the alkaline single cell gel DNA
  electrophoresis (SCG) or "comet" assay. This approach involves detection, under
  alkaline conditions, of cell DNA fragments which on electrophoresis migrate
  from the nuclear core, resulting in a "comet with tail" formation. Fifty-six
  samples, a total of 606 tadpoles, from 18 sites in southern Ontario, collected
  between 1993 and 1995, were examined. Samples of R. clamitans tadpoles
  collected in 1994 and 1995, from regions with heavy agricultural activity, gave
  significantly higher (P < 0.001) DNA length to width ratios than samples of R.
  clamitans tadpoles collected from sites in the Bruce Peninsula and near the
  French River, which have little or no agriculture. Samples of R. pipiens
  tadpoles collected in 1994 from sites on the outskirts of Windsor, Ontario,
  sites which receive genotoxic inputs from nearby industries, gave significantly
  higher (P < 0.001) DNA ratios than samples from agricultural areas and the
  Bruce Peninsula. R. clamitans tadpoles showed significant annual variation in
  DNA damage which was greater in samples of tadpoles collected from agricultural
  areas than from the Bruce Peninsula. The higher levels of DNA damage in
  tadpoles collected from agricultural areas may be due to the pesticides used,
  and the increased variation in DNA damage in the same areas is likely due to
  the impact of crop rotation, including leaving fields fallow, the timing of
  rainfall, and/or the application of pesticides. R. clamitans tadpoles,
  especially those collected from agricultural areas, also showed significant
  seasonal variation in DNA damage. There was no significant (P > 0.05) seasonal
  or annual variation in the levels of DNA damage in R. pipiens tadpoles
  collected from the Tallgrass Prairie. This study indicates that both species
  are suitable for use in the alkaline SCG assay and as in situ sentinel
  organisms for environmental biomonitoring.

AB: Tributyltin (TBT) and its degradation products, mono- (MBT) and dibutyltin
  (DBT) as well as triphenyltin (TPT) were determined in molluscs and fish
  collected along the Catalan coast (western Mediterranean). Marine molluscs
  (mussels, clams and snails) were sampled from three harbors with different
  characteristics (small vs. large boats). Two fish species were studied (a) the
  grey mullet Liza aurata sampled in Barcelona harbor and (b) the red mullet
  Mullus barbatus sampled along the coast; different tissues (muscle, liver,
  gills and digestive tube) were analyzed separately. The composition of butyltin
  compounds was different according to the organism and sampling point, but in
  general elevated concentrations of TBT were noticed in molluscs. The highest
  organotin residue levels (5.4 mu g/g d.w. as Sn) were detected in mussels from
  Masnou, a recreational marina, followed by those collected in Barcelona harbor
  (1.2 mu g/g d.w. as Sn). In contrast, no organotin compounds were detected in
  fish muscle and very low levels in the other organs, being TPT the major
  organotin in red mullet liver.

  Cryptosporidium-; Escherichia-coli; surface-contamination; groundwater-pollution
AB: Recent outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis and reports of other newly described
  para-sitic diseases associated with drinking water transmission prompted a
  reevaluation of source water monitoring criteria for public health protection.
  The field of microbial indicators was reviewed and each candidate sentinel
  evaluated in terms of its sensitivity, specificity, and technical feasibility.
  In addition, a clear distinction was made between source water monitoring and
  monitoring in the distribution system. Of all potential candidate microbial
  sentinels, Escherichia coli is deemed the most efficacious for public health
  protection. Based on a conservative estimate of its half-life in groundwater
  for 8 d, it is recommended that at least two samples be obtained during this
  half-life. In addition to E. coli, two water quality indicator sentinels, which
  are not necessarily direct public health threats, should also be monitored at
  the same frequency. These are the total coliform group and the enterococci. If
  E. coli is present in any source water sample, the borehole and any directly
  connected borehole should be embargoed. If either total coliforms or
  enterococci are detected, only that individual borehole should be taken off
  line and not used until the situation is remediated and the cause of the fecal
  contamination eliminated. Clostridium perfringens spores serve as a useful long
  -lived indicator. However, their perseverance in a sample should not be
  considered a direct public health threat because spores may far outlive
  pathogens. As a parasite indicator, C. perfringens should have the same
  importance as a positive coliform or enterococcus analysis. Coliphages do not
  yet fulfill enough of the criteria to be routinely employed. Biological
  monitoring should be coupled with physicochemical monitoring to establish a
  long-term history of the source. Because all natural waters vary in the amounts
  of heterotrophic plate count bacteria, test methods should be employed that are
  refractory to them. A combination of rigorous source protection plus
  extraordinary source monitoring serve as sufficient multiple barriers for
  parasite protection.

AB: Pollution of aquatic ecosystems poses a serious threat to aquatic organisms
  and ultimately the entire ecosystem. Understanding how a toxin affects
  embryonic development is key to determining the risk a pollutant represents to
  the environment. Extraembryonic membranes, such as the chorion of fish eggs,
  provide a protective barrier between the embryo and the environment. Although
  the fish chorion excludes many chemical pollutants, some noxious agents can
  still gain access to the aquatic embryo. Therefore a monitoring system that
  tests the effects directly upon the embryo must be established. Although
  exposure to a single toxin in the laboratory can determine the concentration at
  which a pollutant becomes a health or environmental hazard, embryos and adults
  in nature are not merely affected by a single chemical, but are exposed to
  mixtures of different pollutants. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) and medaka (Oryzias
  latipes) embryos were employed for the rapid observation of the effects of
  single chemicals and chemical mixtures on development. Using dechorionation and
  a perivitelline space microinjection system, the embryos were effective
  sentinels for low concentrations of aquatic pollutants. The developmental
  effects of small quantities of toxins were observed. Embryos treated during the
  late gastrula stage of development with hexachlorobenzene (HCB); 2,3,7,8
  -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD); toluene; benzene; or mixtures of these
  chemicals developed cardiovascular abnormalities. The zebrafish dechorionation
  exposure technique, Micro Intrachorionic Zebrafish Embryo Live Laboratory test,
  was especially effective in testing the pollutant mixtures. Combinations of
  both TCDD and benzene (as well as the toluene and benzene combinations) were
  tested and the mixtures acted synergistically; the combinations were more toxic
  than either chemical by itself. Hexachlorobenzene- and TCDD-treated embryos
  tested positively for expression of cytochrome P450 1A indicating that the
  cytochrome metabolic pathways were already functional in these early embryos,
  and suggested that a product of the cytochrome system may be involved in HCB
  and TCDD pollution associated cardiovascular defects.

AB: Accumulation and tissue distribution of Cu and Zn in target organs of
  Littorina littorea have been investigated. Weight changes in particular organs
  were associated with either Cu or Zn exposures and therefore, metal/shell
  -weight indices were used instead of metal concentrations to investigate metal
  accumulation and mobilisation. A regulatory mechanism was observed on exposure
  to low levels of Cu, but regulation did not occur between 8 and 80 mu g Cu/l
  seawater. Conversely, Zn was well-regulated up to a concentration of 80 mu g
  Zn/l seawater. Zn/Cu index increased linearly at increasing Zn exposure levels
  and decreased linearly at increasing Cu exposure levels. The gills are not
  target tissues reflecting environmental levels of either Cu or Zn, however,
  copper levels were elevated in gills after exposure to 80 mu g Cu/l seawater
  for 29 and 41 days. On the other hand, the highest concentration of Cu in the
  kidney was found after exposure to 8 mu g Cu/l seawater for 41 days. Higher
  exposures resulted in lower Cu concentrations. According to metal/shell-weight
  indices, Cu and Zn were not significantly accumulated in the digestive
  gland/gonad complex (DGGC) until a certain threshold value was reached
  (exposure level > 400 mu g day/l). On the other hand, DGGC weight was
  significantly reduced and, concomitantly, Zn and Cu concentrations raised.
  However, the metal concentration values increased beyond those resulting simply
  from a weight reduction. In conclusion, dissimilar mechanisms performed by
  different cell types in the different organs, together with metal-induced
  weight changes, would account for the existence of different patterns of metal
  accumulation and tissue distribution. It is therefore suggested that the
  suitability of winkles as indicators of Cu and Zn pollution should be
  reconsidered on the basis of measurements of metal burdens at tissue and cell
  levels.

AB: The tissue distribution of Zn in mussels collected from a Zn-polluted site
  and the changes in the pattern of distribution for Zn and Cu in response to
  experimental exposures to Cu, Zn and Cd, as well as the tissue distribution of
  Cd have been studied. The organs of mussels were accurately separated avoiding
  mixtures except the kidney area that was included within the remainder tissues.
  Mussels exposed to intermediate dose (ID)-Cd showed the highest Cd burden first
  in gills and then more or less equally distributed between the various tissues
  examined with a dominance of the digestive gland. Mussels exposed to high dose
  (HD)-Cd, showed Cd equally distributed through all the organs at both exposure
  times. Below 0.8 mu g Cd/l seawater, the gills of Zn-polluted mussels were able
  to either protect against Cd entry or mobilise uptaken Cd towards other
  tissues. On the other hand, Zn- and Cu-burdens did not rise in gill tissue,
  although in depurating mussels Zn-levels were higher than in any other exposure
  group. Similar conclusions were obtained for the digestive gland. However, the
  accumulative capacity of the digestive gland tissue for Cd was not exhausted
  and Cu burdens were depressed on exposure to Cd. Interactions between metals in
  the various organs studied could be explained by redistribution of haemocytes
  or brown cells and by enhanced release of metal-bearing digestive lysosomes in
  response to metal exposure. It is suggested that (a) the pattern of metal
  accumulation and tissue distribution as well as a part of the interactions
  between Cu, Zn and Cd cannot be explained solely by the availability of
  metallothioneins in specific organs; and (b) the specific cell type in which
  these ligands occur as well as the relative abundance and distribution of these
  cells are relevant factors controlling metal burdens in organs of mussels.
  Therefore, in addition to the chemical and the biochemical approaches,
  investigations on tissue sections are required to better understand these
  phenomena. Meanwhile, the digestive gland of mussels could be used as the
  target organ to monitor metal pollution, including essential and non-essential
  metals, on the basis of metal/shell-weight indices.

AB: The Northwest Territories (NWT) portion of the Slave River is downstream of
  the Athabasca and Peace Rivers and the potential for contamination from
  industrial and agricultural processes from these sources and from long-range
  transport is very real. In response to this threat, the Slave River
  Environmental Quality Monitoring Program was established cooperatively between
  the government of the Northwest Territories and federal government agencies in
  1991. A 5-year program was conducted to examine the quality of the water,
  suspended sediment, and fish in the territorial portion of the Slave River and
  to establish a baseline data set for comparison purposes in future monitoring
  programs. Additional facets of the study on the Slave River included an
  assessment of the benthic invertebrate population, since it was recognized that
  such a survey could be important for biomonitoring purposes. Abundance of
  organisms, taxon diversity, and presence or absence of sentinel species could
  all be used to assess environmental contamination. The final focus of the
  program was the examination of stable isotope ratios of carbon, sulphur, and
  nitrogen in the Slave River fish. Ecologically, these measurements can be used
  to determine the feeding and migration pattern of fish, and to define their
  trophic position in the food chain. From a toxicological point of view, these
  stable isotope ratios can help explain contaminant sources and transfer through
  the food chain. The benthic invertebrate survey was conducted in 1990 and 1991.
  The study concluded that the abundance of benthic invertebrates at the numerous
  sites examined in the Slave River was very low and organisms that had been used
  in other biomonitoring studies (e.g. bivalve molluscs, large oligochaetes) were
  rare or absent. Over 90% of the invertebrates collected from the Slave River
  were chironomids or small oligochaetes and comparisons of benthic invertebrate
  communities in the Slave River Delta indicated that few changes in percent
  composition or diversity had occurred over a 10-year period. The benthic
  invertebrate survey provided a baseline for future population analysis.
  Analysis of the stable isotope ratio of sulphur in fish from the Slave River
  indicated at least two significant food sources. One source is probably from
  Great Slave Lake, while the other is probably upstream of Fort Smith (Athabasca
  and Peace Rivers). Also, the stable isotope of carbon indicated that the food
  source is via different pathways and may include benthic as well as pelagic
  origins. It is difficult to make any conclusions regarding the organic
  concentrations found in fish tissues and their possible significance to isotope
  analysis, since the overall contaminant body burdens were generally very low or
  below analytical detection.

AB: Background: The regional poison information center is a potential sentinel
  for substance abuse patterns. Its central data collection system allows it to
  access information from large population groups. We report results from a one
  year prospective cases series of inhalation abuse from two regional poison
  information centers. Design: Prospective case series. All inhalation exposures
  reported to two regional poison information centers with a reason of
  intentional abuse were included. Results: One hundred sixty-five cases were
  collected. One hundred twenty-four exposures (75%) were male. Age ranged from 4
  to 45 y, with a mean, median and mode of 16.6 (SD 7.3), 15 and 13,
  respectively. Nine children were <6 years old. There were 22 substances
  involved, but two substances (spray paint and gasoline) accounted for more than
  61% of all cases. In children <9 y (n=18, 11%) gasoline alone accounted for 83%
  of exposures. Abuse occurred statewide, in both urban and rural settings, but
  tended to occur more often in rural environments (75%). Abuse was reported
  throughout the day with a peak incidence at 8 pm. One hundred twenty-three
  patients received direct medical evaluation or care. There was one fatality in
  this series and 15 patients were described as having life threatening symptoms.
  Conclusions: Inhalation abuse may begin very early in childhood and abuse
  appears to peak in adolescence. The regional poison information center can act
  as a sentinel for abuse patterns. This information can assist health care
  providers in poison and abuse prevention efforts.

AB: Western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE) and St. Louis encephalitis (SLE)
  viruses were detected in the Imperial Valley during the summers of 1991-1994 by
  isolation from the primary vector, Culex tarsalis Coquillett, and by the
  seroconversion of sentinel chickens. Enzootic transmission consistently was not
  detected first each year at sampling sites near specific landscape features
  such as a heron rookery and other riparian habitats along the New River, sites
  along the Mexican border, or saline and freshwater marshes along the southern
  shore of the Salton Sea. Despite mild winter temperatures and the elevated
  vernal abundance of Cx. tarsalis, WEE and SLE activity was not detected until
  June or July, indicating considerable amplification may be necessary before
  detection by testing mosquito pools for virus infection or sentinel chicken
  sera for antibodies. Results did not permit the spatial focusing of early
  season control efforts or research on mechanisms of virus interseasonal
  persistence.

AB: The scallop Adamussium colbecki can be profitably used for monitoring
  Antarctic coastal environments but its utility would be increased if chemical
  analyses of pollutants were integrated with data on their biological effects.
  Since oxidative stress is a common pathway of toxicity induced by xenobiotics,
  a preliminary biochemical characterization was carried out on the antioxidant
  system of this species and baseline data collected for future assessment of the
  anthropogenic impact in this remote area. The digestive gland and gills were
  investigated for levels of glutathione and the activity of several glutathione
  -dependent and antioxidant enzymes: gluthathione reductase, EC 1.6.4.2;
  glyoxalase I, EC 4.4.1.5; glyoxalase II, EC 3.1.2.6; gluthathione S
  -transferases, EC 2.5.1.18; Se-dependent, EC 1.11.1.9 and Se-independent, EC
  2.5.1.18 glutathione peroxidases; catalase, EC 1.11.1.6; and superoxide
  dismutase, EC 1.15.1.1. The same enzymatic activities were measured for
  comparison in the Mediterranean molluscs Mytilus galloprovincialis and Pecten
  jacobaeus. Very high levels of glutathione S-transferases were found in the
  digestive gland of both species of scallop compared to mussels, suggesting the
  importance of different feeding behaviour among these molluscs. However,
  catalase activity, much higher in Adamussium colbecki than in the Mediterranean
  molluscs, may represent a biochemical adaptation to the marine environment with
  high levels of dissolved oxygen. Enzymes from the Antarctic species appeared to
  be generally more active at low temperatures but, with few exceptions, their
  activities increased at higher temperatures.

AB: Due to the use of a limited number of species and subchronic exposures,
  current ecological hazard assessment processes can underestimate the chronic
  toxicity of environmental contaminants resulting in adverse responses of
  sentinel species. Several incidences where sentinel species have responded to
  the effects of chronic exposure to ambient levels of environmental contaminants
  are discussed, including the development of neoplasia in fish,
  immunosuppression in marine mammals, pseudohermaphrodism in invertebrates,
  teratogenicity in amphibians, and aberrations in the sexual development of fish
  and reptiles. Biomarkers of chronic toxicity, including DNA mutations,
  alterations in specific protein and mRNA levels, and perturbations in
  metabolism, are presented. The incorporation of appropriate surrogate species
  and biomarkers of chronic toxicity into standard toxicity characterizations is
  proposed as a means of significantly refining the ecological hazard assessment
  process.

AB: The correlation between environmental pollution and human health is one of
  the most important topics in public health. Environmentally-induced diseases
  generally show multifactorial etiology and their occurrence is dose-related;
  they can be included among the emergent diseases also in veterinary medicine.
  The epidemiological study of naturally occurring environmental diseases in
  animals, regarded as sentinel health events, can provide valuable information
  on agents being studied in human environmental epidemiological research. The
  epidemiologic aspects of naturally occurring diseases of domestic animals have
  so far received inadequate attention. Surveys have usually consisted of
  descriptive pathologic reports or of simple listings of case. There has been
  little or no attempt to relate the number of cases to the underlying
  population, thus there is little information on the prevalence rates of various
  animal diseases compiled according to age, breed, sex or environment. This
  paper reviews epidemiological studies of pet animals with spontaneously
  occurring respiratory diseases and attempts to determine the value of the
  animal in general and the dog in particular as a comparative model for
  environmental health.

AB: In December 1995, ambient radon levels exceeding 10,000 Bq/m3 were measured
  in a basement shelter workroom of a multilevel East Talpiot, Jerusalem, public
  elementary school (six grades, 600 students). The measurements were taken after
  cancers (breast and multiple myeloma) were diagnosed in two workers who spent
  their workdays in basement rooms. The school was located on a hill that
  geologic maps show to be rich in phosphate deposits, which are a recognized
  source for radon gas and its daughter products. Levels exceeding 1000,000 Bq/m3
  were measured at the mouth of a pipe in the basement shelter workroom, the
  major point of radon entry. The school was closed and charcoal and electret ion
  chamber detectors were used to carry out repeated 5-day measurements in all
  rooms in the multilevel building over a period of several months. Radon
  concentrations were generally higher in rooms in the four levels of the
  building that were below ground level. There were some ground-level rooms in
  the building in which levels reached up to 1300 Bq/m3. In rooms above ground
  level, however, peak levels did not exceed 300 Bq/m3. Exposure control based on
  sealing and positive pressure ventilation was inadequate. These findings
  suggested that radon diffused from highly contaminated basement and ground
  -floor rooms to other areas of the building and that sealing off the source may
  have led to reaccumulation of radon beneath the building. Later, subslab
  venting of below-ground radon pockets to the outside air was followed by more
  sustained reductions in indoor radon levels to levels below 75 Bq/m3. Even so,
  radon accumulated in certain rooms when the building was closed. This sentinel
  episode called attention to the need for a national radon policy requiring
  threshold exposure levels for response and control. A uniform nationwide
  standard for school buildings below 75 Bq/m3 level was suggested after
  considering prudent avoidance, the controversies over risk assessment of
  prolonged low-level exposures in children, and the fact that exposures in most
  locations in the Talpiot school could be reduced below this level. Proposal of
  this stringent standard stimulated the search for a strategy of risk control
  and management based on control at the source. This strategy was more effective
  and probably more cost effective than one based on suppression of exposure
  based on sealing and ventilation. Because many Israeli areas and much of the
  West Bank area of the Palestinian National Authority sit on the same phosphate
  deposits, regional joint projects for surveillance and control may be indicated.

AB: To improve safety and health in the workplace, appropriate occupational
  health programs should be implemented utilizing expertise from multiple
  disciplines. In other words, the occupational health program should be a team
  effort. Expertise from all aspects of occupational health should be utilized,
  from the industrial hygienist, to the safety officer, to the occupational
  health nurse, and the practicing physician--all should be involved in the
  program to maintain a safe and healthy workplace. Two NIOSH resources have been
  described to assist the occupational health professional in the improvement of
  safety and health in the workplace. First, the SHEO approach, where a separate
  SHEO list is to be developed for each workplace. This may be a problem when the
  physician is an outside contractor, but with the help of the team approach, a
  list of SHEOs can be developed. Second, medical screening and biological
  monitoring is often required. While we realize that medical screening and
  biological monitoring is part of the complete occupational health program, the
  table of medical tests that we have prepared may give some leads into the
  type(s) of medical tests to be conducted on the individual worker at a
  particular worksite.

AB: More than 4,000 persons with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)
  infection have been identified in Vietnam through sentinel surveillance since
  1990, when the first case of HIV-1 infection was diagnosed in a young woman in
  Ho Chi Minh City. Currently, the estimated HIV-1 seroprevalences of 10% for
  injection drug users (IDU) and 3% for female commercial sex workers (CSW) in
  Vietnam are comparable to those observed in the same risk groups in Thailand
  five years ago. To clarify if concurrent epidemics with different HIV-1
  subtypes (or clades) are occurring among different high-risk behavior groups in
  Vietnam, we conducted a genotypic analysis of HIV-1 by amplifying and
  sequencing a 325-nucleotide region spanning the principal neutralizing domain,
  or V3 loop, of the gp120-encoding env gene from genomic DNA extracted from
  dried, filter paper-blotted blood samples, collected in April/May and
  August/September 1995 from 8 HIV-1-seropositive CSW in Ho Chi Minh City, Can
  Tho and An Giang provinces and from 16 IDU in Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, Nha
  Trang and An Giang province. Sequence alignment and comparison with other HIV-1
  subtypes indicated that the HIV-1 strains from CSW and IDU in Vietnam were
  genetically most similar to subtype E strains from Cambodia. The interstrain
  genetic variation among the Vietnam HIV-1 env sequences ranged from 0.3% to
  9.0% (mean, 4.6%). Phylogenetic analysis verified that some of the Vietnam HIV
  -1 strains formed discrete clusters and were indistinguishable from other
  Southeast Asian strains. The demonstration of subtype E in both CSW and IDU in
  Vietnam contrasts sharply with the previously observed HIV-1 clade restriction
  in these high-risk behavior groups in nearby Thailand.

AB: Female guinea pigs (12/group) were given a single dose of [14C]olestra by
  gavage after consuming either 3% poligeenan in tap water (Compromised group) or
  just tap water (Normal group) for 5 weeks. A Sentinel group (N = 2) was given
  3% poligeenan for 5 weeks. Ten sentinel animals were killed 1 day before and 10
  1 day after the other animals were dosed with [14C]olestra and their
  gastrointestinal tracts were examined by histology. The Compromised and Normal
  animals were endoscoped just before dosing with [14C]olestra. Urine and feces
  were collected continuously and CO2 was collected for 7 days after dosing. The
  samples were analyzed for 14C and urine was also analyzed for [14C]sucrose.
  Animals (3/group) were killed 1, 3, 7, and 21 days after dosing, and tissues
  were collected and assayed for 14C. Tissue lipids were extracted, fractionated
  by high-pressure liquid chromatography, and analyzed for [14C]olestra by liquid
  scintillation. Animals fed poligeenan showed mucosal edema, congestion,
  ulceration, and fibrin deposition within the distal colon and rectum. Histology
  revealed inflammation, epithelial degeneration, and multifocal ulceration of
  the cecum, distal colon, and rectum. The gastrointestinal mucosae of
  nonpoligeenan fed animals were normal. No [14C]olestra was detected in liver
  lipids and no [14C]sucrose was found in the urine for any animal in the Normal
  or Compromised groups, indicating that intact olestra was not absorbed. The
  amount, distribution, and elimination of absorbed 14C did not differ between
  guinea pigs with normal and compromised gastrointestinal tracts. The poligeenan
  -treated animals displayed mucosal damage similar to that seen in human
  inflammatory bowel diseases; therefore, these results suggest that patients
  with inflammatory bowel conditions will not absorb olestra to any greater
  extent than normal healthy people.

AB: The incidence of malignant melanoma continues to rise steadily in the United
  States, with approximately 40,300 new cases expected in 1997. A significant
  number of patients with deep primary lesions or regional lymph node metastases
  are at high risk for developing recurrent, metastatic disease despite adequate
  surgical intervention. Therefore, approaches to adjuvant therapy including
  immunotherapy, such as interferon, levamisole, and vaccines and chemotherapy
  and chemoimmunotherapy have been investigated in high-risk patients. The key
  adjuvant trials are reviewed, with emphasis placed on randomized trials. High
  -dose interferon-alpha has recently been shown to modestly improve disease-free
  and overall survival in a prospective randomized trial of high-risk patients
  and has been approved by the FDA for this indication. Vaccines, which currently
  remain experimental, may prove to be equally effective but less toxic options
  for adjuvant therapy. Also, the identification of more high-risk patients who
  might benefit from adjuvant therapy may be facilitated by sentinel lymph node
  biopsy and the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for tyrosinase.

  public health authorities about the nature and magnitude of foodborne illnesses
  and their epidemiology, for the early detection of foodborne disease outbreaks,
  and for the planning, implementation and evaluation of food safety programmes.
  Thus, epidemiological surveillance of foodborne diseases is fundamental to any
  food safety programme. Various methods of foodborne surveillance may be
  utilized: (i) records for registration of deaths and hospital discharges; (ii)
  disease notification, (iii) sentinel surveillance, (iv) laboratory
  surveillance, (v) outbreak investigation and (vi) epidemiological research.
  This article reviews each method, its advantages and disadvantages, and its
  relevance for meeting the various objectives and needs.

AB: BACKGROUND: The sentinel lymph node is the first node or nodes to drain a
  cutaneous melanoma. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is performed to determine
  whether regional metastases are present. The authors' experience with the new
  technique of sentinel lymph node biopsy for melanoma of the head and neck is
  reported. PATIENTS AND METHODS: During the period of January of 1992 to
  December of 1995, 58 consecutive patients were identified from the melanoma
  database who had localization of the sentinel lymph node for primary cutaneous
  melanoma of the head and neck. Techniques for identification of the sentinel
  node(s) include preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and intraoperative Lymphazurin
  dye (vital blue dye) and technetium-99m-labeled sulfur colloid injection around
  the primary tumor site with Neoprobe mapping. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients (13
  female, 45 male), mean age 61 years, with melanoma of the head and neck with a
  mean Breslow thickness of 2.21 mm. (range, 0.82-6.87 mm.) and no regional
  lymphadenopathy underwent sentinel node mapping. The sentinel node was
  successfully identified in 55 patients (95 percent). Blue dye was visualized in
  85 of 126 sentinel nodes excised (67 percent), whereas the remainder of the
  sentinel nodes were localized with the Neoprobe. Forty-nine patients who had
  successful mapping and sentinel node biopsy had no evidence of metastatic
  disease in the sentinel node or other nodes in the basin. Six of the fifty-five
  patients (11 percent) had evidence of micrometastatic disease, and all six had
  the sentinel node as the only site of metastasis. Five of six patients with
  micrometastases had a subsequent neck dissection and/or superficial
  parotidectomy. None of these patients had evidence of "skip metastases" with a
  negative sentinel node and higher level nodes positive for metastases. In
  total, 6 of the 18 sentinel nodes (33 percent) identified in these six patients
  contained micrometastatic disease, whereas none of the 139 other nodes sampled
  had any evidence of metastases. The exact probability that all six unpaired
  observations would consist of involvement of only the sentinel nodes is p =
  0.0312. CONCLUSIONS: By combining the two mapping techniques in patients with
  melanoma of the head and neck, the sentinel node(s) can be mapped and
  identified individually, similar to melanoma in other locations. The sentinel
  nodes have been shown to contain the first evidence of regional metastatic
  melanoma. This staging information can be used to plan therapeutic node
  dissections and adjuvant therapy that may have a survival benefit in patients
  with stage III melanoma of the head and neck. Lymphatic mapping can be used to
  make the surgical care of the melanoma patient more conservative, so that only
  those patients with solid evidence of regional node metastases are subjected to
  the morbidity and expense of a complete node dissection and the toxicities of
  adjuvant therapy.

AB: The objective of this work was to determine whether the prevalence of
  respiratory symptoms differed among workers exposed to different types of metal
  -working fluids. As part of a mandatory surveillance system for occupational
  illness, from 1988-1994, the Michigan Department of Public Health received, 86
  occupational disease reports of work-related asthma secondary to exposure to
  metal-working fluids. As part of a public health program, follow-up industrial
  hygiene inspections, including medical interviews of the workforce, were
  performed at companies where the reported cases had become ill. Metal-working
  fluids were the second most common cause of work-related asthma reported in the
  state. Most of the reports were from the automobile industry. Follow-up
  inspections were conducted at 37 facilities where the individuals with work
  -related asthma had worked. Seven hundred and fifty-five workers at these
  facilities were interviewed. Only one facility was above the allowable oil mist
  standard. Despite the exposure levels being within the legal limits,
  approximately 20% of the fellow workers of the reported cases had daily or
  weekly respiratory symptoms suggestive of work-related asthma. Workers exposed
  to emulsified, semisynthetic, or synthetic machining coolants were more likely
  to have chronic bronchitis; to have visited a doctor for shortness of breath;
  to have visited a doctor for a sinus problem; to be bothered at work by nasal
  stuffiness, runny nose, or sore throat; and to have an increased prevalence of
  respiratory symptoms consistent with work-related asthma, compared to workers
  exposed to mineral oil metal-working fluids. These findings were found in
  individuals who currently smoked, had never smoked or were ex-cigarette
  smokers. Further research to determine the chemical components or microbial
  contaminants responsible for these findings is needed.

AB: Polychaetes, because of their bioturbation capacity, play an important role
  in the distribution of anthropogenic contaminants (including polycyclic
  aromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs]) throughout the sediments. In this work the use of
  Nereis virens (Annelida: Polychaeta) as a bioindicator to assess the genotoxic
  risk of PAH exposure for the environment was evaluated. For this purpose the
  alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis [comet] assay was applied on the
  coelomocytes of in vivo exposed Nereis virens. Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) was
  chosen because it is classified by the IARC (International Agency for Research
  on Cancer) as "probably carcinogenic to humans" and because its mechanisms of
  action are well-known. Nereis virens was exposed to B[a]P in concentrations of
  0.3, 0.6, 10, 20, 35 and 45 mg/ml by an intracoelomic injection of B[a]P (20
  microliters) dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO). A solvent control with
  DMSO, a positive control with ethyl methane sulphonate (EMS) (12.1 mg/ml) and a
  negative control were included in each experiment. For each treatment four
  animals were analysed. After 1 hr treatment coelomocytes were harvested by
  puncturing the coelomic cavity with a sharpened Pasteur pipette, mixed with
  0.5% low melting point agarose and sandwiched between two other gel layers.
  Ethidium bromide stained nuclei were analysed for tail length and tail moment.
  12.1 mg/ml EMS, pure DMSO (98.9%) and B[a]P in all tested concentrations
  induced a statistically significant increase of DNA single strand breaks in the
  comet assay. The effect of B[a]P, however, was only at the highest
  concentration (45 mg/ml) significantly stronger than the effect of DMSO alone.
  Although a relatively large heterogeneity in the results could be observed,
  these experiments clearly showed that Nereis virens is not suited as a sentinel
  species for the assessment of the genotoxic risk of PAH exposure because this
  species seems to be very resistant to benzo[a]pyrene.

AB: Recent outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis and reports of other newly described
  para-sitic diseases associated with drinking water transmission prompted a
  reevaluation of source water monitoring criteria for public health protection.
  The field of microbial indicators was reviewed and each candidate sentinel
  evaluated in terms of its sensitivity, specificity, and technical feasibility.
  In addition, a clear distinction was made between source water monitoring and
  monitoring in the distribution system. Of all potential candidate microbial
  sentinels, Escherichia coli is deemed the most efficacious for public health
  protection. Based on a conservative estimate of its half-life in groundwater
  for 8 d, it is recommended that at least two samples be obtained during this
  half-life. In addition to E. coli, two water quality indicator sentinels, which
  are not necessarily direct public health threats, should also be monitored at
  the same frequency. These are the total coliform group and the enterococci. If
  E. coli is present in any source water sample, the borehole and any directly
  connected borehole should be embargoed. If either total coliforms or
  enterococci are detected, only that individual borehole should be taken off
  line and not used until the situation is remediated and the cause of the fecal
  contamination eliminated. Clostridium perfringens spores serve as a useful long
  -lived indicator. However, their perseverance in a sample should not be
  considered a direct public health threat because spores may far outlive
  pathogens. As a parasite indicator, C. perfringens should have the same
  importance as a positive coliform or enterococcus analysis. Coliphages do not
  yet fulfill enough of the criteria to be routinely employed. Biological
  monitoring should be coupled with physicochemical monitoring to establish a
  long-term history of the source. Because all natural waters vary in the amounts
  of heterotrophic plate count bacteria, test methods should be employed that are
  refractory to them. A combination of rigorous source protection plus
  extraordinary source monitoring serve as sufficient multiple barriers for
  parasite protection.

AB: Pollution of aquatic ecosystems poses a serious threat to aquatic organisms
  and ultimately the entire ecosystem. Understanding how a toxin affects
  embryonic development is key to determining the risk a pollutant represents to
  the environment. Extraembryonic membranes, such as the chorion of fish eggs,
  provide a protective barrier between the embryo and the environment. Although
  the fish chorion excludes many chemical pollutants, some noxious agents can
  still gain access to the aquatic embryo. Therefore a monitoring system that
  tests the effects directly upon the embryo must be established. Although
  exposure to a single toxin in the laboratory can determine the concentration at
  which a pollutant becomes a health or environmental hazard, embryos and adults
  in nature are not merely affected by a single chemical, but are exposed to
  mixtures of different pollutants. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) and medaka (Oryzias
  latipes) embryos were employed for the rapid observation of the effects of
  single chemicals and chemical mixtures on development. Using dechorionation and
  a perivitelline space microinjection system, the embryos were effective
  sentinels for low concentrations of aquatic pollutants. The developmental
  effects of small quantities of toxins were observed. Embryos treated during the
  late gastrula stage of development with hexachlorobenzene (HCB); 2,3,7,8
  -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD); toluene; benzene; or mixtures of these
  chemicals developed cardiovascular abnormalities. The zebrafish dechorionation
  exposure technique, Micro Intrachorionic Zebrafish Embryo Live Laboratory test,
  was especially effective in testing the pollutant mixtures. Combinations of
  both TCDD and benzene (as well as the toluene and benzene combinations) were
  tested and the mixtures acted synergistically; the combinations were more toxic
  than either chemical by itself. Hexachlorobenzene- and TCDD-treated embryos
  tested positively for expression of cytochrome P450 1A indicating that the
  cytochrome metabolic pathways were already functional in these early embryos,
  and suggested that a product of the cytochrome system may be involved in HCB
  and TCDD pollution associated cardiovascular defects.

AB: Due to the use of a limited number of species and subchronic exposures,
  current ecological hazard assessment processes can underestimate the chronic
  toxicity of environmental contaminants resulting in adverse responses of
  sentinel species. Several incidences where sentinel species have responded to
  the effects of chronic exposure to ambient levels of environmental contaminants
  are discussed, including the development of neoplasia in fish,
  immunosuppression in marine mammals, pseudohermaphrodism in invertebrates,
  teratogenicity in amphibians, and aberrations in the sexual development of fish
  and reptiles. Biomarkers of chronic toxicity, including DNA mutations,
  alterations in specific protein and mRNA levels, and perturbations in
  metabolism, are presented. The incorporation of appropriate surrogate species
  and biomarkers of chronic toxicity into standard toxicity characterizations is
  proposed as a means of significantly refining the ecological hazard assessment
  process.

AB: BACKGROUND: The human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired
  immunodeficiency syndrome have had a dramatic effect on the practice of
  surgery. Critical issues include quantifying the risk encountered by surgeons
  when operating on infected patients, the benefits of chemoprophylaxis after
  injury by a health care worker, the likelihood of infected surgeons
  transmitting human immunodeficiency virus to patients, and the debate over
  mandatory testing. STUDY DESIGN: Literature review of English-language
  publications. RESULTS: The incidence of human immunodeficiency virus infection
  ranges from 1.3 percent of patients hospitalized at sentinel hospitals to
  1.5/1,000 patients in lower risk environments. The rate of percutaneous injury
  during an operation is 5 percent to 6 percent, and human immunodeficiency virus
  transmission after percutaneous injury with a needle contaminated with the
  human immunodeficiency virus is 0.3 percent. Here, we review current Public
  Health Service recommendations for chemoprophylaxis after percutaneous injury
  and address the debate over mandatory human immunodeficiency virus testing for
  patients and surgeons in the context of new information regarding the test for
  the human immunodeficiency virus. CONCLUSIONS: Controversial issues regarding
  acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and the human immunodeficiency virus
  infection must be addressed by all surgeons on the basis of objective
  information.

  educational programs for commercial and farm pesticide applicators and
  increasing enforcement of licensing examination requirements. This report was
  presented at the 1994 Interim Meeting of the AMA House of Delegates as Report 4
  of the Council on Scientific Affairs. METHODS: Information for the report was
  derived from published literature and from personal communications with state
  and federal regulatory officials, physicians, and representatives of pest
  control, lawn care, and farm organizations. Some information about state
  certification and training programs was obtained from telephone conversations
  with pesticide applicator training program coordinators from California,
  Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York,
  Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. These states were selected because they
  contain large agricultural or urban populations that are likely to require the
  services of trained professional pesticide applicators. RESULTS: Current
  surveillance systems are inadequate to characterize potential exposure problems
  related either to pesticide usage or to pesticide related illnesses. The
  effectiveness of applicator certification and training programs and public
  notification programs could not be determined because of a lack of federal and
  state survey data for making useful assessments. CONCLUSIONS: Considering
  current data gaps, it is prudent for homeowners, farmers, and workers to limit
  pesticide exposures to themselves and others.

AB: As health care provision in the United States shifts to primary care
  settings, it is vital that new models of occupational health services be
  developed that link clinical care to prevention. The model program described in
  this paper was developed at the Union Health Center (UHC), a comprehensive
  health care center supported by the International Ladies Garment Workers Union
  (now the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees) serving a
  population of approximately 50,000 primarily minority, female garment workers
  in New York City. The objective of this paper is to describe a model
  occupational medicine program in a union-based comprehensive health center
  linking accessible clinical care with primary and secondary disease prevention
  efforts. To assess the presence of symptoms suggestive of occupational disease,
  a health status questionnaire was administered to female workers attending the
  UHC for routine health maintenance. Based on the results of this survey, an
  occupational medicine clinic was developed that integrated direct clinical care
  with worker and employer education and workplace hazard abatement. To assess
  the success of this new approach, selected cases of sentinel health events were
  tracked and a chart review was conducted after 3 years of clinic operation.
  Prior to initiation of the occupational medicine clinic, 64% (648) of the
  workers surveyed reported symptoms indicative of occupational illnesses.
  However, only 42 (4%) reported having been told by a physician that they had an
  occupational illness and only 4 (.4%) reported having field a workers'
  compensation claim for an occupational disease. In the occupational medicine
  clinic established at the UHC, a health and safety specialist acts as a case
  manager, coordinating worker and employer education as well as workplace hazard
  abatement focused on disease prevention, ensuring that every case of
  occupational disease is treated as a potential sentinel health event. As
  examples of the success of this approach, index cases of rotator cuff
  tendonitis, lead poisoning, and formaldehyde overexposure in three patients and
  their preventative workplace follow-up, affecting approximately 150 workers at
  three worksites, are described. Work-related conditions diagnosed during the
  first 3 years of clinic operation included cumulative trauma disorders (141
  cases), carpal tunnel syndrome (47 cases), low back disorders (33 cases), lead
  poisoning (20 cases), and respiratory disease (9 cases). This pilot project
  represents a new model for effective integration of clinical care and
  occupational disease prevention efforts within a primary care center. It could
  serve as a prototype for development of such services in other managed and
  primary care settings.

AB: PROBLEM/CONDITION: Silicosis is an occupational respiratory disease caused
  by the inhalation of respirable dust containing crystalline silica. Public
  health surveillance programs to identify workers at risk for silicosis and
  target workplace-specific and other prevention efforts are currently being
  field-tested in seven U.S. states. REPORTING PERIOD COVERED: Confirmed cases
  ascertained by state health departments during the period January 1, 1993,
  through December 31, 1993; the cases and associated workplaces were followed
  through December 1994. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEMS: As part of the Sentinel Event
  Notification System for Occupational Risks (SENSOR) program initiated by CDC's
  National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), development of
  state-based surveillance and intervention programs for silicosis was initiated
  in 1987 in Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio, and Wisconsin and in 1992 in Illinois,
  North Carolina, and Texas. RESULTS: From January 1, 1993, through December 2,
  1994, the SENSOR silicosis programs in Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, North
  Carolina, Ohio, Texas, and Wisconsin confirmed 256 cases of silicosis that were
  initially ascertained in 1993. Overall, 185 (72%) were initially identified
  through review of hospital discharge data or through hospital reports of
  silicosis diagnoses; 188 (73%) were associated with silica exposure in
  manufacturing industries (e.g., foundries; stone, clay, glass, and concrete
  manufacturers; and industrial and commercial machinery manufacture). Overall,
  42 (16%) cases were associated with silica exposure from sandblasting
  operations. Among the 193 confirmed cases for which information was available
  about duration of employment in jobs with potential exposure to silica, 37
  (19%) were employed

  sealing of packages made from distinct structures, generally used to package
  snacks and ground coffees, were examined. A Sentinel 12-12AS heat sealer
  operating with both sealing bars heated was used with the 5 aluminium jaw
  profiles 10 mm wide and 300 mm long. Pillow packages of metallized laminates
  (BOPPmet/BOPPcoex for snacks and BOPPmet/LDPE for coffee) were sealed with 3
  seals under various conditions, to allow optimization of heat sealing
  conditions. Vibration tests and a transport simulation, and evaluations of the
  heat seal quality were performed. For the snack package, all the jaw profiles
  tested resulted in heat seals with integrity problems, the flat seal being
  worst. Heat seal quality was unaffected by the transport simulation. For 250-g
  coffee packages, all jaw profiles resulted in intact seals without wrinkles
  and/or capillaries, but flat, inclined and lengthwise profiles are not
  recommended on the basis of variation in heat seal strength on transport
  simulations.

AB: Results are presented of surveys of 34 sentinel sites in 18 counties in
  endemic waterborne fluorosis areas of China carried out in 1991 and 1992. At
  each site, water fluoride levels, urinary fluoride levels in children, dental
  fluorosis in children and skeletal fluorosis in adults were measured. Progress
  in improving water to control fluorosis was very slow. By the end of 1991, only
  42.1% of villages and 39.3% of the population in endemic fluorosis areas had
  improved water supplies. In 1992 this improvement increased by only 1%.
  Inspection of 987 water improvement projects to reduce fluoride showed that
  82.7% were continuously used, 10.3% had interrupted use, and 7.0% had been
  stopped or destroyed. 65.4% of projects resulted in water fluoride contents of
  <1.0 mg/l, 21.3% had 1.0-1.5 mg/l and 15.4% had >1.5 mg/l. Urinary fluoride
  contents and dental fluorosis indices of 8-12-yr-old children decreased yr by
  yr, especially in sites with longer standing water improvement projects and
  water fluoride contents of <1.0 mg/l. Symptoms and signs of adult fluorosis
  also decreased, but not as significantly as urinary fluoride content and dental
  fluorosis of children. [From En summ.]

  in soft tissues of blue mussels (Mytilus edulis). These sea foods were sampled
  from 8 locations along Hardangerfjord, Norway, up to 100 km from a source of
  pollution at the head of the fjord. Both relative and absolute amounts of the 6
  heavy metals differed between the 2 fish species, and between the 2 tissues.
  Mussels contained higher concn. of most elements than fish, and relative concn.
  of elements was very different between mussels and fish. Differences and
  similarities between samples from the 8 locations were assessed by principal
  component analysis, and correlations between concn. of individual heavy metals
  were calculated. In fish, a concn. gradient away from the source of pollution
  was found only for arsenic in saithe tissues and Hg in flounder liver. In
  mussels, the gradient was marginal for arsenic; significant gradients were
  found for other tissues. Concn. of Cd in mussels were not closely correlated
  with concn. of other minerals.

AB: Combining parasitological with histopathological data from the western
  mosquitofish inhabiting sites above, below, and in an integrated pulp and paper
  mill effluent canal along the Sulphur River in Texas and Arkansas demonstrates
  that the western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) serves as a good sentinel.
  Fish from the canal habitat receiving direct effluent as well as those
  downstream to the mill effluent canal were healthy in terms of species richness
  of parasites and of being free from pathogenic parasites known to be associated
  with stress. Histopathologic examination of mosquitofish specimens supported by
  additional tissues known to respond to toxicant challenge from large fish
  specimens collected at the same sites revealed no cancerous or other lesions or
  abnormalities that could be related to anthropogenic chemical toxicants. In
  fact, from the 4,324 slides of 816 fish examined, only one lesion was found
  that resembled a neoplastic lesion. That lesion, a "pre"-neoplastic one and one
  representing no more than background level, was in the liver of a freshwater
  drum from a tributary to the river. The most stressed site, based on low
  species richness of particular parasites, invasion into host tissues by a
  ciliate, a high prevalence of macrophage aggregates in the spleen, and high
  prevalence of vacuolated hepatocytes, occurred upstream from the effluent canal.

  behalf of Weyerhaeuser Canada Ltd. in 1991 and 1992. The target sample size for
  the two sentinel species was 20 per sex per sample area. There were no
  indications of significantly slower or faster growing walleye in the North
  Saskatchewan River. Exposure indicators such as EROD activity and
  organochlorine body burdens in North Saskatchewan walleye were in the range
  found in the reference river. Livers were not enlarged. North Saskatchewan
  River white suckers were younger on average and matured earlier than Cowan
  River white suckers. Condition factors were nearly identical between the two
  rivers. The rate of growth between sites was equal or only marginally higher in
  the North Saskatchewan River. The main differences were a higher mean EROD
  activity (although the ranges were similar in both rivers), younger fish,
  smaller GSIs (because the fish were younger and some partially spent) and a
  higher incidence of pale livers and parasites in the North Saskatchewan. There
  were no detectable levels of organochlorine compounds in white suckers from the
  North Saskatchewan River. There were no correlations between indicators of
  exposure to bleached kraft mill effluent and population-level parameters in
  either species. A greater range of age classes observed in the walleye
  population of the North Saskatchewan River may have been a consequence of a
  difference in exploitation rates in the two rivers. Very low river flows
  affected the success of the main sampling year (1992) and thus the ability to
  interpret data on reproductive potential of walleye. Comparison of 1991 and
  1992 data was difficult because of differences in spawning condition (pre
  -spawning versus spawning) in the two years. The cause of younger, faster
  maturing white suckers in the North Saskatchewan is not apparent, since the
  overall pattern observed is not "typical" of population responses observed in
  other studies. It appears that the usefulness of whole organism and population
  parameters as early indicators of stress from specific sources such as pulp
  mills depends on a strong understanding of the effects of other factors (e.g.,
  exploitation and river flows). In these large rivers, detecting incremental
  population-level effects from one particular stressor in the absence of a
  strong contaminant gradient seems unlikely.

AB: A bioassessment study was conducted on the transport, fate and effects of
  silver and other metals in Big Bayou Creek in Western Kentucky. Results of
  environmental chemistry, effluent and ambient toxicity studies and ecological
  surveys were integrated to assess the effects of metal pollution. The stream
  system was a second to third order tributary of the Ohio River; was of moderate
  gradient; and was characterized by good habitat quality and frequent riffles,
  runs and pools. Sediment characteristics generally were comparable throughout
  the study area. The creek received four continuous and four intermittent
  effluent outfalls from a uranium enrichment plant. The discharge volume of the
  continuous effluent totaled 3.96 million gallons per day (MGD) and, in
  downstream order, included approximately 0.44 MGD for 009, 1.18 for 008, 0.71
  for 006, and 1.63 for 001. The study area encompassed 10.7 stream km and
  included nine stream monitoring stations (BB1-BB9) and eight effluent
  monitoring points. Water column residence time for metals calculated from the
  effluent 009 outfall were 0.65 hr, 1.2 hr, and 2.31 hr for downstream stations
  BB7, BB8 and BB9, respectively. The principal reference station (BB1) was 1.4
  km upstream of the first effluent outfall (009). A nearby secondary reference
  station (BB2) also was located just upstream of effluent 009 and was used
  primarily for the collection of fish and macroinvertebrate taxa used for
  "sentinel monitoring" to characterize metal bioavailability. Ecological surveys
  included the collection of resident biota from all stream stations, including
  sites located downstream of each effluent. Ecological perturbation primarily
  affected macroinvertebrate populations. The latter were sampled in spring,
  summer, and fall of the first year of the study and annually thereafter for
  five years. Average results from the first two-years for total
  macroinvertebrate density and number of taxa are illustrated in Figure 1.
  Macroinvertebrate species richness and density were reduced perceptibly in the
  effluent receiving zone, amounting to losses of 33 and 77%, respectively.
  Abundance of mayfly taxa was reduced by more than 50% immediately below the 009
  outfall. Multimetrics based on U.S. EPA Protocol III (Plafkin et al., 1989),
  were used to calculate bioassessment (BA) scores, which indicated moderate to
  substantial impact for stations BB3-BB7. Toxicological characterization of
  effluents and receiving waters was performed using chronic biomonitoring
  procedures with Ceriodaphnia dubia and the fathead minnow, Pimephales promelas
  (Weber et al., 1989). Of approximately 300 on-site tests, 92 were conducted on
  the continuously flowing effluents that discharged into Big Bayou Creek.
  Significant toxicity was observed for effluent 008 50% of the time. Effluent
  004, which tested positive in 100% of tests conducted, originated from a
  secondary waste treatment plant and entered 008 just prior to its entry into
  Big Bayou Creek upstream of station BB4. As discussed below, metal uptake in
  resident biota was highest at this station.

AB: To investigate potential causal relationships between contaminant exposure
  and biological responses in fish, a suite of bioindicators ranging from the
  biochemical to the community-level were measured in fish populations and
  communities downstream from a bleached kraft mill effluent discharge.
  Downstream gradients in responses were evident in elevated hepatic mixed
  -function oxygenase activity, several measures of condition and bioenergetic
  status, growth, the health assessment index, and several fish community-level
  parameters. A multivariate discriminant analysis procedure, which included many
  of the individual bioindicators, also demonstrated a gradient in integrated
  health status of a sentinel fish species in the contaminated river. These
  downstream response gradients were probably influenced to a greater degree by
  contaminant discharges than by natural or anthropogenic nutrient sources
  downstream. Establishing causal relationships between a specific contaminant
  source and responses in sentinel aquatic organisms becomes relatively more
  straightforward when downstream gradients in biological responses are observed
  at multiple levels of biological organization.

AB: I propose a method to test extensions of models concerning the maintenance
  of cooperative breeding systems that examines patterns of habitat use relative
  to the distribution of habitat components among territories. I analyzed habitat
  use and behavioral time budget data for a Texas population of the Western Scrub
  -Jay (Aphelocoma californica). As a non-cooperative population, one of two
  habitat-use patterns was expected: (1) specialist habitat-use patterns in an
  abundant, widespread habitat type, with little variation among territories in
  habitat composition or (2) generalist habitat-use patterns with the potential
  of significant variation in habitat composition among territories. These jays
  show a combination of habitat-use patterns supporting both predictions. The
  only resources that males utilize as a specialist, tall oak trees during
  sentinel behavior, are fairly widespread and would not be considered a limiting
  resource. In the remaining habitat categories, Texas populations of Western
  Scrub-Jays act as generalists, using the habitat in relation to its
  availability, even though variation in habitat composition among territories is
  considerable. Variation among individuals within a sex was observed but could
  not be explained using various demographic and ecological correlates.
  Additional detailed habitat use data when used in a comparative framework can
  aid determination of subtle ecological differences among populations of Western
  Scrub-Jays and allow closer examination of intrinsic and extrinsic ecological
  models concerning the evolution and maintenance of cooperative breeding systems
  in this group.

  mechanisms against pathogens. For ten years, we studied the effects on rainbow
  trout and carp of pesticides such as organochlorine (lindane) and
  organophosphorous (trichlorfon, dichlorvos) insecticides, and a triazine
  herbicide (atrazine); heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Mg, Mn, Hg) were also analysed for
  their in vitro effects. More recently, pulp mill effluents were studied on
  rainbow trout immunity. Most of those aquatic pollutants were shown to be
  partial or total immunosuppressors of the major functions of some freshwater
  fish immune system.

  immatures were collected frequently from freshwater surface pools. Overall,
  13,561 adults (386 pools) and 91,547 adults reared from field-collected
  immatures (3,027 pools) were tested for arboviruses by plaque assay in Vero

  (minimum field infection rate = 1.07 per 1,000), verifying the maintenance of
  this virus by vertical transmission. All remaining pools were negative. Three
  flocks of 10 sentinel chickens and one group of 5 sentinel rabbits were bled
  biweekly and tested for arbovirus antibodies with negative results. Neither
  horizontal nor vertical transmission of western equine encephalomyelitis virus

AB: Since 1971, the herring gull (Larus argentatus) has been used as a sentinel
  species for monitoring the levels of persistent contaminants in the Great Lakes
  ecosystem. In this study, 21 herring gull colonies in the Great Lakes and
  connecting channels were sampled during 1972-1976, 1981-1983, 1985 and 1992.
  For each year, 10 eggs (usually) were collected from each colony site and
  analyzed for total mercury ( mu g/g, wet wt). Results indicated that eggs from
  Lake Ontario displayed the highest lake-wide mercury levels (0.28-0.73 mu g/g),
  followed by Lake Superior (0.21-0.50 mu g /g). Lake Erie typically displayed
  the lowest mercury levels (0.18-0.24 mu g/g). Overall, mercury levels ranged
  from 0.12 mu g/g in 1985 to 0.88 mu g/g in 1982 for Channel Shelter Island
  (Lake Huron) and Pigeon Island (Lake Ontario), respectively. Generally, all
  colony sites showed peak egg mercury levels in 1982. A significant decline in
  egg mercury levels was observed in five colony sites for the period 1972-1992
  and in three different colony sites for the period 1981-1992. Mercury levels in
  the eggs of herring gulls for the period of this study were below levels
  associated with acute toxic effects in this species but were within a range,
  for certain years, which potentially reduces hatchability in other avian
  species.

  and by Western blotting using monoclonal anti-cod CYP1A (MAb-NP7). Tissue
  distribution of CYP1A activity was examined immunohistochemically in sagittal
  sections of whole animals by staining with the same MAb-NP7. Bile was analyzed
  for BaP and its metabolites in terms of fluorescent aromatic compounds (FACs)
  using synchronous scanning fluorometry. Tilapia were also exposed to super(3)H
  -BaP in water and the distribution patterns studied by whole-body
  autoradiography. The results indicated a dose-dependent increase in EROD
  activity and CYP1A protein levels in all tissues studied, both parameters being
  higher, as expected, in the liver than in the other organs. There was no
  detectable EROD activity in the extrahepatic organs of control fish. A dose
  -responsive increase was also observed with FACs in the bile.
  Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated high levels of CYP1A-associated
  staining in the liver, kidney, and in the lining of the alimentary tract,
  moderate to mild staining in the brain, nasal area, vertebral column, lining of
  the gall bladder, urinary bladder and skin, gills, heart and spleen. The
  autoradiographical patterns observed indicated general uptake of super(3)H-BaP
  via water and gastrointestinal tract, with the bile, intestine and its
  contents, gills, and liver as the sites with the highest concentrations of
  radiolabeled compounds. This is the first demonstration of utilizing CYP1A
  activity measurements, whole-body autoradiography and immunohistochemistry to
  study tissue distribution and effects of BaP in tilapia. The study extends the
  data base for using tilapia as a pollution sentinel indicator species with
  CYP1A and biliary fluorescence as potential biomarkers in pollution monitoring
  in tropical developing countries (DBO).

AB: The impact of a combined approach to schistosomiasis control from 1987 to
  1989 and mass chemotherapy from 1992 to 1994 was studied in a rural community
  in Xingzi county in the northwest corner of Poyang Lake in Jiangxi Province,
  China. Humans, cattle, buffalo and pigs were known potential reservoirs of
  Schistosoma japonicum. Transmission occurs during water contact on and around
  seasonally flooded marshes that are used for grazing, the harvesting of grass
  and fishing. Humans and livestock underwent yearly selective mass chemotherapy,
  and snails were eliminated through ploughing and compacting of the marshland in
  the spring of 1988. Transmission was monitored through the determination of
  annual re-infection rates in samples of the human population, the annual
  examination of piles of feces from animals and humans in the marshland, the
  annual collection and examination of intermediate snail hosts, and the exposure
  to potentially polluted water and subsequent examination of sentinel mice.
  Schistosomiasis prevalence among humans and animals declined sharply as soon as
  mass chemotherapy was implemented. Snail density decreased even before mollusc
  control was started, possibly indicating a high variability of this indicator.
  The infection rates of snails and sentinel mice reached zero after a single
  application of mollusc control. The results underline the importance of single
  infected water buffalo for the transmission of schistosomiasis. Since the
  impact stopped for two years (1990-1991), the schistosomiasis prevalence rose
  quickly. Mass chemotherapy was an effective means to curb the prevalence of
  schistosomiasis in this area, but the effects were only maintained for one or
  two years in the marsh zone.

AB: Arsenic, copper, zinc, cadmium, lead and mercury were determined in the
  muscle and liver of two species of fish, saithe (Gadus virens) and flounder
  (Platichthys flesus), and in the soft tissues of blue mussels (Mytilus edulis).
  These were sampled from eight locations along the Hardangerfjord up to 100 km
  from the source of the pollution at the head of the fjord. Both relative and
  absolute amounts of the six elements differed between the two species of fish,
  and, more so, between the two tissues. The mussel contained higher amounts of
  the elements than the fish. The pattern of the elements was also very different
  in the mussel. Differences and similarities among the various types of samples
  from the eight locations were evaluated by principal component analysis.
  Correlation between the six elements was also tested by this method. A
  concentration gradient away from the source of pollution was only found for
  arsenic in the saithe tissues, while the only gradient detected in flounder was
  for mercury in the liver tissue. In mussels the gradient for arsenic was
  marginal, while gradients were detected in varying degrees for the other
  elements. Cadmium did not correlate with the other elements in mussels. The
  mussel was found to be a much better sentinel organism for these elements,
  except arsenic, than the two fish species.

AB: Quantification of levels of cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) gene expression in
  sentinel species of fishes has been proposed as a management tool to evaluate
  contamination of aquatic systems. Based on preliminary studies, we hypothesized
  that differences in CYP1A mRNA inducibility among individuals, populations, or
  species might lead to spurious conclusions when using this approach in
  environmental monitoring programs. To address this possibility, we quantitated
  and compared CYP1A mRNA induction levels in four species of common Atlantic
  Coast estuarine fish: smooth flounder (Pleuronectes putnami), hogchoker
  (Trinectes maculatus), striped bass (Morone saxatilis), and Atlantic tomcod
  (Microgadus tomcod), which were treated with model chemicals (beta
  naphthoflavone ( beta -NF), or benzo[a]pyrene at 10 ppm) known to induce CYP1A
  mRNA, or were exposed to contaminated environments. Species-specific CYP1A DNA
  probes were generated from PCR (polymerase chain reaction) amplification of
  genomic DNA using conserved oligonucleotide primers, and, along with cloned
  rainbow trout and Atlantic tomcod CYP1A cDNA probes were used to quantify CYP1A
  mRNA levels in northern blot analyses. Successful PCR amplification of CYP1A
  hybridizable DNA fragments was observed for all four species. Results from
  northern blot analyses showed large differences in CYP1A mRNA induction among
  species; only Atlantic tomcod exhibited significant induction of CYP1A mRNA for
  both chemically treated (97-fold) and environmentally exposed fish (34-fold).
  Significant, although lower, levels of induction were observed in beta -NF
  treated (14-fold) smooth flounder, but not in environmentally exposed smooth
  flounder. Only low levels (not significant) of CYP1A gene induction were
  detected in hogchokers and striped bass. We conclude that CYP1A mRNA
  inducibility differed significantly among fish taxa perhaps due to differences
  in regulation of gene expression, suggesting that careful selection of sentinel
  species should be exercised prior to the use of CYP1A mRNA induction in
  environmental monitoring programs. However, the significance of differences in
  CYP1A mRNA inducibility in relation to higher level biological endpoints has
  yet to be determined.

AB: Survey results are presented from 34 sentinel sites in 18 counties in
  endemic water-borne fluorosis areas of China through the years of 1991 and
  1992. The progress in improving water to control fluorosis was very slow. By
  the end of 1991, only 42.1% of the villages, and 39.3% of the population, in
  endemic fluorosis areas had improved water supplies. In 1992 this improvement
  increased by only 1%. Inspection of 987 water improvement projects to reduce
  fluoride showed that 82.7% were continuously used, 10.3% had interrupted use,
  and 7.0% had been stopped or destroyed. The projects resulted in 65.4% having a
  water fluoride content of less than 1.0 mg/L, 21.3% had 1.0-1.5 mg/L, and 15.4%
  had more than 1.5 mg/L. In 34 sentinel sites, urinary fluoride content and
  dental fluorosis indices of 8-12 year old children decreased year by year,
  especially in the sites with longer water improvement and water fluoride
  content less than 1.0 mg/L. Symptoms and signs of adult fluorosis also
  decreased, but not as significantly as the urinary fluoride content and dental
  fluorosis of children.

AB: Because of the wide use of pesticides for domestic and industrial purposes,
  the evaluation of their immunotoxic effects is of major concern for public
  health. Despite the large amount of experimental data describing pesticide
  -induced immunosuppression, evidence that pesticides may severely impair immune
  functions in humans is lacking or scarce. Contact hypersensitivity is a well
  -identified immunotoxic effect of pesticides but remains a rare complaint in
  pesticide-exposed workers. By contrast, immunologically mediated systemic
  reactions have been described only as debatable case reports. The association
  between autoimmune diseases and pesticide exposure has more recently been
  suggested. Despite the lack of convincing human data, a potential risk for the
  immune system should not be excluded, especially during chronic exposure to
  pesticides or in otherwise (immuno)compromised patients (malnutrition,
  children, old patients). Epidemiological studies including markers of exposure
  and the assessment of immune competence in exposed individuals, or registries
  of sentinel diseases related to immunosuppression (e.g., non-Hodgkin's
  lymphoma, opportunistic infections) or autoimmunity (e.g., lupus erythematosus,
  rheumatoid arthritis), are warranted.

AB: The toxicologic pathology of petroleum and oilfield-related chemicals is
  reviewed, and a field guide for toxicopathologic evaluation of cattle is given.
  Cattle will voluntarily ingest petroleum and chemicals used in the exploration,
  production and transportation of crude petroleum. Variability in chemical
  composition of petroleum from different fields will alter the type and severity
  of lesions observed. When airborne pollutants are present, cattle are
  continually exposed and make excellent sentinel animals. The lung, kidney,
  liver, gastrointestinal tract, heart and brain are target organs for petroleum
  hydrocarbons. Exposure to elemental sulfur can produce pulmonary pathology.
  Sulfur-containing gases are irritating to the mucosa of the eye and respiratory
  tract. Arsenic and lead cause lesions in the gastrointestinal tract, brain,
  liver and kidney. Glycols are hepato-, nephro- and neurotoxic, and oral
  exposure to diethylene glycol produces corneal lesions. Invert drilling fluids
  are fetotoxic. Nonpesticide organophosphate esters target the peripheral and
  central nervous systems. Toxicopathy is a strategic tool in the diagnosis of
  intoxications occurring in cattle after exposure to oilfield chemicals. Cattle
  are sensitive to oilfield pollutants and are a useful biomonitoring species.

AB: To investigate potential causal relationships between contaminant exposure
  and biological responses in fish, a suite of bioindicators ranging from the
  biochemical to the community-level were measured in fish populations and
  communities downstream from a bleached kraft mill effluent discharge.
  Downstream gradients in responses were evident in elevated hepatic mixed
  -function oxygenase activity, several measures of condition and bioenergetic
  status, growth, the health assessment index, and several fish community-level
  parameters. A multivariate discriminant analysis procedure, which included many
  of the individual bioindicators, also demonstrated a gradient in integrated
  health status of a sentinel fish species in the contaminated river. These
  downstream response gradients were probably influenced to a greater degree by
  contaminant discharges than by natural or anthropogenic nutrient sources
  downstream. Establishing causal relationships between a specific contaminant
  source and responses in sentinel aquatic organisms becomes relatively more
  straightforward when downstream gradients in biological responses are observed
  at multiple levels of biological organization.

AB: In response to native Alaskans' concerns, subsistence seafoods were analyzed
  to determine levels of contamination and to assess the safety of consuming
  these foods after the Exxon Valdez oil spill. This article includes the results
  of analyses from approximately 1,000 samples of blue mussels Mytilus edulis,
  butter clams Saxidomus giganteus, Pacific littlenecks Protothaca staminea, and
  chitons (order Neoloricata). Between July 1989 and August 1991, samples of
  invertebrate species were collected from 80 stations near 22 native Alaskan
  subsistence seafood collection areas inside Prince William Sound and along the
  Kenai and Alaska peninsulas. Invertebrates were also collected from two sites
  far away from the spill to serve as reference samples. Samples were analyzed
  for aromatic contaminants consisting of aromatic hydrocarbons and
  dibenzothiophenes that are components of the Prudhoe Bay crude oil spilled by
  the Exxon Valdez. Samples from some stations at Chenega, Windy Bay, Kodiak
  (Village), and Old Harbor consistently had more than 100 ng/g wet weight of
  total aromatic contaminants (moderately or highly contaminated). Generally,
  molluscs sampled from the majority of stations and from the reference areas
  near Angoon and Yakutat were not contaminated or were only minimally
  contaminated with aromatic contaminants (concentrations were less than 100 ng/g
  wet weight). In an advisory opinion, the Food and Drug Administration, in
  conjunction with the Alaska Oil Spill Health Task Force, indicated that little
  risk was involved in consumption of the subsistence seafoods studied, as long
  as visibly oiled organisms were avoided. Because invertebrates can serve as
  sentinel organisms for evaluating the decline in concentrations of aromatic
  contaminants over time, continued analyses of these organisms are also
  important for monitoring recovery from oil contamination.

AB: A field study has been carried out to validate the measure of structural
  changes in the digestive lysosomal system of sentinel mussels as biomarkers of
  environmental stress. Previous laboratory studies demonstrated that the
  digestive lysosomal system of molluscs reponds to a variety of pollutants and
  to different stress situations by exhibiting significant changes in its
  structure. Mussels were collected monthly over 1 year at the Abra Estuary
  (Bizkaia, Biscay Bay) from six sites with different degrees of pollution. The
  changes in the structure of the digestive lysosomes were quantified on cryostat
  sections of the digestive gland by means of automated image analysis. Four
  stereological parameters were recorded: lysosomal volume density, surface
  density, surface-to-volume ratio and numerical density. A seasonal pattern in
  the structure of the digestive lysosomes was evidenced with reduced volume,
  surface, size and numbers of lysosomes in winter-spring; increased volume,
  surface, size and numbers in summer and an intermediate situation in autumn.
  The structure of digestive lysosomes was also dissimilar among sites, the most
  significant differences being found between Plentzia (nonpolluted site) and
  Galea (polluted site). The digestive lysosomes of mussels collected from Galea
  were smaller and more abundant than in Plentzia's mussels in most sampling
  times. The basis of these differences are discussed to conclude that organic
  chemical pollution might be the cause for these specific changes which are
  different from the enlargement of digestive lysosomes described as a result of
  various sources of environmental stress. It is concluded that structural
  changes in the digestive lysosomes of sentinel mussels are sensitive to
  pollution-induced environmental stress even in the complex situation of the
  field where many factors may interact to affect the structure of the digestive
  lysosomal system.

AB: This paper reports concentrations of total Hg (both organic and inorganic)
  in different selected biota (seagrass, gastropods, bivalves and fishes)
  collected from the coastal regions of deltaic Sundarbans, West Bengal, India.
  Species-dependent variability is very much distinct where high level of Hg was
  found in carnivorous species. A high degree of organ specificity was pronounced
  in case of bivalves where gill and mantle exhibited higher Hg accumulation due
  to the ion exchange activity of the mucous in these organs. The available data
  demonstrates the potentiality of the shellfishes as sentinel accumulators of
  this element and they can be successfully used as sensitive index of pollution.
  The data also reveals that this coastal zone is getting polluted and necessary
  preventive measures must be adopted to make the best possible use of the
  available marine resources.

AB: The production of specific mutations in cellular oncogenes and tumor
  suppressor genes is thought to be involved in the development of certain
  cancers related to exposures to chemical carcinogens. The occurrence of certain
  point mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes results in the
  expression of mutant forms of their encoded protein products, which is believed
  to contribute to the process of cellular transformation and thus cancer. The
  detection of the expression of such mutant protein products in vivo could
  therefore serve as potential biomarkers for the molecular epidemiologic study
  of chemical carcinogenesis in human populations exposed to carcinogen. A model
  system for such study is provided by workers who have been occupationally
  exposed to high levels of vinyl chloride (VC) and are at risk for the
  development of a sentinel neoplasm, angiosarcoma of the liver (ASL).

AB: The present investigation was to determine the extent to which mercury (Hg)
  provokes measurable effects on the structure of the digestive gland of slugs as
  well as to relate the extent of these effects to the cell and tissue
  distribution of Hg. For this purpose, slugs (Arion ater) received various
  dietary concentrations of Hg (from 0 to 1,000 mu g Hg/g food) as chloride for
  30 days and were histologically examined every third day. Autometallography was
  used to demonstrate Hg as black silver deposits (BSD) in paraffin sections. The
  lysosomes and residual bodies of digestive cells resulted to be the major
  accumulation sites. In addition, Hg was also evidenced in lipofuscine granules
  of vacuoles in excretory cells but, however, it was rarely observed within
  calcium cells. Generally, the extent of BSD increased with dietary Hg
  concentration and exposure time but, however, it became significant lowered
  after exposure to 1,000 mu g Hg/g food for 30 when the digestive epithelium
  appeared almost devoid of digestive cells. On the other hand, significant
  changes were recorded in the quantitative structure of digestive tubules. Mean
  Epithelial Thickness (MET), Mean Luminal Radius (MLR) and Mean Diverticular
  Radius (MDR) were recorded as measures of the sublethal biological effect of
  Hg. MET, MLR/MET and MET/MDR were affected by Hg concentration (C), exposure
  time (T) and CxT interaction, changes in MET, MLR, MLR/MET and MET/MDR being
  explained by regression models after logarithmic transformation of the data. In
  order to explain the nature of the changes in the quantitative structure of the
  digestive tubules this investigation was complemented with qualitative
  histological observations. According to them, the excretory activity in
  digestive cells was initially enhanced. Afterwards, the relative numbers of
  digestive cells declined until the extreme cases of exposure to 1,000 mu g Hg/g
  for 27 to 30 days in which the digestive epithelium was mostly comprised of
  calcium and excretory cells. Concomitantly, some changes took place in blood
  vessels where Leydig cells became disrupted and the connective tissue layers
  thickened. Finally, it is suggested to use slugs in soil quality assessment as
  sentinel organisms ("Slug Watch") in which biomarkers of exposure to metallic
  pollutants and of biological effect are recorded.

AB: The objective was to study injuries in young people associated with the use
  of rollerblades, draw comparisons with skateboarding and rollerskating
  injuries, and suggest strategies for injury prevention. Injuries associated
  with the use of rollerblades, skateboards and rollerskates in young people aged
  less than or equal to 14 years recorded on the Victorian Injury Surveillance
  System database since its inception in 1989 were examined to identify secular
  trends. All injuries associated with these pastimes recorded on the database by
  three sentinel hospitals during a 1 year period were examined in detail.
  Medical notes were perused to verify features of the event and obtain further
  information. A semi-structured telephone interview of a sample of 10-14 year
  old rollerbladers, the most commonly injured age-group, was carried out to
  obtain more specific information. There has been a marked increase in the
  absolute numbers of injuries associated with the use of rollerblades since
  1989. In 1992, they were most common in the 10-14 year age group, which
  sustained 59% of all injuries; 47% of injuries were fractures of the forearm
  and wrist. Of a sample of 33 of those injured in the 10-14 year age group, 10
  (30%) had been using rollerblades for the first time. There is some evidence to
  suggest a concomitant fall in skateboarding injuries. Injury surveillance data
  collected in Melbourne suggest an increasingly important contribution by
  rollerblading to the pattern of injury seen in young people. Preventive
  strategies require further evaluation but could include learning basic
  techniques in a controlled setting, separation from road traffic and the
  wearing of helmets and wrist, elbow and knee guards.

AB: A series of 12 outdoor model stream mesocosms was designed to evaluate the
  effects of chemicals and mixtures on the biota in stream ecosystems. An
  integrated design plan incorporated physical, chemical, and biological factors
  as well as the specific experimental objectives and effects parameters to be
  evaluated. Analysis of biological assemblages such as macroinvertebrates and
  periphyton in the model stream mesocosms demonstrated the presence of diverse
  and sensitive taxa. These model stream mesocosms also included the ability to
  evaluate responses of sentinel fish species such as Pimephales promelas and
  Lepomis macrochirus as well as macrophytes. The design and construction of the
  stream are discussed in detail and a brief description of a typical
  experimental protocol is provided. Experiments, to date, have spanned 14-30
  days pretreatment "colonization" with 30 days of treatment and 15 days of
  posttreatment observation. Precision and accuracy of test chemical delivery to
  the stream have been excellent and the overall experimental design has been
  useful for delivering threshold toxicity concentrations and evaluating
  ecosystem potency for the chemicals tested.

AB: Zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha, were collected monthly from a copper
  -contaminated reservoir over a period of nearly 3 years. Copper concentrations
  in the organisms showed marked fluctuations reflecting changes in the water
  contamination. Bioconcentration patterns were influenced by the specific
  capacity of this sentinel organism to biologically integrate the continuously
  evolving water pollution; the sampling pattern, which inevitably introduced a
  certain subjectivity into monitoring results; and weight changes in the animals
  within the yearly cycle. Consequently, the successive monthly indications
  obtained with the zebra mussels provided a current biological assessment of a
  complex dynamic contamination situation. In a second experiment, caged mussels
  from three different populations were transferred for 3 months into the
  reservoir and sampled on six occasions. Mortality rates, attachment capacity,
  and a condition index revealed no substantial fitness disturbances in the
  transplanted organisms. Differences in dry weight throughout the experiment
  were attributable to the initial characteristics of each population. The
  influence of body mass on monitoring results was eliminated by replacing copper
  concentrations ( mu g/g dry weight) with copper burdens ( mu g/specimen). In
  terms of copper burdens, the three transplanted populations exhibited very
  similar metal patterns. Moderate quantitative differences between introduced
  and indigenous populations were interpreted as the result of physiological
  adaptation of the indigenous mussels to their contaminated environment. This
  study showed that the transfer technique with D. polymorpha is a useful tool
  for active biomonitoring programs.

AB: The study assesses the ecological impact caused by the El Salvador untreated
  (1975-1990) and treated (1991-1994) copper mine tailings on rocky intertidal
  communities in and around the dumping site at Caleta Palito, northern Chile.
  Ecological changes are monitored for 16 years in polluted and unpolluted sites
  within a geographical area of 90 km. Copper concentration levels in water and
  the intertidal Chlorophyta E. compressa are presented. The results confirm a
  notorious reduction in the number of species and significant differences
  between polluted and unpolluted intertidal communities. At polluted sites,
  following the initiation of the disposal, all species of invertebrates and
  algae disappeared and primary space (rock) was partially or completely
  dominated by E. compressa along more than a decade. Its persistence in these
  sites supports the view that this taxon is a sentinel species resisting high
  levels of copper pollution. During the past four years, following the steps
  given to treat the tailings, at polluted sites there are preliminary
  indications showing increases in the number of species of algae and
  invertebrate. The need for future monitoring to elucidate ecosystem restoration
  process is discussed.

DE: food-borne-diseases; worldwide-surveillance; international-cooperation
AB: A foodborne-disease surveillance program is an essential part of a food
  safety program. Foodborne surveillance should be able to issue early alerts on
  contaminated food to which a large population is exposed; collate notifications
  of enteric diseases and laboratory isolations; report foodborne disease
  incidents on a regular basis; and use sentinel and specific epidemiological
  studies as required. Although most countries have some kind of reporting of
  notifiable diseases, few have foodborne-disease surveillance programs, and
  little is known of foodborne disease in general on a worldwide basis. However,
  in the last decade many European countries have generated annual reports to
  join those of Canada, England/Wales, Japan and the United States. In addition,
  a few other countries are attempting to develop foodborne-disease reporting
  programs but are hampered by lack of resources. However, it is apparent that
  staphylococcal intoxication has been decreasing in most nations, except in some
  Latin American countries where cheese from unpasteurized milk and cream-filled
  desserts are widely consumed. In contrast, salmonellosis has been increasing or
  remaining steady as the main foodborne disease in practically all other
  countries. Newly-recognized agents such as E. coli O157:H7 and other
  verotoxigenic E. coli, or previously-known agents in new food associations such
  as Clostridium botulinum, are also being documented in several countries.
  Although the socioeconomic impact of foodborne diseases is very high, there are
  at best limited effective control measures to reduce them, even in
  industrialized countries. One reason control is difficult to achieve is that
  surveillance is inadequate and the burden of foodborne disease is not fully
  understood by policy-makers. Another reason is that a consistent and
  coordinated effort by industry and government is required, as has been
  practiced in Sweden to reduce substantially the Salmonella contamination of
  poultry. Improvement of surveillance on a worldwide basis is all the more
  important with increasing world trade and travel, and international
  organizations need to take a lead role in accomplishing this.

AB: The objective of the study was to check the occurrence of phenotypic
  manifestations of germinal mutations in children born within a 30 km radius of
  the Paks nuclear power plant, Hungary. The study took the form of a comparative
  analysis between observed and expected rates based on the Hungarian baseline
  rates, as well as between children born before and after the operation of the
  nuclear plant. Data were taken from the database of the Hungarian Congenital
  Abnormality Registry completed by active search in the study region, and
  comprised 26 893 children born between 1980 and 1992 in the 55 settlements of
  the study region. The results were presented as overall figures as well as
  being grouped by different congenital abnormalities, in addition to the so
  -called indicators of germinal mutations: sentinel anomalies, Down syndrome and
  unidentified multiple congenital abnormalities. The observed occurrence of all
  but one group of congenital abnormalities corresponded to the expected rate, as
  did the three groups of indicator conditions. Of the 55 settlements, eight had
  spatial clusters; however, these could be explained by overdiagnosis or chance.
  There was no significant increase in the variables studied after the operation
  of the nuclear plant. We conclude that the slightly elevated radiation
  background (0.2-0.4 mu Sv/year) due to the operation of the nuclear plant
  studied does not affect germinal and somatic mutations in children.

AB: Farm-raised 12-month-old female mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were released
  at the Winston-Thomas sewage treatment plant, Bloomington, Indiana. Five
  mallards were sacrificed at the start of the study and at approximately 10-day
  intervals through day 100. Concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)
  in carcasses increased linearly with time of exposure and exceeded 16 mu g/g
  wet weight by day 100; PCBs in breast muscle exceeded 3.9 mu g/g by day 100.
  These PCB values are among the highest recorded for wild or sentinel waterfowl.
  PCB concentrations in breast muscle (26-523 mu g/g lipid weight) were 50-1,000
  times greater than human consumption guidelines for edible poultry in Canada
  (0.5 mu g/g lipid weight) and 9-176 times greater than consumption guidelines
  for edible poultry in the United States (3.0 mu g/g lipid weight).
  Additionally, PCB concentrations in carcass and breast muscle exceeded the
  threshold of the Great Lakes Sport Fish Consumption Advisory 'do not eat'
  category (1.9 mu g/g wet weight) by day 20 and day 50, respectively. Hepatic
  cytochrome P450-associated monooxygenases including BROD (benzyloxyresorufin-O
  -dealkylase), EROD (ethoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase), and PROD (pentoxyresorufin-O
  -dealkylase) were induced over 5-fold compared to reference mallards. BROD,
  EROD, and PROD were each significantly correlated to total PCBs and to the
  toxicity of selected PCB congeners, relative to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p
  -dioxin.

AB: Objectives. The incidence of related sentinel events-breast cancer mortality
  and neighborhood-specific morbidity for advanced stage at diagnosis-were
  calculated for women likely to use a community health center in Denver, Colo.
  Methods. For the center's service area, neighborhoods (n = 37) were defined by
  program use. Mortality rates and proportional hazards regression models were
  estimated for 4189 breast cancer cases recorded between 1979 and 1990.
  Neighborhood-specific standard morbidity ratios of advanced-stage tumors were
  based on age-specific rates applied to the entire community. Results. Service
  area residents were more likely to present with advanced tumors (odds ratio
  [OR] = 1.4; 95% [CI] = 1.2, 1.5). After adjustment, advanced-stage disease and
  socioeconomic-demographic status, but not race-ethnicity, contributed
  significantly to survival. Two neighborhoods (6.5% of the population at risk)
  with standard morbidity ratios of 2.1 (95% CI = 1.3, 3.4) and 1.7 (95% CI =
  1.2, 2.5) accounted for 42% of the excess cases of advanced-stage tumors
  between 1986 and 1990. Conclusions. Neighborhood variation in advanced-stage
  cancer can serve as the basis for efforts to improve access to breast cancer
  screening.

AB: National unlinked sentinel surveillance data were used to describe trends in
  prevalent human immunodeficiency virus infection among injection drug users
  entering drug treatment programs in the United States from 1988 through 1993.
  During this 6-year period, unlinked testing was performed on 70,882 specimens
  from injection drug users at 60 sentinel sites. The annual change in
  seroprevalence was estimated for each site by odds ratios obtained from
  logistic regression models fit within site-specific age and race/ethnicity
  subgroups. Overall trends for age and race/ethnicity subgroups across sites
  were described by summary odds ratios calculated using the inverse variance
  method. A decrease was observed among younger (age less than 30 years) whites
  both in areas with high (10% or higher) and low (less than 10%) prevalence,
  although this decrease was significant only in high-prevalence areas (odds
  ratio = 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.81-0.99). Seroprevalence also decreased
  among older whites in high-prevalence areas, although this decrease was not
  significant (odds ratio = 0.95, 95% confidence interval 0.89-1.00).
  Seroprevalence remained stable among all other age and race/ethnicity
  subgroups. Stable seroprevalence among the dynamic population of injection drug
  users entering treatment suggests continued transmission among these
  individuals in both high- and low-prevalence areas of the United States.

AB: Since October 1990, when human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)
  infection was first detected in Vietnam, nearly 2000 virus-infected persons
  have been identified through sentinel surveillance. The Ministry of Health in
  Vietnam, however, places the actual prevalence of HIV-1 infection at 10- or 100
  -fold higher. Currently, nationwide HIV-1 seroprevalence rates are estimated to
  be nearly 10% for injection drug users (IDUs), 3% for female commercial sex
  workers (CSWs), and 2% for males attending clinics for sexually transmitted
  diseases (STDs). These estimated prevalences are comparable to those observed
  in the same risk groups in Thailand 5 years ago. That said, it is uncertain if
  concurrent epidemics with different HIV-1 subtypes are occurring among
  different high risk-behavior groups in Vietnam. To clarify this issue, we
  conducted a genotypic analysis of HIV-1 from IDUs and CSWs in Vietnam.

AB: To assess trends in HIV infection among sexually transmitted disease (STD)
  patients. Repeated unlinked anonymous survey, 1991-1993. STD clinics in Paris,
  France. Patients (n = 4354) with a new suspected STD. HIV antibody testing,
  using blood from syphilis samples. HIV prevalences were stable over time in all
  transmission groups. One-third of homo-/bisexual men were HIV-positive.
  Prevalence was 2.5 times higher among heterosexual patients from Africa or the
  Caribbean than among those from other countries. Among patients under 25 years
  of age prevalence significantly decreased from 4.3% in 1991 to 0.8% in 1993 (P
  = 0.01). Among homo-/bisexual men, despite a 50% reduction in the incidence of
  STD, the absolute number of those newly HIV-infected remained stable; median
  age increased from 28 years in 1991 to 32 years in 1993 (P = 0.02). Among
  heterosexuals, trends in HIV incidence were difficult to assess: recently
  infected patients were more likely to be identified in 1993 than in 1991, since
  the proportion of patients who reported a recent HIV-negative test increased
  over time. Prevalence studies contribute to define specific subgroups which
  should be targeted for prevention (HIV-positive or older homosexuals,
  heterosexuals from Africa and the Caribbean). Despite a decrease in both
  overall STD incidence and HIV prevalence among patients aged under 25 years,
  overall HIV incidence has not decreased, at least among homo-/bisexual men in
  whom recent HIV infections occurred at a high rate overall, and increased in
  those aged 35 years or more. Sentinel site-based HIV seroprevalence studies are
  best interpreted in the light of results obtained from different populations
  and through routine surveillance of STD.

AB: To see whether effects of air pollutants and other environmental factors on
  the respiratory tract can be detected by the Swiss sentinel reporting system,
  two years' data of asthma bronchiale and exacerbation of chronic bronchitis
  were analyzed. On average, 16 cases of asthma and 9 cases of bronchitis were
  reported per week. The respective figures expressed as mean percentages of all
  consultations were 0.12% and 0.065%. Data of SO2, NO2, ozone and total
  suspended particles were used to measure air pollution. Additionally,
  meteorologic parameters such as air temperature and atmospheric pressure were
  used, as well as the appearance of the most important pollen groups in
  Switzerland: grass, birch tree and mugwort. Environmental data were summarized
  using the mean or sum of all measuring stations. Autocorrelations in the time
  series were accounted for statistically. Our analysis could not establish any
  relationship between reports of asthma or exacerbation of chronic bronchitis
  and air pollutants or other environmental data. This result, which is partly
  contradicted by the literature, could be explained by low numbers of reports
  due to patient's self administration of medication and an imprecise
  determination of true exposure.

AB: The collection of dried blood spots (DBS) on filter paper provides a
  powerful approach for the development of large-scale, population-based
  screening programs. DBS methods are particularly valuable in developing
  countries and isolated rural regions where resources are limited. Large numbers
  of field specimens can be economically collected and shipped to centralized
  reference laboratories for genetic and (or) serological analysis.
  Alternatively, the dried blood can be stored and used as an archival resource
  to rapidly establish the frequency and distribution of newly recognized
  mutations, confirm patient identity or track the origins and emergence of newly
  identified pathogens. In this report, we describe how PCR-based technologies
  are beginning to interface with international screening programmes for the
  diagnosis and genetic characterization of human immunodeficiency virus type 1
  (HIV-1). In particular, we review recent progress using DBS specimens to
  resolve the HIV-1 infection status of neonates, monitor the genetic evolution
  of HIV-1 during early infancy and establish a sentinel surveillance system for
  the systematic monitoring of HIV-1 genetic variation in Asia.

AB: In a representative sample of 72 sentinel practices in Lower Saxony and 61
  sentinel practices in Saxony-Anhalt, physicians were requested to record all
  consultations of asthmatic children (aged up to 8 years) over a period of 6 and
  3 months, respectively. Children were classified as asymptomatic or newly
  symptomatic at each separate contact. Asymptomatic contacts with respiratory
  tract infections were excluded. From measurements of fixed air monitoring
  stations, the exposure to air pollutants (NO2, NO, SO2, ozone, particulates) at
  the place of the physician's practice (Lower Saxony) or at the child's
  residence (Saxony-Anhalt) was estimated, using a specific interpolation method
  (inverse distance weighting). Associations between exposure to particular air
  pollutants and the presence of asthmatic symptoms at the time of the
  consultation were determined using logistic regression. Temperature, month of
  the consultation region, day of the week, first or repeated contact in the
  recording period were included as covariates in the multivariate analyses to
  adjust for potential confounding. NO2 exposure was significantly and positively
  associated with the occurrence of asthmatic symptoms (p = 0.007). Exposure to
  other air pollutants did not significantly differ between asymptomatic and
  symptomatic contacts. A possible causal relationship between NO2 exposure and
  the occurrence of asthmatic symptoms in children suffering from asthma is in
  accordance with other studies. Our study adds data from routine office based
  outpatient care to independent evidence on the association between NO2 exposure
  and asthma.

AB: An increasing number of early and minimally invasive breast cancers are
  being detected by mammography screening. The role of image-guided core biopsy
  in nonpalpable breast lesion evaluation is being defined, with issues of cost
  -effectiveness, diagnostic accuracy, and ability to direct definitive
  management remaining to be elucidated. The long-term efficacy of breast
  conservation therapy for early breast cancer continues to be confirmed. Review
  of special issues in breast conservation therapy demonstrates no benefit to
  eliminating adjunctive radiation therapy or to limiting therapy in the elderly
  patient with breast cancer. The distribution of cancer in the duct-lobular
  system indicates the potential for radical segmental extension. It also
  influences local recurrence following breast-conserving surgery. Sentinel lymph
  node dissection may supplant standard axillary dissection as a major prognostic
  determinant of metastatic disease. These areas of scientific investigation
  continue to define the role of surgery in early and minimally invasive breast
  cancer.

  compared with thick blood films, for the detection of malarial parasites. The
  positivity rate was 25% by the AO-QBC technique and was 18% by the thick film
  technique. The increased sensitivity, combined with the rapidity and simplicity
  of the AO-QBC technique, establishes its superiority over the conventional
  thick film method, in the sentinel surveillance of malaria, in endemic areas.
  The comparative unit price of the AO-QBC test and conventional microscopy is
  Rs. 38.00 and Rs. 14.00 respectively. But, the ancillary advantages of the AO
  -QBC method over the conventional method more than offset the cost difference.

AB: BACKGROUND: The occurrence of occupational illness and injury has been
  seriously underestimated in Taiwan, which subsequently contributes to
  difficulties in performing effective control of occupational hazards and
  implementing intervention programs for protecting workers. METHODS: Based on
  the successful experience of the nationwide blood lead level surveillance
  program, the Department of Health, the Executive Yuan, Taiwan, Republic of
  China, has established a work-related diseases surveillance system. This
  government-administered system requests practicing physicians to report the
  suspected cases suffering from six categories of work-related disorders.
  RESULTS: An occupational illness and injury surveillance program in Taiwan has
  been in operation since June of 1995. CONCLUSION: Background information of
  work-related diseases obtained from this surveillance system will be useful for
  providing better management of available resources for occupational medicine,
  for preventing hazards, and for enforcing occupational diseases prevention
  programs. Our experience in establishing this surveillance system will be used
  in other countries and settings.

AB: Acute toxic inhalation by irritant, and particularly oxidant, gases has
  until recently been considered to be no more complicated conceptually than a
  chemical burn of the epithelial surface. More recently, however, toxic
  inhalation has been appreciated to be a complex process involving biochemical,
  morphological and functional changes which are quantitatively similar, although
  inducible by different agents. Recent advances in pulmonary pathophysiology,
  inhalation toxicology, and particularly endothelial biology have clarified the
  events occurring at the moment of, and immediately following, exposure to
  oxidant gases. Studies of the pathophysiologic mechanisms associated with toxic
  inhalation by oxidant gases have been relatively static, however. Implications
  of recent findings in related fields illuminate the pathophysiology of toxic
  inhalation. Several principal speakers in this workshop are collaborating in an
  effort to develop a research facility for the study of toxic inhalation injury.
  This would be an international registry to serve as a teaching and research
  facility for documentation of cases of occupational and environmental toxic
  inhalation, considered as lung injury resulting from the inhalation of a toxic
  substance in a workplace setting or an uncontrolled release affecting residents
  of a community. The registry, as proposed, would encourage submissions by
  clinicians and institutions of a data set on each patient and on each incident;
  the registry would further encourage long-term follow-up of subjects and

AB: There has been much debate regarding the work relatedness of carpal tunnel
  syndrome (CTS) and whether workers diagnosed with CTS had pre-existing disease
  at the time they were hired. To elucidate the latter issue, we examined the
  prevalence of abnormal median nerve conduction within the carpal tunnel in
  applicants for industrial jobs. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) were performed
  on both hands of 1,021 applicants following a conditional offer of employment.
  Each applicant completed a self-administered symptom survey specific to the
  upper extremity. Applicants had worked previously for an average of 4.4 (range
  0-33) years and had a mean age of 30.1 (S.D. 8.9) years. Nerve conduction
  studies were performed in a private medical clinic. Sensory palmar latencies
  were determined over an 8 cm segment for the median and ulnar nerves. The
  difference between the median and ulnar sensory latencies was the primary
  electrophysiologic measurement used to determine median neuropathy. Using a
  very conservative criterion for abnormal median nerve conduction, 17.5% of the
  applicants were classified with neuropathy in at least one hand. Despite the
  relatively high prevalence of median neuropathy, relatively few (10%) with
  positive NCS acknowledged symptoms associated with CTS. Males had a higher
  percentage of median neuropathy than did females. We conclude that a large
  percentage of industrial workers have objective evidence of abnormal median
  nerve conduction within the carpal tunnel when hired. The high prevalence of
  abnormal median nerve conduction without corresponding symptoms may suggest a
  subclinical entity associated with CTS.

AB: Lead poisoning among workers processing lead sheathed telephone cable was
  identified at five worksites. High blood lead levels (BLLs) were identified
  during the medical evaluation of symptomatic workers following employer
  mandated air monitoring and through employer mandated blood lead levels. Once
  high BLLs were identified, governmental agencies became involved at every site,
  either as a result of worker complaints to OSHA or as a registry reporting
  mechanism. Workplace evaluation revealed significant overexposure to lead,
  particularly among workers mechanically stripping the lead sheaths. After
  intervention by a government agency, four of the workplaces chose to stop lead
  cable processing. Because the ongoing replacement of lead sheathed telephone
  cable with fiber optics may be continuing in many areas of the country, there
  is concern that the clusters we have identified represents a widespread and
  little recognized setting for lead overexposure. Recommendations for preventing
  overexposure to lead in this setting are given.

AB: The toxicologic pathology of petroleum and oilfield-related chemicals is
  reviewed, and a field guide for toxicopathologic evaluation of cattle is given.
  Cattle will voluntarily ingest petroleum and chemicals used in the exploration,
  production and transportation of crude petroleum. Variability in chemical
  composition of petroleum from different fields will alter the type and severity
  of lesions observed. When airborne pollutants are present, cattle are
  continually exposed and make excellent sentinel animals. The lung, kidney,
  liver, gastrointestinal tract, heart and brain are target organs for petroleum
  hydrocarbons. Exposure to elemental sulfur can produce pulmonary pathology.
  Sulfur-containing gases are irritating to the mucosa of the eye and respiratory
  tract. Arsenic and lead cause lesions in the gastrointestinal tract, brain,
  liver and kidney. Glycols are hepato-, nephro- and neurotoxic, and oral
  exposure to diethylene glycol produces corneal lesions. Invert drilling fluids
  are fetotoxic. Nonpesticide organophosphate esters target the peripheral and
  central nervous systems. Toxicopathy is a strategic tool in the diagnosis of
  intoxications occurring in cattle after exposure to oilfield chemicals. Cattle
  are sensitive to oilfield pollutants and are a useful biomonitoring species.

AB: The comet assay, a relatively new method for DNA strand break detection in
  individual cells, is becoming a major tool for environmental biomonitoring. One
  approach for assessing the possible environmental consequences of hazardous
  waste pollution involves the assessment of genotoxic damage (and other effects)
  in sentinel organism. The single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) technique or
  comet assay. because of its simplicity, sensitivity, and need for only small
  numbers of cells, has been suggested as an ideal technique for such studies. An
  important advantage of the technique is that it is applicable to any eukaryotic
  organism and cell type. Verschaeve et al. (1993) conducted a pilot study using
  alkaline comet assay to assess the extent of DNA damage in coelomic leucocytes
  (coelomocytes) of earthworms (Eisenia foetida) maintained in different soil
  samples as an indicator of soil pollution. The aim of our study was to evaluate
  the usefulness of monitoring single strand breaks in coelomocytes for assessing
  genotoxicity of pollutants in coke oven area. We exposed earthworms to samples
  of soils obtained from polluted areas of a coke oven. All samples gave a
  significantly higher comet tail moment that those obtained from worms kept in
  laboratory conditions (standard black earth = internal controls) and worms kept
  in soils from control areas (= external controls). Our results show that the
  comet assay applied to earthworm is very valuable for monitoring and detection
  of genotoxic compounds in terrestrial ecosystems.

AB: The tumor suppressor gene p53 has been identified as the most frequent
  target of genetic alterations in human cancers. Vinyl chloride, a known human
  carcinogen that induces the rare sentinel neoplasm angiosarcoma of the liver,
  has been associated with specific A-->T transversions at the first base of
  codons 249 and 255 of the p53 gene. These mutations result in an Arg-->Trp
  amino acid substitution at residue 249 and an Ile-->Phe amino acid substitution
  at residue 255 in a highly conserved region in the DNA-binding core domain of
  the p53 protein. To determine the effects of these substitutions on the three
  -dimensional structure of the p53 protein, we have performed molecular dynamics
  calculations on this core domain of the wild-type and the Trp-249 and Phe-255
  mutants to compute the average structures of each of the three forms.
  Comparisons of the computed average structures show that both mutants differ
  substantially from the wild-type structure in certain common, discrete regions.
  One of these regions (residues 204-217) contains the epitope for the monoclonal
  antibody PAb240, which is concealed in the wild-type structure but accessible
  in both mutant structures. In order to confirm this conformational shift, tumor
  tissue and serum from vinyl chloride-exposed individuals with angiosarcomas of
  the liver were examined by immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent
  assay. Individuals with tumors that contained the p53 mutations were found to
  have detectable mutant p53 protein in their tumor tissue and serum, whereas
  individuals with tumors without mutations and normal controls did not.

  surveillance: identification or new diseases and causes of injury; estimation
  of the magnitude and trend of injuries and illnesses; identification of
  epidemic clusters; and identification of sentinel cases representing failures
  of prevention. A quiltwork of surveillance systems for occupational diseases
  and injury has been implemented by several federal agencies; surveillance
  systems for many more disease and injuries are being developed by the states.
  The conceptual basis for "closing the surveillance gap" has been developed;

AB: The present investigation was to determine the extent to which mercury (Hg)
  provokes measurable effects on the structure of the digestive gland of slugs as
  well as to relate the extent of these effects to the cell and tissue
  distribution of Hg. For this purpose, slugs (Arion ater) received various
  dietary concentrations of Hg (from 0 to 1,000 microg Hg/g food) as chloride for
  30 days and were histologically examined every third day. Autometallography was
  used to demonstrate Hg as black silver deposits (BSD) in paraffin sections. The
  lysosomes and residual bodies of digestive cells resulted to be the major
  accumulation sites. In addition, Hg was also evidenced in lipofuscine granules
  of vacuoles in excretory cells but, however, it was rarely observed within
  calcium cells. Generally, the extent of BSD increased with dietary Hg
  concentration and exposure time but, however, it became significant lowered
  after exposure to 1,000 microg Hg/g food for 30 when the digestive epithelium
  appeared almost devoid of digestive cells. On the other hand, significant
  changes were recorded in the quantitative structure of digestive tubules. Mean
  Epithelial Thickness (MET), Mean Luminal Radius (MLR) and Mean Diverticular
  Radius (MDR) were recorded as measures of the sublethal biological effect of
  Hg. MET, MLR/MET and MET/MDR were affected by Hg concentration (C), exposure
  time (T) and CxT interaction, changes in MET, MLR, MLR/MET and MET/MDR being
  explained by regression models after logarithmic transformation of the data. In
  order to explain the nature of the changes in the quantitative structure of the
  digestive tubules this investigation was complemented with qualitative
  histological observations. According to them, the excretory activity in
  digestive cells was initially enhanced. Afterwards, the relative numbers of
  digestive cells declined until the extreme cases of exposure to 1, 000 microg
  Hg/g for 27 to 30 days in which the digestive epithelium was mostly comprised
  of calcium and excretory cells. Concomitantly, some changes took place in blood
  vessels where Leydig cells became disrupted and the connective tissue layers
  thickened. Finally, it is suggested to use slugs in soil quality assessment as
  sentinel organisms ("Slug Watch") in which biomarkers of exposure to metallic
  pollutants and of biological effect are recorded.

AB: The objective of the study was to check the occurrence of phenotypic
  manifestations of germinal mutations in children born within a 30 km radius of
  the Paks nuclear power plant, Hungary. The study took the form of a comparative
  analysis between observed and expected rates based on the Hungarian baseline
  rates, as well as between children born before and after the operation of the
  nuclear plant. Data were taken from the database of the Hungarian Congenital
  Abnormality Registry completed by active search in the study region, and
  comprised 26 893 children born between 1980 and 1992 in the 55 settlements of
  the study region. The results were presented as overall figures as well as
  being grouped by different congenital abnormalities, in addition to the so
  -called indicators of germinal mutations: sentinel anomalies, Down syndrome and
  unidentified multiple congenital abnormalities. The observed occurrence of all
  but one group of congenital abnormalities corresponded to the expected rate, as
  did the three groups of indicator conditions. Of the 55 settlements, eight had
  spatial clusters; however, these could be explained by overdiagnosis or chance.
  There was no significant increase in the variables studied after the operation
  of the nuclear plant. We conclude that the slightly elevated radiation
  background (0.2-0.4 microSv/year) due to the operation of the nuclear plant
  studied does not affect germinal and somatic mutations in children.

  effects of chemicals and mixtures on the biota in stream ecosystems. An
  integrated design plan incorporated physical, chemical, and biological factors
  as well as the specific experimental objectives and effects parameters to be
  evaluated. Analysis of biological assemblages such as macroinvertebrates and
  periphyton in the model stream mesocosms demonstrated the presence of diverse
  and sensitive taxa. These model stream mesocosms also included the ability to
  evaluate responses of sentinel fish species such as Pimephales promelas and
  Lepomis macrochirus as well as macrophytes. The design and construction of the
  stream are discussed in detail and a brief description of a typical
  experimental protocol is provided. Experiments, to date, have spanned 14-30
  days pretreatment "colonization" with 30 days of treatment and 15 days of
  posttreatment observation. Precision and accuracy of test chemical delivery to
  the stream have been excellent and the overall experimental design has been
  useful for delivering threshold toxicity concentrations and evaluating

AB: Because of the wide use of pesticides for domestic and industrial purposes,
  the evaluation of their immunotoxic effects is of major concern for public
  health. Despite the large amount of experimental data describing pesticide
  -induced immunosuppression, evidence that pesticides may severely impair immune
  functions in humans is lacking or scarce. Contact hypersensitivity is a well
  -identified immunotoxic effect of pesticides but remains a rare complaint in
  pesticide-exposed workers. By contrast, immunologically mediated systemic
  reactions have been described only as debatable case reports. The association
  between autoimmune diseases and pesticide exposure has more recently been
  suggested. Despite the lack of convincing human data, a potential risk for the
  immune system should not be excluded, especially during chronic exposure to
  pesticides or in otherwise (immuno) compromised patients (malnutrition,
  children, old patients). Epidemiological studies including markers of exposure
  and the assessment of immune competence in exposed individuals, or registries
  of sentinel diseases related to immunosuppression (e.g., non-Hodgkin's
  lymphoma, opportunistic infections) or autoimmunity (e.g. lupus erythematosus,
  rheumatoid arthritis), are warranted.

AB: National unlinked sentinel surveillance data were used to describe trends in
  prevalent human immunodeficiency virus infection among injection drug users
  entering drug treatment programs in the United States from 1988 through 1993.
  During this 6-year period, unlinked testing was performed on 70,882 specimens
  from injection drug users at 60 sentinel sites. The annual change in
  seroprevalence was estimated for each site by odds ratios obtained from
  logistic regression models fit within site-specific age and race/ethnicity
  subgroups. Overall trends for age and race/ethnicity subgroups across sites
  were described by summary odds ratios calculated using the inverse variance
  method. A decrease was observed among younger (age less than 30 years) whites
  both in areas with high (10% or higher) and low (less than 10%) prevalence,
  although this decrease was significant only in high-prevalence areas (odds
  ratio = 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.81-0.99). Seroprevalence also decreased
  among older whites in high-prevalence areas, although this decrease was not
  significant (odds ratio = 0.95, 95% confidence interval 0.89-1.00).
  Seroprevalence remained stable among all other age and race/ethnicity
  subgroups. Stable seroprevalence among the dynamic population of injection drug
  users entering treatment suggests continued transmission among these
  individuals in both high- and low-prevalence areas of the United States.

  generations on the factidious host Ephestia kuehniella Zell. and then released
  on the crop; a 0.5 ha plot situated at 300-400m from the test plots was used as

  were made the first year and three at the same rate per ha the second. ECB
  adult emergence was monitored using traps baited with sex pheromone and
  phenylacetaldehyde food attractant. The parasitoid activity was monitored via
  sentinel egg masses following each release. The parasitization rates of the
  sentinel egg masses was always higher in the release plot vs. control. The
  parasitization of natural egg masses sampled in both years before harvest was:
  12.5 and 10.86% in control as against 87.5 and 68.58% in T. brassicae plots in
  the respective years. ECB damage was calculated on crop ear samples. The rate
  (%) of sentinel egg mass predation by wild predators showed no significant
  difference between control and release plots for both years. The low level of
  ECB damage to crop ears evinced the good search capacity, parasitization and
  control effectiveness of T. brassicae.

AB: Sun exposure has now been established as the most important avoidable cause
  of nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) and melanoma. With specific reference to
  melanoma, there are several key issues that remain to be resolved. These
  include definition of the action spectrum, the importance of systemic effects
  of sun exposure, whether a tan is protective, the risk of tanning booth
  exposures, and the efficacy of sunscreens. Also the role, if any, of sun
  exposure in noncutaneous malignancies remains to be established. Melanoma
  incidence and mortality have increased dramatically over the past several
  decades, but these increases have now slowed, and for mortality among those 15
  to 45 years of age, decreasing rates are now observed. Improving the coverage
  of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries by
  requiring pathology laboratories in non-SEER areas to report cancers among SEER
  area residents will allow correct interpretation of these trends in the future
  at minimal cost. The available data on trends in NMSC incidence and mortality
  are suboptimal but suggest a pattern of declining mortality despite increasing
  incidence. Trends in NMSC morbidity have not been defined. Establishing NMSC
  registries in a few diverse sentinel areas would allow more reliable inference
  and monitoring. Techniques are being developed for reducing sun exposures and
  increasing early detection of skin cancers in the general population, but
  improved monitoring of incidence, mortality, and morbidity is required to
  monitor the effects of current and future ozone depletion and to evaluate
  prevention and early detection measures.

  pulse, causing the flies to be trapped on an adhesive board. The traps were
  suspended in a closed plexiglass chamber and flies introduced directly to the
  electric grid. Ballistic microbes, quickly setting microbial agents that may be
  associated with insect debris, were sampled by placing petri dishes containing
  nonselective nutrient agar beneath the traps and monitoring microbial growth.
  Microbial aerosols, air suspended microbes, were monitored using an Andersen,
  six-stage, microbial particle sizing sampler. In both the ballistic microbe and
  microbial aerosol experiments, the four high voltage light traps generated
  higher numbers of microbial agents than the low voltage light trap.

AB: Seasonal variations in metal concentrations in soft tissues of marine
  mussels can be due, to a great extent, to seasonal changes in flesh weight.
  Consequently, this event results in an unpredictable overestimation of metal
  bioavailability when the metal concentration in soft tissues is considered as
  an index of such metal bioavailability. The Abra estuary (Bizkaia, Bay of
  Biscay, Spain) was used as a natural experimental basin with well-known
  differences in the levels of metallic pollutants. The level of metal
  bioavailability was determined at various sites at different times of the year.
  For this purpose the conventional approach of recording metal concentrations in
  soft tissues and the approach based on the calculation of metal/shell-weight
  indices were applied. We concluded that seasonal changes in organism condition
  (Flesh Condition Index) cause unpredictable oscillations in the metal
  concentration in soft tissues. For this reason the direct use of metal
  concentration values is not recommended to assess metal bioavailability. The
  metal/shell-weight indices, however, were not affected by seasonal changes in
  the flesh weight of sentinel mussels and thus may provide a more realistic
  indication of metal bioavailability. In the present study, different metal
  bioavailabilities, assessed by metal/shell-weight indices, were found at
  different sampling sites, according to the influence of industrial activities.
  Seasonal trends in metal/shell-weight indices (attributed to different metal
  inputs at different times) were also recorded. In conclusion, metal/shell
  -weight indices, characterized by a high sensitivity and a low noise-to-signal
  ratio, are a simple and reliable tool for assessing metal bioavailability in
  'Mussel Watch' monitoring programmes.

AB: The employer is expected to maintain responsibility for health care expenses
  and lost income that result from occupational injury and illness through the
  workers' compensation insurance system. However, financial support for
  individuals with occupational illnesses, especially those with long latency, is
  often from sources other than workers' compensation. Silicosis, a well defined,
  chronic, occupational lung disease, can be viewed as a sentinel for the
  inadequacy of the public policy to compensate workers for chronic occupational
  lung disease. Three hundred twenty-nine patients with confirmed silicosis were
  identified by the silicosis surveillance program in the New Jersey Department
  of Health using source data from 1979 through 1992. One hundred seventy-seven
  of these individuals provided information on the status of any compensation
  claims against their employer. Only 31% of these patients stated that a claim
  had been filed; 84% of those whose claims were settled were awarded payments.
  Severity of radiologic findings was not associated with the likelihood of
  filing a claim or with being awarded a payment; whereas, smoking was associated
  with these outcomes. The implications of these findings for the health care
  system are discussed.

AB: Mytilus edulis and related species have been used as sentinel organisms to
  monitor marine pollutants. Monitoring studies have reported data for TBT in
  mussels from various locations. Chemical analysis of mussels provides a time
  -averaged measure of bioavailable TBT in the ambient water and can give a more
  representative view of TBT exposure than periodic water sampling and analysis.
  The present study was undertaken to measure the long-term changes in overall
  TBT inputs into the Tamar Estuary, using a population of M. edulis as an
  indicator of average ambient TBT concentrations in the water column.

AB: Seasonal variations in metal concentrations in soft tissues of marine
  mussels can be due, to a great extent, to seasonal changes in flesh weight.
  Consequently, this event results in an unpredictable overestimation of metal
  bioavailability when the metal concentration in soft tissues is considered as
  an index of such metal bioavailability. The Abra estuary (Bizkaia, Bay of
  Biscay, Spain) was used as a natural experimental basin with well-known
  differences in the levels of metallic pollutants. The level of metal
  bioavailability was determined at various sites at different times of the year.
  For this purpose the conventional approach of recording metal concentrations in
  soft tissues and the approach based on the calculation of metal/shell-weight
  indices, first proposed by Fischer (1983), were applied. We concluded that
  seasonal changes in organism condition (Flesh Condition Index) cause
  unpredictable oscillations in the metal concentration in soft tissues. For this
  reason the direct use of metal concentration values is not recommended to
  assess metal bioavailability. The metal/shell-weight indices, however, were not
  affected by seasonal changes in the flesh weight of sentinel mussels and thus
  may provide a more realistic indication of metal bioavailability. In the
  present study, different metal bioavailabilities, assessed by metal/shell
  -weight indices, were found at different sampling sites, according to the
  influence of industrial activities. Seasonal trends in metal/shell-weight
  indices (attributed to different metal inputs at different times) were also
  recorded. In conclusion, metal/shell-weight indices, characterized by a high
  sensitivity and a low noise-to-signal ratio, are a simple and reliable tool for
  assessing metal bioavailability in 'Mussel Watch' monitoring programmes.

AB: We used flow cytometry (FCM) to conduct a multiple-tissue assay on slider
  turtles (Trachemys scripta) inhabiting radioactive seepage basins. Duplicate
  samples of blood, heart, spleen and kidney were analysed on two different
  cytometers (Leitz MPV and Coulter Profile II), each employing distinct staining
  protocols (DAPI and PI, respectively). Both DAPI and PI assays of spleen cells
  demonstrated significantly greater variation in DNA content for the basin
  turtles than for 'control' animals from nearby, uncontaminated sites. Basin
  turtles also exhibited significant cell-cycle effects for blood and spleen,
  again revealed by both assays. These corroborative findings demonstrate the
  consistency and repeatability of FCM assays in environmental monitoring and
  identify the particularly sensitive nature of turtle blood and spleen to
  mutagenic agents. Our survey complements previous FCM studies on sliders from
  contaminated sites and thereby underscores the species' potential as a sentinel
  for biomarker assays.

AB: Field studies were conducted along an urban/industrial river to investigate
  the potential relationship between anthropogenic contaminants, including those
  related to oil refining, and fish health. The channel catfish, Ictalurus
  punctatus, served as the benthic sentinel species for these studies. At least
  15 aromatic hydrocarbons known to be associated with oil refining and/or other
  industrial activities were detected at impacted stations including known
  carcinogens and mutagens [e.g., anthracene and benzo(a)pyrene]. At an
  appropriate reference station, no anthropogenic contaminants were identified in
  the waters and only 2 were observed in the sediments. Catfish collected from
  the reference station were significantly heavier, longer, and had higher
  relative weights. Morphological deformities such as clubbed, split, and missing
  barbels were observed on 37.8% of the fish collected from the impacted
  stations, while none were observed on fish from the reference station. Livers
  of catfish collected from the impacted stations exhibited a variety of
  histological changes consistent with contaminant exposure including vacuolated
  hepatocytes, pigment deposits, and other hepatoxic changes. These sublethal
  changes appear to be associated with chemical contamination and represent
  compromised health of individual organisms and, potentially, populations.

AB: Identifying toxic effects of new xenobiotics in man is a continuing
  challenge for toxicologists and health specialists. Recording potential cases
  in appropriate databases is the first stage, but these databases should be
  regularly checked in order to generate accurate warning signals which may be
  difficult without automatic and systematic procedures. Various methods can be
  used for this purpose, four of them are discussed in this paper, when applied
  to a virtual database on the immunotoxic effects of xenobiotics. They can be
  used to detect either new recorded associations between xenobiotics and a given
  toxic effect, or variations in the acceptable occurrence rate of a known
  association. For the purpose of identifying the immunotoxicity of xenobiotics
  as well as any other toxicity, association between complementary methods could
  be helpful when analysing appropriate database, and provide efficient
  procedures.

AB: Since 1971, the herring gull (Larus argentatus) has been used as a sentinel
  species for monitoring the levels of persistent contaminants in the Great Lakes
  ecosystem. In this study, 21 herring gull colonies in the Great Lakes and
  connecting channels were sampled for years 1972-1976, 1981-1983, 1985, and
  1992. For each year, 10 eggs (usually) were collected from each colony site and
  analyzed for total mercury (ppm wet weight). Results indicated that eggs from
  Lake Ontario displayed the highest mercury levels (0.28 plus or minus 0.08 to
  0.73 plus or minus 0.23) (mean plus or minus s.d), followed by Lake Superior
  (0.21 plus or minus 0.06 to 0.48 plus or minus 0.07). Lake Erie typically
  displayed the lowest egg mercury levels (0.18 plus or minus 0.08 to 0.24 plus
  or minus 0.11). Overall, mercury levels ranged from 0.12 plus or minus 0.02 in
  1985 to 0.88 plus or minus 0.23 in 1982 for Channel/Shelter Island (Lake Huron)
  and Pigeon Island (Lake Ontario) respectively. Generally, all colony sites
  showed peak egg mercury levels in 1982. A significant decline in egg mercury
  levels was observed in six colony sites between 1972 and 1992 and in three
  colony sites between 1981 and 1992. The mean herring gull egg mercury levels
  observed in the early and mid 1970s and in 1982 for some colony sites were
  within the range found which potentially reduces hatchability in other fish
  -eating bird species.

AB: The database of the National Animal Poison Control Center (NAPCC) was
  evaluated as a source for animal poison data indicating human health hazards in
  indoor and outdoor environments. From 14,150 calls in the 1985 database, 259
  cases were identified with histories suggesting human exposure. A subgroup of
  25 cases with known human exposure was found. Dogs were the most common
  sentinel animal, but bird cases represented the highest proportional selection
  from the total 1985 call list. Indoor exposures represented 43.2% of cases; the
  most common toxicants were insecticides, lead and toxic fumes. Exposures
  associated with lawns were mainly due to insecticides and herbicides and
  constituted 25.5% of cases. Other outdoor exposures composed the remaining
  31.7% of cases, with insecticides, herbicides and unidentified toxins the
  leading categories. Many of the specific agents identified, such as
  organophosphate insecticides, lead, gas and fume toxins, and phenoxy herbicides
  are also risk factors in human diseases. This study indicates that databases
  such as NAPCC could serve as sources of sentinel animal intoxications for
  followup studies to evaluate known and potential human health hazards.

  thresholds in 42% (p < .001) of roofers' dominant toes and in 36% (p < .001) of
  roofers' nondominant toes; fewer roofers had abnormal sensory physical
  examinations or reported neuritic symptoms. Roofing workers may be at increased
  risk of peripheral neuropathy, perhaps resulting from exposure to solvents-
  -particularly n-hexane, associated with one-ply roofing systems.

AB: The white sucker, Catostomus commersoni (Lacapede), has been proposed as a
  sentinel species to monitor environmental health in the Great Lakes. In a
  population of white suckers spawning in the Ganaraska River, Lake Ontario (Port
  Hope, Ontario) there was an elevated prevalence of lip papillomas (46%), body
  papillomas (1.4%), and mucoid plaques (47%) compared to an inland reference
  population from the Squaw River, Little Bald Lake, Ontario (5%, 0%, and 0.5%,
  respectively). Multiple lip papillomas, and papillomas in apposition were
  prevalent in Ganaraska River suckers (17%) but rare in Squaw River suckers
  (1.2%). The prevalence of lip papillomas was not related to age or size, but
  papillomas at the Ganaraska site were up to 10 times larger than papillomas at
  the Squaw site. Relative papilloma prevalences at the two sites were correlated
  with relative concentrations of persistent contaminants (PCBs and OC compounds)
  in fish tissue. Histologically, lip and body papillomas were classified as
  benign hyperplasia and could be differentiated from normal tissue and mucoid
  plaques on the basis of biochemical (Protein Kinase C) activity. In laboratory
  experiments, mucoid plaques disappeared completely within 96 hours of
  antibiotic treatments (100% of treated suckers vs. 15% of untreated controls)
  and re-infection was not observed. These experiments indicate that mucoid
  plaques are not true neoplasms.

AB: The purpose of this study was to assess the oncogenic potential of vinyl
  fluoride in rats and mice when administered by inhalation. Male and female rats
  and mice were exposed to 0, 25, 250, or 2500 ppm vinyl fluoride 6 hr per day, 5
  days per week, for 2 years (rats) or 18 months (mice). Slight body weight gain
  decrements were noted in groups of vinyl fluoride-exposed rats and mice. No
  significant clinical signs of toxicity were noted other than an increase in the
  incidence of palpable masses in the region of the mammary gland in female mice
  exposed to vinyl fluoride. Survival was decreased in male rats and mice of the
  250 and 2500 ppm groups and female rats and mice of all vinyl fluoride-exposed
  groups compared to controls. Urinary fluoride excretion, an indicator of vinyl
  fluoride metabolism, increased with concentration and time although the dose
  relationship appeared to plateau at concentrations greater than or equal to 250
  ppm. Gross observations made at necropsy of rats supported histological
  observations of hepatic hemangiosarcoma, hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma,
  hepatic foci of clear cell and basophilic alteration, hepatic sinusoidal
  dilatation, metastatic lung tumors, and Zymbal's gland tumors. Hepatic
  hemangiosarcoma was the sentinel lesion in rats. Gross observations made at
  necropsy of mice supported histological observations of bronchioloalveolar
  adenoma and hyperplasia, hepatic hemangiosarcoma and hepatocellular hyperplasia
  with angiectasis and peliosis, and mammary gland adenocarcinoma and
  hyperplasia. Bronchioloalveolar adenoma appeared to be the sentinel lesion in
  mice. The spectrum of vinyl fluoride-induced tumors is similar to that induced
  by other monohaloethylenes in rats and mice. Under the conditions of this
  study, vinyl fluoride was carcinogenic in male and female rats and mice at
  concentrations greater than or equal to 25 ppm.

AB: Individual PCBs and chlorinated pesticides (CHLPs) were determined in water,
  suspended particles (SPM), sediments, and Asiatic clams to study their
  bioaccumulation kinetics and evaluate the usefulness of the clams as sentinel
  organisms. Bioaccumulation depended on the routes of uptake and bioavailability
  determined by compound hydrophobicity. Corbicula fluminea are reliable sentinel
  organisms and showed clear geographical trends along 150 km of the Rio de La
  Plata coast: a progressive decrease of PCB levels and more degraded patterns
  dominated by recalcitrant congeners, i.e., 153, were observed with increasing
  distance from the major La Plata-Buenos Aires urban center. A size-related
  trend overlapped with this spatial gradient: older clams usually showed higher
  levels and a more degraded PCB signature. CHLPs showed less clear geographical
  trends due to the presence of multiple sources. CHLP patterns showed a strong
  dominance of chlordane-related compounds, particularly trans-chlordane which
  was 2-5 times more abundant than the cis isomer. On a temporal scale, from 1986
  to 1993, Asiatic clams presented sustained PCB levels but showed a significant
  decrease of chlordane and DDT, which suggests reduced inputs in recent years.

AB: Oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau) are a resident part of the estuarine benthic
  food web from the New England States to Florida in the U.S.A. They are a
  sentinel species with the potential to extract toxic environmental trace
  metals. To test this hypothesis, we are studying toadfish resident in the
  Chesapeake Bay near Annapolis, Maryland, U.S.A. This area is away from any
  direct industrial or commercial effluents carrying trace metals but has
  concentrations of trace metals in the benthic sediments. Since the toadfish is
  a resident, non-migratory benthic predator, we feel it is useful in studying
  trace metal contamination and eventually modeling metal movements in a
  biological system. Historical information indicates that the dredging patterns
  associated with the Baltimore, Maryland, Harbor are a potential source of trace
  metal contamination. This study concentrates on trace metals found in the
  physiologically important organ, the liver. Our study uses a proton induced x
  -ray emissions (PIXE) system to analyze for the trace metals. The PIXE system
  allows us arapid method to determine trace metal types, concentrations and an
  archiving method for samples. Present analyses of various size toadfish show
  that the livers contained concentrations of chromium (5.9-51.7 mg/L), copper
  (3.3-26.0 mg/L), and zinc (8.6-29.9) mg/L). The trace metal amounts vary as a
  function of the size, age, and sex of the fish. Copper and chromium
  concentrations deplete with age after the reproductive phase, while zinc
  concentrations increase. Generally, the trace metals have an accumulation
  pattern of chromium>zinc>copper that is different from the zinc>copper>chromium
  in the sediments of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States. Thus the
  life history of the animal appears as an important factor in trace metal
  accumulation. This leads to postulating a conceptual model for trace metal flow
  through this biological system. Although establishing that trace metal
  concentrations appear linked to the life history stage of the toadfish, we plan
  further work on the impact as well as protective mechanisms.

  child-care settings. We propose a framework for developing public health
  surveillance systems that uses sentinel child-care sites, notifiable disease
  surveillance, modification of existing surveillance systems, and population
  surveys. Successful surveillance in these settings depends on the active
  participation of child-care providers, public health practitioners, and
  clinicians in (a) the selection of high priority diseases and injuries for
  surveillance; (b) the development of practical case definitions; (c) the
  augmentation of current surveillance systems to include disease and injury
  related to child care; and (d) the implementation, assessment, dissemination,
  and evaluation of new approaches for surveillance in child-care settings.

AB: 2,3-Dibromo-1-propanol is a metabolite of the flame retardant tris(2,3
  -dibromopropyl) phosphate, previously shown to be a mutagen and carcinogen in
  experimental animals. Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of 2,3-dibromo-1
  -propanol were conducted by applying the chemical in 95% ethanol to the
  interscapular skin of male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F sub(1) mice 5 days
  a week for 13 weeks in the prechronic study and 48-55 weeks (rats) or 36-42
  weeks (mice) in the carcinogenicity study. In the 13-week study, 10 rats and 10
  mice of each sex received doses of 0, 44, 88, 177, 375, or 750 mg/kg. Deaths
  associated with chemical application occurred only in the high-dose (750 mg/kg)
  male mice. Chemical-related lesions were seen in the kidney of male rats, liver
  of female rats, and liver and lung of both sexes of mice. Based on the toxicity
  observed in the 13-week study, 50 rats of each sex received doses of 0, 188, or
  375 mg/kg and 50 mice of each sex received 0, 88, or 177 mg/kg in the
  carcinogenicity study. The planned 2-year study was terminated early because of
  reduced survival of rats related to chemical-induced neoplasia and because of
  the appearance of antibodies to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus in sentinel
  mice. Nearly all dosed rats had malignant neoplasms at one or more sites, while
  only one control male and one control female had malignant neoplasms. In rats,
  neoplasms induced by 2,3-dibromo-1-propanol occurred in the skin, nasal mucosa,
  Zymbal's gland, oral mucosa, esophagus, forestomach, intestines, liver, kidney,
  mammary gland (females), clitoral gland (females), spleen (males), and
  mesothelium (males). In mice, chemical-induced neoplasms occurred in the skin,
  forestomach, liver (males), and lung (males).

AB: Dispersal of the Old World screw-worm fly, Chrysomya bezziana Villeneuve,
  was studied in Papua New Guinea by releasing radio-isotope labelled, laboratory
  -reared flies and collecting their labelled egg masses from sentinel cattle. A
  log-linear model was developed to describe recapture rate. Distance was found
  to dominate the model and was represented by a bilinear ('broken-stick') term
  as log-distance. Further terms in the model such as attractiveness of the site
  (estimated from the number of non-labelled egg masses), the season of the year
  and a time trend were statistically significant but of minor importance. From
  the model, the median distance females dispersed before depositing an egg mass
  was 10.8 km. The maximum distance from the release site that egg masses were
  recovered was 100 km. The dispersal ability of C. bezziana is discussed in
  terms of its impact on the prospects of eradicating this species using SIRM if
  an outbreak occurred in Australia.

  exposure, ocular examinations on representative animal populations were
  performed, and the ambient UV-B exposure in the region during the time of
  maximal thinning was estimated. No increase in patient visits or conditions
  attributable to UV-B exposure was seen for periods of known ozone depletion
  compared with control periods. Although ambient UV-B exposure was 1.6 to 2.3
  times the habitual exposure on individual days, this excess exposure conferred
  only a 1% increase in annual exposure on the region. This study does not
  support existing lay reports of ocular and dermatologic disease in humans and
  animals that had been associated with the ozone hole over southern Chile.

AB: The federal country of Carinthia is known for its lakes and ponds, which are
  extensively used for bathing. The water quality is monitored regularly in
  accordance to the EC-Directive 76/160/EC and especially to the more rigorous
  Austrian Standard M6230. Since redevelopment measures of the lakes have been
  nearly finished the water quality found has improved essentially. In spite of
  these monitored data no effective correlation to data from the concerning
  ambulant sector of medical care could be established. The Carinthian Sentinel
  Practice Network started in summer 1994 to retrieve informations about
  occurrence and frequency of bathing related illness of children up to 16 years
  old. The 26 participating primary health care and pediatric physicians, having
  their own independent practices spread all over the country, reported the
  specific doctor-patient-contracts to the coordinating base. Criteria for
  inclusion in the medical report were headache, sore throat, otalgia, stomach
  -ache, nausea, emesis, diarrhoea, fever, rhinitis, cough, cold, moreover
  conjunctivitis, skin rash and specific dermatitis. In addition physicians
  reported where, how long and how often the children had been bathing and how
  long they had been free of symptoms afterwards. Each case was reported to the
  coordinating base including a presumed diagnosis. Statistic evaluation showed
  that bathing related illness may be divided into three main groups according to
  symptom frequency. The frequency of otalgia (32.4%) was significantly higher
  than any other symptom asked for. Two groups of symptoms correlate with each
  other: on one hand rhinitis, conjunctivitis, cough and sore throat (36.5%) and
  on the other hand nausea, emesis, diarrhoea and fever (41.9%). These data
  underline conclusions drawn by other authors but are not representative enough
  to correlate to data from water monitoring. First results suggest that
  conclusions for public health authorities can be drawn from this additional
  information about the state of the lakes and ponds-providing a sufficient
  number of data is reported.

AB: Sun exposure has now been established as the most important avoidable cause
  of nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) and melanoma. With specific reference to
  melanoma, there are several key issues that remain to be resolved. These
  include definition of the action spectrum, the importance of systemic effects
  of sun exposure, whether a tan is protective, the risk of tanning booth
  exposures, and the efficacy of sunscreens. Also the role, if any, of sun
  exposure in noncutaneous malignancies remains to be established. Melanoma
  incidence and mortality have increased dramatically over the past several
  decades, but these increases have now slowed, and for mortality among those 15
  to 45 years of age, decreasing rates are now observed. Improving the coverage
  of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries by
  requiring pathology laboratories in non-SEER areas to report cancers among SEER
  area residents will allow correct interpretation of these trends in the future
  at minimal cost. The available data on trends in NMSC incidence and mortality
  are suboptimal but suggest a pattern of declining mortality despite increasing
  incidence. Trends in NMSC morbidity have not been defined. Establishing NMSC
  registries in a few diverse sentinel areas would allow more reliable inference
  and monitoring. Techniques are being developed for reducing sun exposures and
  increasing early detection of skin cancers in the general population, but
  improved monitoring of incidence, mortality, and morbidity is required to
  monitor the effects of current and future ozone depletion and to evaluate
  prevention and early detection measures.

AB: The employer is expected to maintain responsibility for health care expenses
  and lost income that result from occupational injury and illness through the
  workers' compensation insurance system. However, financial support for
  individuals with occupational illnesses, especially those with long latency, is
  often from sources other than workers' compensation. Silicosis, a well defined,
  chronic, occupational lung disease, can be viewed as a sentinel for the
  inadequacy of the public policy to compensate workers for chronic occupational
  lung disease. Three hundred twenty-nine patients with confirmed silicosis were
  identified by the silicosis surveillance program in the New Jersey Department
  of Health using source data from 1979 through 1992. One hundred seventy-seven
  of these individuals provided information on the status of any compensation
  claims against their employer. Only 31% of these patients stated that a claim
  had been filed; 84% of those whose claims were settled were awarded payments.
  Severity of radiologic findings was not associated with the likelihood of
  filing a claim or with being awarded a payment; whereas, smoking was associated
  with these outcomes. The implications of these findings for the health care
  system are discussed.

  Council Mortality provides appropRiate information about occupational diseases.
  Limitations of the occupational data in the Andalucian Mortality Registries
  make it impossible to find the majority of potential occupational diseases, and
  occupation data were even worse during the second period of study (1980-85).

AB: In the public's view, chemical residues still dominate in the ranking of
  foodborne hazards. This perception is changing slowly as a result of public
  discussions on the dangers to human beings from various microorganisms in
  foodstuff. Statistics on foodborne infections and intoxications comprising
  acute diseases have shown that chemical substances (including fungal toxins)
  play a less significant role than bacteria. A sentinel and a populations study
  from Holland provides information on the incidence of cases of acute
  gastroenteritis caused by microorganisms in foods. The results of this study
  show that 100 to 150 cases are to be expected annually per 1000 inhabitants. An
  economic cost of about $1000 per case of disease is calculated in Canada and
  the USA. On the basis of these figures and the Dutch study, the estimated
  annual economic impact is more than 10 billion DM for the Federal Republic of
  Germany. The difficulties in quantification of microbiological hazards from
  foodstuffs on the base of dose-response relation and exposure assessment such
  as are usual in the risk assessment of chemical hazards are discussed. A safety
  concept of the food industry (the HACCP concept) is then described. This
  comprises hazard identification. risk assessment as well as risk management.
  This concept is also applicable in other food areas such as communal catering.
  In the meantime, it has also been taken into consideration in European food
  legislation.

AB: Patients who undergo sentinel events indicate a breakdown in the chain of
  prevention and protection. Because most work- or environmentally induced
  illnesses and disabilities produce nonspecific or late symptoms and signs, the
  search for exposures to physical, toxic, ergonomic, or sociopsychological
  events that induce these sentinel events has to be based on systematic
  investigative routine, and not on the physician's mere awareness. Routine use
  of five "trigger" questions to identify jobs, tasks, exposures, symptoms, and
  other persons at risk can be effective, quick, and inexpensive in the search
  for preventable illness related to work or environment in the sentinel patient,
  especially when illness persists, recurs, or progresses or occurs in others.
  Sometimes, others can be helped when it is too late to do anything for the
  sentinel individual. This holds true for the relatively simple situations of
  one exposure and one outcome and for settings in which there are many exposures
  or many diseases in one or many patients. The newer set of "clean" environments
  that include ergonomic and sociopsychological hazards and stress at the work
  -station have produced new sentinel events. Knowledge of the impact of macro
  -environmental hazards presupposes familiarity with their impact on individual
  risks. Using the sentinel event to promote prevention of hazardous exposures
  means opportunities for reducing unnecessary risk in individuals and small
  groups. Opportunities for prevention arise when sentinel events occur at the
  time of exposure. Where there is latency between exposure and outcome, an
  anticipatory approach based on awareness of future risks from preventable
  current exposures is needed. The search for external exposures that have
  already occurred and for those that are preventable should be a routine part of
  internal medicine.

AB: BACKGROUND--Asthma outbreaks have not been detected in Barcelona, Spain
  since the epidemic of 1981-7. On 29 October 1994 several subjects attended a
  Barcelona hospital because of acute attacks of asthma and were identified as
  former soybean epidemic asthma patients (repeaters), raising the possibility of
  an asthma soybean-related episode. The usefulness of counting repeaters to
  evaluate small increases of acute asthma in a non-epidemic period is
  illustrated. METHODS--A retrospective identification of asthma admissions was
  performed, pollution filters collected before and after the index day were
  analysed for contents of low molecular weight soybean allergen, and soybean
  unloading activities were investigated. RESULTS--There was no epidemic increase
  of asthma patients during this day in the whole of Barcelona, but an unusually
  high number were repeaters (seven observed v 0.483 expected). A relationship
  with increased levels of low molecular weight soybean allergen (U/m3) was
  detected in the available pollution filters collected the day before and after
  the index day. Two ships were unloading soybean in the city harbour on the
  index day. CONCLUSION--Soybean unloading at the harbour of Barcelona released
  soybean dust and produced a small cluster of emergency room visits for asthma
  in patients formerly affected by soybean asthma epidemics. It is suggested that
  counting repeaters could provide the basis for a systematic epidemiological
  surveillance of sensitised populations.

AB: The purpose of this study was to assess the oncogenic potential of vinyl
  fluoride in rats and mice when administered by inhalation. Male and female rats
  and mice were exposed to 0, 25, 250, or 2500 ppm vinyl fluoride 6 hr per day, 5
  days per week, for 2 years (rats) or 18 months (mice). Slight body weight gain
  decrements were noted in groups of vinyl fluoride-exposed rats and mice. No
  significant clinical signs of toxicity were noted other than an increase in the
  incidence of palpable masses in the region of the mammary gland in female mice
  exposed to vinyl fluoride. Survival was decreased in male rats and mice of the
  250 and 2500 ppm groups and female rats and mice of all vinyl fluoride-exposed
  groups compared to controls. Urinary fluoride excretion, an indicator of vinyl
  fluoride metabolism, increased with concentration and time although the dose
  relationship appeared to plateau at concentrations > or = 250 ppm. Gross
  observations made at necropsy of rats supported histological observations of
  hepatic hemangiosarcoma, hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma, hepatic foci of
  clear cell and basophilic alteration, hepatic sinusoidal dilatation, metastatic
  lung tumors, and Zymbal's gland tumors. Hepatic hemangiosarcoma was the
  sentinel lesion in rats. Gross observations made at necropsy of mice supported
  histological observations of bronchioloalveolar adenoma and hyperplasia,
  hepatic hemangiosarcoma and hepatocellular hyperplasia with angiectasis and
  peliosis, and mammary gland adenocarcinoma and hyperplasia. Bronchioloalveolar
  adenoma appeared to be the sentinel lesion in mice. The spectrum of vinyl
  fluoride-induced tumors is similar to that induced by other monohaloethylenes
  in rats and mice. Under the conditions of this study, vinyl fluoride was
  carcinogenic in male and female rats and mice at concentrations greater than or
  equal to 25 ppm.

AB: OBJECTIVES. This case-control study examined the association between syringe
  exchange use and hepatitis B and C in injection drug users. METHODS. Case
  patients included 28 injection drug users with acute hepatitis B and 20 with
  acute hepatitis C reported to the health department in a sentinel hepatitis
  surveillance county; control subjects were injection drug users with no markers
  of exposure to hepatitis B or C (n = 38 and 26, respectively) attending health
  department services during the same period. Data were abstracted from clinic
  records. RESULTS. Seventy-five percent of case patients with hepatitis B and
  26% of control subjects had never used the exchange; similar proportions were
  found for the hepatitis C case and control groups. After adjustment for
  demographic characteristics and duration of injecting drugs, nonuse of the
  exchange was associated with a sixfold greater risk of hepatitis B (odds ratio
  [OR] = 5.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.5, 20.4) and a sevenfold greater
  risk of hepatitis C (OR = 7.3; 95% CI = 1.6, 32.8). CONCLUSIONS. The results
  suggest that use of the exchange led to a significant reduction in hepatitis B
  and hepatitis C in the county and may have also prevented a substantial
  proportion of human immunodeficiency virus infections in injection drug users.

AB: In the area of health, the information system used by the authorities is
  based on a series of networks that need to be coordinated. 1. State
  information: State information as regards health epidemiology was for a long
  time fragmented. The reasons for this relative ignorance are varied, and are
  based both on professional and technical factors (preference of physicians for
  personal exchange rather than for statistical analysis, difficulties in data
  collection and mathematical processing), and on socio-political factors (the
  euphoria of years of economic growth). For a long time only the causes of death
  were appropriately documented (cf. Mme Facy's report). In the last decade, a
  variety of initiatives has been directed towards all fields, and morbidity is
  becoming better defined thanks to the ORS (Regional Health Observatories) (cf.
  M. Garro's speech) and health registers (cf. M. Schaffer). Warning systems are
  becoming a principal preoccupation for most people in positions of authority,
  and explain the proliferation of surveillance networks. 2. Sentinel networks: A
  'sentinel network' is an interactive surveillance system involving the
  collection of health data on a routine basis by a group of doctors (general
  physicians, biologists, etc.). Initially conceived for the surveillance of
  communicable diseases, they are also used for all diseases requiring early
  warning and rapid intervention (effects of sudden pollution, surveillance of
  drugs and poisons, etc.). These sentinel networks have expanded in our
  countries to complement the compulsory notification systems for infectious
  diseases, whose 'passive' nature often leads to under-notification (and
  therefore a non-representative selection) and delayed notification of cases,
  and whose range of influence does not cover all communicable diseases.(ABSTRACT

AB: STUDY OBJECTIVE--The study aimed to assess through a sentinel practice
  network the validity of data on levels of organochlorine residues in human milk
  along with personal, lifestyle, and exposure variables of breastfeeding women;
  to compare the results of this new approach with those of the Lower Saxony
  breast milk surveillance programme; and to test hypotheses on potential
  determinants of contamination levels. DESIGN--Eligible women were enrolled into
  this cross sectional study by a network of 51 paediatric practices when
  bringing their babies for a U3 infant screening examination (4th to 6th week
  after delivery). Lifestyle and exposure factors were obtained by questionnaire.
  All milk samples were analysed for hexachlorocyclohexane, hexachlorbenzole,
  DDT, dieldrin, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and heptachlor; half the samples
  were also analysed for dioxin. Analytic statistics were computed using
  polychotomous logistic regression (PLR). SETTING--The study was conducted in
  Lower Saxony, Germany, from summer 1992 to summer 1993. PARTICIPANTS-
  -Altogether 156 primiparous, breast feeding German women, aged 25-35 years, who
  had been born and had grown up in West Germany, were studied. MAIN RESULTS-
  -Compared with the regular programme, participants in this study had their milk
  analysed sooner after delivery and were more likely to have grown up in rural
  areas, less likely to have been exposed to hazardous substances, less likely to
  have a diet of health food, and slightly less likely to be a smoker at the time
  of the study. Breast milk contamination levels were comparable in both studies,
  and in all but two cases well below the tolerable concentrations established by
  the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Fellowship). After
  adjustment for potential confounders using polychotomous logistic regression,
  there were statistically significant positive associations between breast milk
  contamination and age (PCB, test for trend: p = 0.006), average dietary fat
  intake per week (dioxin, p = 0.01), and proximity of residence to hazardous
  sites (dioxin, p

AB: 2,3-Dibromo-1-propanol is a metabolite of the flame retardant tris(2,3
  -dibromopropyl) phosphate, previously shown to be a mutagen and carcinogen in
  experimental animals. Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of 2,3-dibromo-1
  -propanol were conducted by applying the chemical in 95% ethanol to the
  interscapular skin of male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice 5 days a week
  for 13 weeks in the prechronic study and 48-55 weeks (rats) or 36-42 weeks
  (mice) in the carcinogenicity study. In the 13-week study, 10 rats and 10 mice
  of each sex received doses of 0, 44, 88, 177, 375, or 750 mg/kg. Deaths
  associated with chemical application occurred only in the high-dose (750 mg/kg)
  male mice. Chemical-related lesions were seen in the kidney of male rats, liver
  of female rats, and liver and lung of both sexes of mice. Based on the toxicity
  observed in the 13-week study, 50 rats of each sex received doses of 0, 188, or
  375 mg/kg and 50 mice of each sex received 0, 88, or 177 mg/kg in the
  carcinogenicity study. The planned 2-year study was terminated early because of
  reduced survival of rats related to chemical-induced neoplasia and because of
  the appearance of antibodies to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus in sentinel
  mice. Nearly all dosed rats had malignant neoplasms at one or more sites, while
  only one control male and one control female had malignant neoplasms. In rats,
  neoplasms induced by 2,3-dibromo-1-propanol occurred in the skin, nasal mucosa,
  Zymbal's gland, oral mucosa, esophagus, forestomach, intestines, liver, kidney,
  mammary gland (females), clitoral gland (females), spleen (males), and
  mesothelium (males). In mice, chemical-induced neoplasms occurred in the skin,
  forestomach, liver (males), and lung (males).

AB: The database of the National Animal Poison Control Center (NAPCC) was
  evaluated as a source for animal poison data indicating human health hazards in
  indoor and outdoor environments. From 14,150 calls in the 1985 database, 259
  cases were identified with histories suggesting human exposure. A subgroup of
  25 cases with known human exposure was found. Dogs were the most common
  sentinel animal, but bird cases represented the highest proportional selection
  from the total 1985 call list. Indoor exposures represented 43.2% of cases; the
  most common toxicants were insecticides, lead and toxic fumes. Exposures
  associated with lawns were mainly due to insecticides and herbicides and
  constituted 25.5% of cases. Other outdoor exposures composed the remaining
  31.7% of cases, with insecticides, herbicides and unidentified toxins the
  leading categories. Many of the specific agents identified, such as
  organophosphate insecticides, lead, gas and fume toxins, and phenoxy herbicides
  are also risk factors in human diseases. This study indicates that databases
  such as NAPCC could serve as sources of sentinel animal intoxications for
  followup studies to evaluate known and potential human health hazards.

AB: In response to limitations in state-based, occupational disease
  surveillance, the California Department of Health Services developed a model
  for provider- and case-based surveillance of work-related carpal tunnel
  syndrome. The objectives were to enhance case reporting, identify risk factors
  and high-risk work sites, and link preventive interventions to work sites and
  the broader community. Using elements from surveillance of communicable
  diseases and sentinel health events, a model was integrated into the pre
  -existing reporting system in one California county. Between 1989 and 1991, 54
  Santa Clara County health care providers reported 382 suspected cases, of which
  365 from 195 work sites met reporting guidelines. Risk factors were profiled
  from interviews of 135 prioritized cases and 38 employers. Of 24 work sites
  prioritized for a free, voluntary, nonenforcement inspection, 18 refused and 6
  completed an on-site visit. Sentinel Event Notification System for Occupational
  Risks (SENSOR) captured many cases not reported to the pre-existing reporting
  system. Case interviews indicated a profile of symptoms and signs, treatment,
  and exposure to uncontrolled occupational risk factors, including a lack of
  training on ergonomics hazards. Employer health insurance, rather than workers'

AB: OBJECTIVES. In response to limitations in state-based occupational disease
  surveillance, the California Department of Health Services developed a model
  for surveillance of acute, work-related pesticide illness. The objectives were
  to enhance case reporting and link case reports to preventive interventions.
  METHODS. Elements from surveillance of communicable diseases and sentinel
  health events were used to integrate a model into the preexisting system in one
  agricultural country. RESULTS. Between 1988 and 1991, 45 Fresno County health
  care providers reported 230 suspected cases, of which 217 from 80 work sites
  met reporting guidelines. Risk factors were profiled from interviews of 81
  prioritized case patients and 36 employers. Fifteen work sites were visited and
  117 recommendations were made, of which 6% were identified in enforcement
  inspections. Pest management experts consulted with growers on reducing future
  pesticide use. CONCLUSIONS. Risk factors for pesticide illness were prevalent.
  Agricultural inspectors did not detect routine and serious hazards. Integrated
  pest management should be expanded and linked to occupational health.
  Agricultural enforcement personnel should be oriented and trained in
  occupational safety and health.

AB: This study uses the National Mortality Followback Survey of 1986 to identify
  the top five Sentinel Health Events Occupational [SHE(O)s], the five leading
  causes of death, and to ascertain the primary occupations and industries
  associated with these. We found that, as expected, cardiovascular diseases were
  four of the five leading causes of death overall. In addition, the SHE(O)
  responsible for most deaths was cancer of the trachea, bronchus, and lung,
  followed by renal failure, bladder cancer, myeloid leukemia, and liver cancer.
  We employed proportionate mortality ratios to analyze the relationship between
  industry and occupation and category of mortality. In brief, we validated
  findings by other researchers; for example, farmers were at lower risk of
  cancer of the trachea, bronchus, and lung, and workers in eating/drinking
  places had excess risk of liver cancer. We also hypothesize other
  relationships, such as between motor vehicle dealers and bladder cancer.

AB: OBJECTIVES. This study sought to investigate numerous reports emanating from
  Punta Arenas, Chile (population 110,000, latitude 53 degrees S), that
  associated acute ocular and dermatologic disease in humans and animals with
  excess ultraviolet-B (UV-B) exposure in the setting of the thinning of the
  ozone column. METHODS. Ophthalmologic and dermatologic records in Punta Arenas
  were systematically reviewed to enumerate sentinel diagnoses potentially
  associated with UV-B exposure, ocular examinations on representative animal
  populations were performed, and the ambient UV-B exposure in the region during
  the time of maximal thinning was estimated. RESULTS. No increase in patient
  visits or conditions attributable to UV-B exposure was seen for periods of
  known ozone depletion compared with control periods. Although ambient UV-B
  exposure was 1.6 to 2.3 times the habitual exposure on individual days, this
  excess exposure conferred only a 1% increase in annual exposure on the region.
  CONCLUSION. This study does not support existing lay reports of ocular and
  dermatologic disease in humans and animals that had been associated with the
  ozone hole over southern Chile.

  CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is
  assessing practical models for implementing state-based surveillance of
  silicosis and linking follow-up intervention activities to surveillance
  reports. From 1989 through 1992, the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) SENSOR
  program identified silicosis cases through reports of Bureau of Workers'
  Compensation (BWC) claims, physician reports, and death certificates. The
  addition in 1993 of hospital discharge reports as an ascertainment source
  resulted in a substantial increase in the number of silicosis case reports
  identified annually (Table 1). This report describes the investigation of a
  case of occupational silicosis in Ohio and summarizes the impact of hospital
  -based reporting on surveillance for silicosis in Ohio during 1993-1994.

AB: Epizootics of skin neoplasms in teleost species have been documented within
  the Great Lakes region over the last decade. The white sucker, Catostomus
  commersoni, has been proposed as a sentinel species to monitor environmental
  health in these systems. The prevalence of skin neoplasia is elevated in white
  suckers and other fish taken from chemically polluted sites or from lake
  regions adjacent to heavy industry. Lip papillomas regress and proliferate
  spontaneously in captive wild suckers. It is important to investigate the
  relevance of these observations to papilloma etiology to determine whether the
  prevalence of this disease is a suitable biomarker for environmental health.
  White suckers were captured in the spring of 1992 and 1993 during annual
  spawning runs (mid to late April) at the Ganaraska River, which discharges into
  Lake Ontario at Port Hope, Ontario. Under crowded laboratory conditions, there
  was either proliferation of existing papillomas or development of new
  papillomas. However, in uncrowded conditions, existing papillomas either
  regressed completely or there was no development of new papillomas. Protein
  Kinase C (PKC), a proposed marker enzyme for hyperplasia and neoplasia, was
  used to determine if regressing and proliferating papillomas could be
  differentiated on the basis of biochemical activity. PKC activity was lower in
  proliferating papillomas, but not significantly different from papillomas
  sampled initially from Ganaraska River suckers. Regressing papilomatous tissue
  displayed a significantly higher level of enzyme activity than either
  proliferating or unchanged papillomas, but the PKC activity of regressing
  papillomas was not significantly different from that of normal lip epidermis.

  Sphaeridiotrema pseudoglobulus at two field locations in southern Quebec and
  southeastern Ontario from mid-August to the end of October, 1989. Sentinels
  acquired infections with both digeneans; however, low levels of metacercariae
  of C. bushiensis precluded any conclusions regarding transmission of this
  parasite from being reached. In contrast, extensive spatial heterogeneity
  existed in the S. pseudoglobulus - snail system. Sentinel snails within 10 m of
  each other were apparently exposed to vastly different levels of naturally
  occurring cercariae. All size classes of sentinels were apparently equally
  susceptible to cercarial infections but no consistent temporal differences in
  infection levels were found.

AB: Burrowing mayflies (Hexagenia sp.) are an important link in the transfer of
  sediment-associated contaminants to food chains in certain aquatic and
  floodplain ecosystems. The burrowing behavior of the mayfly nymphs in fine
  -grained sediments increases their exposure to contaminants, making the mayfly
  a useful sentinel of sediment-associated contaminants. We have studied emergent
  Hexagenia mayflies to assess longitudinal patterns in the bioavailability of
  polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), cadmium, and mercury in a 1,250-km reach of
  the upper Mississippi River. Our results show that analyses of mayflies can
  reveal variation in ecosystem contamination on spatial scales ranging from
  small (<0.5 km) to large (>300 km) and can reveal potential sources of
  contaminants. In the upper Mississippi River, congener-specific analyses of
  Hexagenia also indicate the extent of longitudinal transport of PCBs downstream
  of major source areas. The recent colonization and spread of burrowing mayflies
  in portions of the Great Lakes have provided a benthic sentinel that could be
  used to examine spatial and temporal patterns in the bioavailability of in
  -place contaminants in this ecosystem. To make meaningful comparisons, however,
  our experience indicates that it is necessary to (1) analyze males and females
  separately and (2) use dry-weight values in expressing contaminant
  concentrations. We also recommend protocols for sampling, handling, and
  analysis of emergent mayflies, based on our work with riverine populations of
  H. bilineata.

AB: The white sucker, Catostomus commersoni, has been proposed as a sentinel
  species to monitor environmental health in the Great Lakes. Visible neoplasms
  may provide easily identifiable biomarkers to reflect changes in ecosystem
  health. Papilloma prevalence in white suckers is elevated in contaminated areas
  of the Great Lakes, but these lesions are also relatively common in
  uncontaminated regions. This project is directed at determining the etiology of
  epidermal papillomas in white suckers thus providing specific biomarkers to
  assess environmental health. Our research indicates that many instances of
  observed "spontaneous" regression or development of papillomas in captive wild
  fish are the result of culture conditions. Tumors were successfully transmitted
  into hatchery-raised animals by injecting them with cell-free filtrates
  prepared from lip papillomas. These results give some indication of the primary
  etiological agents responsible for the development of papillomas in white
  suckers. Protein Kinase C (PKC) down-regulation correlates with hyperplasia and
  neoplasia in humans and rodents. In white suckers, low PKC activity indicates a
  proliferative stage of papilloma development and a return to "normal" PKC
  activity signals a regressive stage. Therefore, PKC activity may be a good
  marker enzyme for the stage of papilloma development in wild suckers. This
  research is aimed at evaluating the white sucker as an environmental sentinel.
  It is anticipated that this study will establish whether the induction of white
  sucker papillomas occurs as a result of viral infection, exposure to chemicals,
  or changes in hormonal status, or by interactions between all of these factors.

AB: Between 1982 and 1987, many abnormalities were reported in a Baltic coastal
  fish community exposed to bleached kraft mill effluent. Perch (Perca
  fluviatilis) was selected as a sentinel species. Local recruitment was
  significantly reduced owing to high larval mortality associated with gonad
  malfunctions and low embryo quality. In 1992 the use of chlorine was
  discontinued. A follow-up study on fish showed that many previously documented
  abnormalities were absent, e.g., symptoms of external disease, lower rate of
  sexual maturation, and reduced relative gonad size. The number of species had
  increased, and the fish community resembled a more normal species assemblage.
  However, perch embryos produced in the effluent area remained smaller than
  those in a local reference area and larval survival was low. Consequently,
  although reduced organochlorine waste discharge had resulted in environmental
  improvement, recovery in the perch population was incomplete.

AB: Between 1982 and 1987, many abnormalities were reported in a Baltic coastal
  fish community exposed to bleached kraft mill effluent. Perch (Perca
  fluviatilis) was selected as a sentinel species. Local recruitment was
  significantly reduced owing to high larval mortality associated with gonad
  malfunctions and low embryo quality. Adult abundance was low near the mill
  outfall and the community was poor in species. After 1984, the toxicity of the
  effluent was reduced by substituting chlorine dioxide for molecular chlorine
  which resulted in lower amounts of organochlorine waste, while other effluent
  variables remained relatively unchanged. In 1992 the use of chlorine was
  discontinued. A follow-up study on fish showed that many previously documented
  abnormalities were absent, e.g., symptoms of external disease, lower rate of
  sexual maturation, and reduced relative gonad size. The number of species had
  increased, and the fish community resembled a more normal species assemblage.
  However, perch embryos produced in the effluent area remained smaller than
  those in a local reference area and larval survival was low. Consequently,
  although reduced organochlorine waste discharge had resulted in environmental
  improvement, recovery in the perch population was incomplete.

AB: With a purpose to understand the processes of change in the nature of
  sediment and that in the ecology of the coastal environment, the interaction
  between the marine benthos and sediments in which they thrive has been studied
  in the deltaic Sundarbans (Lat. 21 degree 30'-22 degree 30'N and Long. 88
  degree 31'-91 degree 30'E) of Northeast India. The study revealed that the
  biological activities of benthic animals through burrowing, feeding,
  locomotive, respiratory and excretional processes bring about changes in the
  composition and mass properties of sediments. The present study demonstrates
  the potentiality of these shellfishes as sentinel accumulators of heavy metals
  and they can be successfully used as sensitive index of pollution for future
  environmental assessment of this coastal zone.

AB: We previously proposed a classification scheme to describe the responses of
  fish populations to anthropogenic stress. The original framework separated
  impacted populations into five response patterns, but had several limitations
  and deficiencies, including the subsequent description of additional patterns
  and the absence a pattern reflecting no detectable response of the population.
  The response framework has been reorganized based on new information and
  response patterns described in published literature. The sentinel monitoring
  framework provides a tool for initial interpretation of adult fish surveys and
  description of priority areas for subsequent studies to allow identification of
  the mechanism of impact. Subsequent, focused, follow-up studies are required to
  identify the stressor(s) once the impact mechanism has been identified.
  Response pattern separation requires information from the sampled fish
  population including age structure, energy expenditure and energy storage. The
  patterns represent characteristic responses to changes in food availability,
  adult mortality, recruitment failure and metabolic disruption. The framework
  requires the identification and appropriate sampling of comparable reference
  sites, but the sentinel monitoring framework has proved to be a useful tool in
  preliminary trials, and should provide a focal point for cumulative effects
  studies using fish populations.

AB: Immunotoxic effects include immunosuppression and immunostimulation,
  hypersensitivity and autoimmunity. Infections and lymphoproliferative disorders
  have been associated with the use of immunosuppressive drugs, whereas
  infections have seldom been associated with chemical exposure. Fewer drugs and
  chemicals have been shown to enhance immune parameters. Clinical consequences,
  (i.e. flu-like syndromes, autoimmune reactions, facilitated allergic reactions
  to unrelated antigens and impaired hepatic drug metabolism) mostly have been
  associated with recombinant cytokines. Hypersensitivity reactions have commonly
  been reported in treated patients as well as in exposed workers. Autoimmune
  reactions have been associated with only a few drugs. Overall, current evidence
  suggests that marked immune changes in humans exposed to xenobiotics can result
  in overt clinical toxicities, but it remains to be established to what extent
  mild to moderate immune changes described in animals and/or humans can result
  in immune-mediated diseases. This issue could be investigated by the follow-up
  of selected cohorts, for example patients from clinical trials, exposed
  workers, or inhabitants of heavily polluted areas, using standardized and
  validated immunology assays, together with the identification of sentinel
  immune diseases.

  commersoni, has been proposed as a sentinel species to monitor environmental
  health in these systems. The prevalence of skin neoplasia is elevated in white
  suckers and other fish taken from chemically polluted sites or from lake
  regions adjacent to heavy industry. Lip papillomas regress and proliferate
  spontaneously in captive wild suckers. It is important to investigate the
  relevance of these observations to papilloma etiology to determine whether the
  prevalence of this disease is a suitable biomarker for environmental health.

AB: An 8.1-ha field of 2-wk-old cabbage within an area of general cabbage
  production received a single treatment with 8100 m of a continuous-rope
  formulation of a 70:30 mixture of (Z)-11-hexadecenal and (Z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol
  acetate, two components of the sex pheromone of the female diamondback moth,
  Plutella xylostella (L.). Captures of males in synthetic pheromone-baited
  traps, mating of laboratory-reared sentinel females, and the mated status of
  native moths taken from the plots demonstrated suppression of mating activity
  by the pheromone treatment relative to that in the control area for 9 wk.
  Cabbage in this farm was planted sequentially. Fifteen insecticide treatments
  were applied during production of the block of cabbage, planted 13 d before the
  pheromone-treated cabbage, and 13 applications were made to the adjacent
  (control) block of cabbage planted 3 d after that in the pheromone plot. Two
  insecticide treatments were applied to plants in the pheromone-treated block to
  control diamondback moth larvae resident at the time of the pheromone
  application, and one spray was applied to this block 10 wk later at harvest.
  Cabbage at the extreme perimeter of the pheromone-treated area was damaged
  heavily by diamondback larvae; however, larval and pupal counts throughout most
  of this plot remained comparable to those in the control area. Cabbage at the
  interior of the pheromone area was graded as U.S. no. 1 quality. The results
  indicate that mating disruption can be used to protect cabbage from diamondback
  moth if pheromones are applied to areas of at least 8.1 ha with some
  supplemental application of insecticide.

AB: To assess hepatic lesions as biomarkers of contaminant effects in wild fish,
  relationships between lesions and levels of chemical contaminants in sediments,
  stomach contents, liver, and bile were evaluated in English sole, starry
  flounder, and white croaker as sentinel species from 27 sites on the Pacific
  Coast, and in winter flounder from 22 sites on the Northeast coast of the USA.
  Prevalences of and relative risks for neoplastic, preneoplastic, nonneoplastic
  proliferative, unique degenerative/necrotic lesions, and hydropic vacuolation
  of cholangiocytes and hepatocytes were significantly higher in fish at
  contaminated sites in Puget Sound, the Los Angeles area, and San Francisco and
  San Diego Bays on the Pacific Coast, and in Boston Harbor and Raritan Bay on
  the Northeast Coast. In logistic regression analyses, exposure to polycyclic
  aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), PCBs, DDTs, chlordanes and dieldrin were
  significant risk factors for all lesions in Pacific Coast species. In winter
  flounder, exposure to PAHs, DDTs, or chlordanes were significant risk factors
  only for hydropic vacuolation, nonneoplastic proliferative and nonspecific
  necrotic lesions. Disease risk generally increased with fish age, but sex was
  rarely a risk factor. Although pathologic responses and chemical risk factors
  differed among species, these relationships provide strong evidence for
  environmental contaminants as etiologic agents for hepatic lesions in several
  marine bottomfish species, and clearly indicate the utility of these lesions as
  biomarkers of contaminant-induced effects in wild fish.

AB: The inductive response of the hepatic mixed function oxygenase, CYP1A, of
  fish to polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH's) eg. those in diesel oils, is a well
  validated sub-lethal method for determining the impact of PAH's in the aquatic
  environment. There are two potential problems in application of this technique
  for monitoring petroleum exploration and production in the northern North Sea
  and Arctic sea. Norwegian crude oils are characteristically very light, with a
  relatively low aromatic hydrocarbon content and thus may produce a relatively
  low response. Moreover, reported laboratory studies with a temperate fish
  species have indicated that the response may be repressed or non-existent at
  low temperatures. From field studies of the Braer oilspill in Shetland when
  85,000 tonnes of Gulfaks crude escaped, we found that whilst muscle PAH levels
  were not significantly elevated, hepatic CYP1A levels in inshore fish species
  were induced and that this induction persisted for some 5 months after the
  incident. Thus the enzymic response appears to be a more sensitive and
  persistent indicator of environmental pollution by this type of crude oil than
  chemical analyses. In laboratory experiments we have demonstrated that hepatic
  CYP1A of polar cod (Boreogadus saida) is inducible both by systemically
  administered crude oil at 0 degree C and by dietary exposure to crude oil
  during the reproductive season at water temperatures between 3 and 6 degree C,
  thus establishing that in this species the inductive response is not suppressed
  by low environmental temperatures and that polar cod can be utilised as a
  sentinel species in Arctic waters.

  B. affinis to overwinter and establish was investigated at 2 sites in northern
  California; a pond in Calaveras County and the Chowchilla River in Madera
  County. In cage studies conducted at the pond, B. affinis survived the winter
  for 2 seasons. After releases at the pond, B. affinis successfully reproduced
  and survived during the summer of 1992. Weevil larvae had damaged both sentinel
  and native tubers at the site. In the spring, following the release of B.
  affinis at the pond, a light trap and baited shelter traps were used to detect
  weevils that had overwintered naturally at the site. No weevils were recovered.
  At the Chowchilla River site, B. affinis failed to establish, possibly due to a
  lack of tubers in the section of the river where the releases were made.

  sediments, plants and invertebrates in the vicinity of a ferro-nickel smelting
  plant and in a control site in Greece. The concentrations of metals in the
  sediment were higher than those found in the average unpolluted Greek coastal
  sediment. Animals collected near the smelter also had higher concentrations
  than those obtained from the control site. Higher levels were observed in the
  gastropod molluscs, where the concentrations in the viscera were statistically
  higher than those in the muscle. From the species examined, Cerithium vulgatum
  showed the highest concentrations of metals and could be used as a "sentinel
  species" for metal contamination.

AB: A study was conducted to determine the feasibility of establishing a
  sentinel human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) surveillance system involving
  patients with sexually transmitted diseases attending private clinics and a
  government sexually transmitted disease clinic in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
  Information on risk behaviours for HIV infection were also collected. A total
  of 84 female and 91 male patients were interviewed and tested for HIV
  infection; 41.7% of the women reported working as prostitutes, other
  occupations included masseuses, hairdressers, waitresses, salesgirls,
  receptionists, factory workers, and others. The most common diagnosis was
  gonorrhoea. Other diagnoses included non-specific genital infection, pelvic
  inflammatory disease, genital herpes and syphilis. 58.3% of the women had a
  hundred or more sex partners during the previous month; 99% had 6 or more sex
  partners. Only 4.8% of female patients had their male partners using condoms
  most of the time, 11.9% hardly used condoms at all. Of the males, 93.3% were
  heterosexual, while 6.7% were bisexuals, 41.1% had between 6-20 different
  partners in the previous year. 78.0% of them had prostitutes as their sex
  partners most of the time. 41.8% had experiences in Thailand and the
  Philippines. 73.6% never used condoms, while 19.8% only used condoms rarely.
  Although all patients were tested negative for HIV antibodies, lot quality
  assurance sampling methods indicate that the upper limits of prevalences for
  females and males were 3.5% and 3.3% respectively, at a 5% type I error. The
  study has shown that it is feasible to carry out a sentinel surveillance
  programme among STD patients and provided useful baseline data for future
  comparisons. The high prevalence of risk behaviours among STD patients is
  alarming and underscores the urgency of multiagency cooperation and aggressive
  health education and behaviour change programmes to combat the growing problem
  of HIV infection in the country.

AB: BACKGROUND: The poor development of systems of occupational surveillance in
  Spain is an important obstacle for implementing effective occupational health
  programmes. The objective of this study is to evaluate the utility and
  feasibility of an occupational health surveillance system in a Health Area,
  using the available public sanitary resources, between 1991 and 1993. METHODS:
  The surveillance system is based on the identification of Sentinel Health
  Events (Rutstein and cols.) from registers or by notification, obtaining
  additional information through the procedure of interview. Distribution of
  cases by condition, level of response to the interviews, and distribution of
  cases according to its source of information are analysed. The evaluation is
  made on the following criteria: required elements, utility, representativeness,
  choice between sensibility and specificity, and limitations. RESULTS: 314
  sentinel health events were identified, from which, in 33 cases, occupational
  exposure to causal agents was confirmed. The occupational diseases notified
  from compensation systems were 31. 3 cases of interstitial pneumonia were
  identified, that allowed the detection of an outbreak in textile workers.
  CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of systems of occupational surveillance, in the
  actual spanish sanitary context, should take into account the following
  aspects: organizational flexibility, efficiency, and orientation towards
  intervention.

AB: Captive-reared mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were used as sentinels to study
  the epizootiology of avian botulism at the Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge,
  Willows, California (USA) from 1986 to 1989. Sentinel mallards were wing
  -clipped, and 40 to 50 birds were confined in 1.6-ha enclosures in 11 selected
  wetlands (pools). Enclosures were searched intensively three to four times
  weekly from July through October. Sick and dead wild and sentinel birds were
  collected, necropsied, and tested for type C botulism toxin. Botulism
  epizootics occurred in sentinel mallards in 1986, 1987, and 1989, but only a
  few isolated cases of botulism were detected in 1988. In most epizootics,
  botulism also was detected simultaneously in wild birds using the same pool
  outside the enclosure. Epizootics in sentinels were initiated and perpetuated
  in the absence of vertebrate carcasses. A sex-specific trend in the probability
  of intoxication was detected, with males contracting botulism at a higher rate
  than females. Daily mortality rates of sentinels during botulism epizootics
  ranged from 0.0006 to 0.0600, with a mean of 0.0190. These rates would result
  in the daily loss of 0.6 to 60 birds per thousand at risk. The use of sentinel
  birds provided an effective means of gathering site-specific epizootiologic
  data.

AB: An immunohistochemical assay for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)
  identifies cells in all active phases of the cell cycle. In this study, PCNA
  methodology, which was developed primarily for mammalian tissues, was adapted
  to three small fish species, medaka (Oryzias latipes), guppy (Poecilia
  reticulata), and western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) that are used in
  carcinogenesis bioassays and environmental sentinel studies. Our study showed
  that PCNA can be identified in routinely processed, paraffin embedded specimens
  of these fishes. Optimum staining conditions were dependent on fixative,
  primary antibody, antigen retrieval processing, and protein blocking reagent.
  Best results were achieved using 10% neutral buffered formalin as the fixative,
  clone PC10 as the primary antibody, and a combination of powdered milk and
  bovine serum albumin as a protein block. Except for medaka specimens, antigen
  retrieval was not required for specimens preserved in 10% neutral buffered
  formalin, but was required for the other fixatives tested. In whole fish
  specimens, PCNA marked cells in normally proliferating tissues such as testis,
  ovary, primary filament epithelium of the gill, hematopoietic tissues, thymus,
  retina and alimentary tract. The study demonstrated the successful application
  of mammalian-based PCNA technology to these aquatic species. Further
  applications of the assay will aid in understanding the role of cell
  proliferation in normal, diseased, and toxicant-affected tissues of aquatic
  animals.

AB: We use the available information about concentrations of dioxin in highly
  exposed humans along with estimates of the half-life of dioxin and durations of
  exposure to calculate lifetime average daily doses (LADDs) of dioxin in those
  populations. We compare those LADDs to the LADDs of dioxin used in rodent
  carcinogen tests, and we also compare the tissue levels of dioxin in exposed
  humans and the test rodents. Using the maximum likelihood estimate of the
  Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) calculated potency factor for the
  carcinogenicity of dioxin, we calculate the number of cancers that dioxin might
  be expected to cause in the exposed human populations. If dioxin causes an
  increase in total cancers or of a common cancer such as lung cancer, the
  calculated expected increases in cancer are below the limit of detectability in
  epidemiologic studies. If, on the other hand, dioxin causes a tumor with
  incidence comparable to that of soft tissue sarcomas, the calculated expected
  increases should be detectable in dioxin-exposed chemical workers and in the
  Seveso population. Our calculations lead to the conclusion that the failure of
  epidemiology to produce convincing evidence of any chronic human health effects
  from dioxin probably results from the relatively low exposures experienced by
  humans. From our analyses, there is no reason to allude to differential
  sensitivities between test animals and humans to explain the lack of convincing
  evidence for dioxin causing human cancers.

AB: A study of the natral history and risk factors for hepatitis A can shed
  light on the potential for contamination of plasma concentrate with hepatitis A
  virus (HAV). According to the long-term Sentinel Counties Study conducted by
  Alter and colleagues at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
  Atlanta, the most frequently reported risk factors for HAV infection are living
  with a patient who has hepatitis, homosexual activity, and close contact with
  young children. International travel to hepatitis A endemic areas and illicit
  parenteral drug use were less frequently documented risk factors, although
  illicit injectable drug use has been considered more significant in other
  hepatitis A studies. Approximately 40% of patients with hepatitis A reported no
  apparent risk factors. Hepatitis A occurs most often today in the 5- to 30-year
  -old age group. Young adults, who are also eligible donors, are thus at risk of
  infection. The natural history of hepatitis A was studied in New World owl
  monkeys. Fecal shedding of infectious virus was detected by 4 days after
  intravenous injection of infectious material and peaked at almost 10 million
  infectious particles per gram of feces just prior to onset of chemical evidence

AB: OBJECTIVE: To describe HIV seroprevalence among non-injecting drug users
  (non-IDU) entering sentinel drug treatment centers in the United States.
  DESIGN: Anonymous, blinded (unlinked) HIV seroprevalence surveys. SETTING:
  Sixty-eight sentinel drug treatment centers in 37 United States metropolitan
  areas. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive sample of clients admitted to sentinel drug
  treatment centers from January 1989 through December 1992. Of 84,617 clients,
  37,633 (44.5%) had used illicit drugs but reported no injecting drug use since
  1978. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Center-specific, metropolitan area-specific, and
  national median HIV seroprevalence rates. RESULTS: National median center
  -specific HIV seroprevalence among non-IDU was 3.2% (range, 0-15.2%). Rates
  varied widely by geographic area. Median rates were highest in the northeast
  (5.6%; range, 0-15.2%), intermediate in the south (3.4%; range, 0.6-8.0%), and
  generally lower throughout the rest of the country: midwest (1.3%; range, 0
  -3.1%) and west (1.8%; range, 0-14.5%). When stratified by treatment center,
  there were few statistically significant differences in seroprevalence among
  African Americans, Hispanics and whites. The median rate was 3.4% among men and
  2.7% among women. Rates among non-IDU were lower than among IDU attending the
  same drug treatment centers, but consistently higher than among heterosexual
  patients attending sexually transmitted disease clinics in the same
  metropolitan areas. CONCLUSIONS: HIV seroprevalence among non-IDU entering drug
  treatment is high in many metropolitan areas. HIV prevention and education
  efforts in drug treatment centers should target sexual as well as drug-use risk
  reduction for all clients.

AB: OBJECTIVE. The study goal was to assess the extent of workplace-related
  disease and injury among Social Security Disability Insurance applicants.
  METHODS. A convenience sample of 240 consecutive applicants to the Pennsylvania
  Bureau of Disability Determination was studied to assess the prevalence of work
  -related disorders. An applicant had a work-related condition if there was a
  clear statement of a workplace illness or injury associated with the
  impairment, or if the applicant had worked at an occupation with a high
  likelihood of exposures known or suspected to contribute to the condition of
  interest. RESULTS. Of the 240 applicants, 166 (69%) were awarded disability
  insurance benefits; a total of 27 (11%) had work-related conditions, including
  14 of the 166 (8%) who were found to be disabled. Forty percent of the 27 had a
  disorder that was musculoskeletal in origin. Of 59 applicants with cancer,
  10.2% had some work-related etiological component. Of an estimated 71,680 adult
  disability insurance applicants in Pennsylvania in 1990, 5134 new insurance
  beneficiaries had a projected occupationally related disability. CONCLUSIONS. A
  substantial number of applicants for disability insurance benefits suffer from
  an impairment caused or exacerbated by prior workplace exposures. These
  individuals may serve as sentinel events for initiating follow-up surveillance
  and prevention activities.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To determine whether saliva could serve as an alternative to
  serum for HIV-antibody testing in an ongoing sentinel surveillance program in
  Thailand. METHODS: Serum and saliva specimens were collected from 1955
  individuals in four of the 73 sentinel sites of the national surveillance
  program in Thailand. Intravenous drug users, female prostitutes, and men
  attending sexually transmitted disease clinics were included as participants.
  All specimens were collected and tested anonymously. Saliva was gathered with
  the Omni-Sal collection device and analyzed for the presence of HIV antibodies
  using the immunoglobulin G antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
  (GACELISA) laboratory test, specially designed for low concentration body
  fluids. Our gold standard was serum, collected and analyzed independently from
  the saliva specimens, using an ELISA test for screening and Western blot for
  confirmation. Linkage between serum and saliva was blind to the laboratory. A
  set of HIV-positive and HIV-negative quality assurance samples for both serum
  and saliva were also analyzed blind. RESULTS: Findings are presented as
  observed in the field, and as quality assurance samples after the correction of
  various field and laboratory errors. The sensitivity of the GACELISA with
  saliva was 98.0% in the field (298 HIV-positive specimens), 100% after
  correction of errors (300 HIV-positive specimens), and 100% among the quality
  assurance samples (95 HIV-positive specimens). The specificity of the GACELISA
  was 99.4% in the field (1653 HIV-negative specimens), 99.6% after correction of
  errors (1654 HIV-negative specimens), and 100% among the quality assurance
  samples (96 HIV-negative specimens). CONCLUSION: Our findings support other
  published studies that also featured the GACELISA. We conclude that saliva is
  comparable to serum for assessing HIV antibodies in individuals for
  surveillance and screening purposes.

AB: Two 2-yr feeding studies were conducted in Swiss CD-1 mice to evaluate the
  oral toxicity and carcinogenicity potential of olestra, a fat substitute
  consisting of a mixture of the hexa-, hepta- and octaesters of sucrose formed
  with long-chain fatty acids. In a dose-response study olestra was fed at 0,
  2.5, 5 or 10% (w/w) of the diet. In a companion study conducted to confirm
  equivocal effects, olestra was fed at 0 or 10% (w/w) of the diet. Olestra
  -containing diets were supplemented with fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K to
  maintain the nutritional status of the olestra-fed mice at a level similar to
  that of the control mice. 100 mice/sex were placed in each group. 50
  mice/sex/group were predesignated to the carcinogenicity portion of the study
  and all survivors were killed at 24 months. 15 mice/sex/group were
  predesignated to the toxicity portion of the study and were killed at 12
  months. 35 mice/sex/group were included as sentinel animals to be used for
  monitoring nutritional status. Ophthalmoscopic examinations were conducted
  before the test and at 12 and 24 months. Body weights and feed consumption were
  determined weekly. Gross observations, clinical chemistry and haematology data
  were obtained on animals killed at 12 and 24 months. Complete gross post-mortem
  examinations, including organ weight and organ-to-body and organ-to-brain
  weight ratios were performed on all animals. Histopathology was conducted on a
  full complement of tissues from all animals allocated to the carcinogenicity
  portions of the studies. There were no olestra-related effects on any of the
  endpoints measured, including survival, time-to-tumour or tumour incidence,
  ophthalmology, clinical chemistry, haematology, organ weights or tissue
  morphology. These results indicate that olestra is not toxic or carcinogenic
  when fed to mice at up to 10% of the diet for 2 yr.

AB: Recent experimental and clinical reports suggest that the intracisternal
  administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) within 72
  hours of subarachnoid hemorrhage decreases the incidence of severe angiographic
  and clinical vasospasm. In this report, we present four of eight patients with
  aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage who developed angiographic and clinical
  vasospasm with delayed neurological deterioration, despite the use of
  intracisternal tPA after early aneurysm clipping. One patient did not clear her
  massive subarachnoid hemorrhage with tPA; one patient had extremely poor
  collateral flow with occlusion of one cervical internal carotid artery and 80%
  stenosis of the other cervical internal carotid artery; the other two patients
  had a subarachnoid hemorrhage 7 to 12 days after their sentinel hemorrhage.
  Three patients ultimately made excellent or good recoveries, and one was left
  with hemiparesis. The four other patients treated by this protocol did not
  develop vasospasm. We conclude that intracisternal tPA may not prevent
  vasospasm in certain patients. This may relate to inadequate clearing of the
  subarachnoid clot, pre-existing poor collateral supply, or the occurrence of
  prior subarachnoid hemorrhage.

AB: To assess the potential of western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) for the
  detection of environmental carcinogens, laboratory-reared specimens were
  exposed to methylazoxymethanol acetate 10 mg per 1 for 2 h and then examined
  periodically for the onset of neoplastic lesions. Approximately 33 per cent of
  the exposed fish developed liver neoplasms within 25 weeks of exposure and 52
  per cent within 40 weeks. The lesions were mostly hepatocellular carcinomas and
  cholangiocarcinomas. No neoplastic lesions were detected in other organs. The
  carcinogen sensitivity and the widespread distribution of the mosquitofish
  suggest that this species would be useful as a warm water sentinel for
  environmental contamination.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
  infection among health care workers who donate blood. DESIGN: Point prevalence
  survey of blood donors. SETTING: 20 U.S. blood centers that participate in an
  ongoing interview study of HIV-seropositive blood donors. MEASUREMENTS:
  Prevalence rates for HIV in persons who reported being health care workers were
  measured directly for 6 of the 20 blood centers. For the other 14 centers, we
  derived the numerator from the interview study in the same manner used for the
  6 centers; we estimated the denominator using blood collection logs at those
  centers and extrapolations from the survey completed at the 6 blood centers.
  RESULTS: Between March 1990 and August 1991, 8519 health care workers donated
  blood at 6 hospitals and other medical facilities. Three persons were HIV
  seropositive: Two reported being health care workers and having nonoccupational
  risk factors for HIV infection; the occupation and other possible risk factors
  of the third seropositive donor could not be determined. Therefore, the highest
  overall prevalence of HIV infection among health care worker donors at these 6
  centers was 0.04% (3 of 8519; upper limit of 95% CI, 0.1%). We estimated that
  during the same period, approximately 36,329 health care workers were tested
  for HIV at all 20 centers. Twenty-seven persons infected with HIV who donated
  at hospitals were identified; 7 did not return for interviews, so their health
  care occupations could not be verified. Thus, the highest estimated overall
  prevalence of HIV infection among health care worker donors at the 20 centers
  was 0.07% (27 of 36,329; upper limit of CI, 0.1%). Of the 20 known health care
  worker donors, 11 reported nonoccupational risks for HIV infection; 3 of the
  remaining 9 health care workers described occupational blood exposures that
  could have resulted in transmission of HIV. CONCLUSIONS: Blood donors can serve
  as a sentinel cohort when evaluating the risk for occupationally acquired HIV
  infection. These findings suggest that among the many health care worker donors
  in this study, HIV infection attributable to occupational exposure was uncommon.

AB: A prospective STD surveillance system was developed in Italy in 1990. Newly
  diagnosed cases of sexually transmitted disease (STD) are reported by a network
  of 45 sentinel STD clinics throughout the country. A total of 10,253 patients
  were reported between September 1990 and December 1991. The most frequent
  diagnoses were genital warts (30.8%), non-specific genital infection (male)
  (12.8%), and non-specific genital infection (female) (11.5%). All patients were
  asked to undergo an HIV test; 68.4% accepted, of whom 9.3% were seropositive.
  During the 16-month study period HIV prevalence decreased among IDUs and homo
  -bisexuals, but increased among non-IDU heterosexuals. These data suggest that
  STD patients may represent a useful early warning system to detect changes in
  the epidemic and in the spread of the virus among low-risk heterosexuals. A
  better counselling programme is needed to improve the acceptance rate of HIV
  testing among STD patients, and to draw more attention to at-risk sexual
  behaviours.

AB: PROBLEM/CONDITION: A case of occupational asthma is a sentinel health event
  indicating a need for preventive intervention. REPORTING PERIOD COVERED: 1988
  -1992. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEMS: As part of the Sentinel Event Notification
  System for Occupational Risks (SENSOR) Program, initiated by CDC's National
  Institute for Occupational Safety and Health in 1987, state-based surveillance
  and intervention programs for occupational asthma (OA) have been under
  development in Michigan and New Jersey. The initial 5-year projects in these
  states have been completed. RESULTS: From 1988 through 1992, the SENSOR
  programs in these states identified a total of 535 cases of occupational asthma
  and related conditions. Of these 535 cases, 328 cases met the SENSOR
  surveillance case definition for OA. In addition, 128 cases were classified as
  possible OA, 42 as reactive airways dysfunction syndrome, and 37 as
  occupationally aggravated asthma. In both Michigan and New Jersey,
  manufacturing was the industrial sector with the largest proportion of cases.
  In Michigan, > 40% of the case-patients worked in transportation equipment
  manufacturing. In New Jersey, 15% of case-patients worked in manufacturing of
  chemicals and allied products. Overall, isocyanates were the most frequently
  reported asthma-causing agents (19.4% of cases). Follow-up industrial hygiene
  sampling measured suspect agents at airborne concentrations generally below the
  permissible exposure limits established by the Occupational Safety and Health
  Administration. INTERPRETATION: In its first 5 years, the SENSOR system has led
  to the identification of previously unrecognized causes of occupational asthma.
  Overall findings indicate the need for more comprehensive control of such well
  -known occupational allergens as the isocyanates. In addition, SENSOR
  interventions have prompted improvements in protection for workers. ACTIONS
  TAKEN: Approaches to state-based surveillance and intervention for OA are being
  developed through newly funded 5-year SENSOR projects in four states
  (California, Massachusetts, Michigan, and New Jersey). The goal is to develop a
  model for effective state-based OA surveillance that can be applied by any
  state health department.

AB: 693 IVDU (intravenous drug user) sera from Copenhagen, Malmo and Stockholm
  were tested, 247 retro- and 446 prospectively, for antibodies to human T
  -lymphotropic virus (HTLV), types I and II, by means of a commercial whole
  -virus EIA and/or an HTLV-I/-II peptide-based EIA. Positive EIA reactions were
  checked and typed by electrophoretic immunoblotting, a differential peptide
  -based EIA and nucleic acid amplification/hybridization with HTLV-I and -II
  specific primers and probes. 3 (0.7%) of the prospectively tested IVDUs from
  Malmo, none of 100 from Stockholm and none of 45 from Copenhagen were HTLV
  -seropositive. The 3 Malmo IVDU cases were a female immigrant from South
  America, her male native Swedish spouse (both HTLV-I), and a male immigrant
  Italian heroinist (HTLV-II). We conclude that HTLV was uncommon among
  intravenous drug users, a sentinel population, in Sweden and Denmark during
  1986 and 1989. However, the occurrence of 3 HTLV-positive cases in Malmo 1993
  indicates that the situation can change rapidly.

AB: BACKGROUND. Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common condition in primary
  care, yet little is known about its presentation and management. This study was
  designed to provide a better understanding of the frequency of CTS in a primary
  care population, and its presentation, diagnosis, and management. METHODS.
  Clinicians in 74 Ambulatory Sentinel Practice Network (ASPN) practices from 30
  states and three Canadian provinces collected data on all patients presenting
  with symptoms of CTS during a 30-month period. RESULTS. The adjusted
  frequencies of all visits and of first visits for symptoms of CTS were 1.01 and
  0.68 per 1000 patient visits, respectively. Women visited more frequently than
  men with new onset symptoms of CTS (0.81 vs 0.55 per 1000 visits), and
  homemakers accounted for 15.9% of all new cases. Clinicians judged 43.1% of all
  CTS incident visits to be job-related. The diagnostic evaluation of patients
  seldom included nerve conduction studies (12.9%) or electromyography (11.8%).
  The most frequent treatments were splints (56.3%) and nonsteroidal anti
  -inflammatory agents (50.8%). Four-month follow-up data were obtained for 68.5%
  of the patients, and symptom relief was reported by 55.2% of patients. Ninety
  percent of patients were able to continue working at the same job, and 96% were
  able to continue their usual activities. CONCLUSIONS. Carpal tunnel syndrome
  symptoms are common in primary care, and most cases occur among women, many of
  whom are homemakers. Most patients with CTS symptoms are treated conservatively
  by their primary care clinicians with minimal testing or referral, and most
  patients report improvement or resolution of symptoms at 4 months.

AB: Incidence and surveillance of foodborne diseases in the 1980s and 1990s in
  The Netherlands are discussed. In most countries, as in The Netherlands, only
  outbreaks of foodborne diseases are reported to the national authorities,
  whereas single cases are not notifiable. Surveillance and population studies
  have revealed that only a minority of foodborne diseases are reported by this
  approach. As a consequence, little information is available about the real
  hazards. Aspects considered include: reported incidents (foodborne disease
  outbreaks involving `sw700 people); incidence of foodborne disease (number of
  outbreaks, cases in outbreaks and single cases) with known and unknown
  aetiology in The Netherlands as reported by the regional Food Inspection
  Services; causative agents in foodborne diseases with known aetiology in 1983
  -1990 in The Netherlands as reported to the regional Food Inspection Services;
  foods involved (or suspected) in outbreaks and single cases of foodborne
  diseases in The Netherlands as reported to the regional Food Inspection
  Services; causes and incidences of acute gastroenteritis in The Netherlands
  between 1987 and 1992; and sentinel and population studies. It is concluded
  that stronger effort should be made to obtain more realistic information,
  including recognition of both new and emerging foodborne pathogens.

AB: Three years of extensive monitoring for tributyltin (TBT) and its
  degradation products in tissue of sentinel bivalve molluscs at 69 East Coast
  and 42 West Coast sites of the US suggested that tissue levels of organotins
  are decreasing systematically at some sites and remaining static or fluctuating
  at others. Local effects driving input of TBT and influencing overall health of
  the organisms were suggested as being responsible for these observations. The
  ratio of TBT to its principal degradation product dibutyltin (DBT) in bivalve
  mollusc tissues appeared to be species specfic and constant over a wide range
  of butyltin concn. in the animals. The TBT/DBT ratios (mean +- 1 s.d) were
  determined for the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) (2.6 +- 1.0), the California
  mussel (M. californianus) (6.2 +- 4.0), and the Eastern oyster (Crassostrea
  virginica) (6.2 +- 3.4).

AB: As part of its National Status and Trends Program, NOAA initiated a
  monitoring activity, its Mussel Watch Project, in 1986 to assess the current
  status of, and to detect changes in, contaminant levels along the marine coasts
  of the United States using bivalve mollusks as sentinel organisms. The Mussel
  Watch Project was extended in 1992 to include seven sites in the U.S. Great
  Lakes' waters from Saginaw Bay to western Lake Erie. Zebra mussels (Driessena
  polymorpha) were collected at each site with three samples of approximately 250
  large specimens selected for analysis from each of the five sites where
  sufficient material was obtained. At the two remaining sites only enough
  material for one set of analyses was available. The concentrations of 60
  organic contaminants including 24 PAH compounds, 20 PCB congeners, DDT and its
  metabolites, and 9 other pesticides were quantified for these samples. The
  level of some of these toxic contaminants clearly differed among sites and
  usually ranged over a factor of at least three. The highest concentrations were
  generally found at sites in proximity to the Detroit (Grosse Ile) and near the
  mouth of the Saginaw River, with the lowest concentrations found in lower Lake
  Huron and the Reno Beach area of western Lake Erie. The contaminant levels
  quantified in Great Lakes zebra mussel tissues fall within the ranges found in
  bivalve tissues at U.S. marine sites. The levels of total PCBs at Grosse Ile,
  Put-in-Bay, and the Saginaw River were found to be relatively high on a
  national basis (i.e., greater than one standard deviation above the national
  mean) as was the total PAH level at Grosse Ile.

AB: The trace metals Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn were analyzed in the following inert and
  biological compartments of the ecosystem of the Mirgenbach reservoir: the
  water, the suspended solids, the settling particulate matter, a bryophyte, a
  mollusc and three organs of two dominant fish species. This man-made lake
  receives the warmed waters from the nuclear power plant in Cattenom
  (Northeastern France). The Lindre pond and an upper section of the Meuse River
  were chosen as reference sites. All the analyzed substrata showed that the
  Mirgenbach reservoir is strongly contaminated with copper and moderately with
  lead and zinc. High burdens of cadmium were only detected in the sediment
  samples. The trace metals entering the reservoir partition between two
  different phases: the water column and the sediments. The elevated
  concentrations observed in the settling particulate matter indicate that a
  large amount of each metal is eliminated from the water. In the particular case
  of copper, estimations of fluxes showed that two thirds of the discharged metal
  were trapped in the sediments. The good agreement of metal detection in the
  mussel Dreissena polymorpha Pallas and in the moss Fontinalis antipyretica
  Hedw. emphasizes the suitability of both organisms to be used as biological
  indicators for water pollution. The two fish species, the roach Rutilus rutilus
  L. and the perch Perca fluviatilis L., exhibited low metal concentrations in
  their muscle flesh. Although accumulation occurred in the target tissues, e.g.
  copper in the liver and lead in the kidney, fish cannot be considered as
  adequate sentinel organisms.

AB: Bivalves are often used as sentinel organisms in monitoring programmes for
  trace organic contaminants. The animal's physiological state may be important
  in interpreting trends in contaminant body burden. Simultaneous evaluation of
  physiological state and organic contaminant concentration in bivalves typically
  involves removal of a lipid-rich cross-section of the body mass for
  histopathological and/or gonadal analysis. In this study, the bias introduced
  by this technique in the final trace organic concentrations, e.g. of
  polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated pesticides and polychlorinated
  biphenyls, are evaluated on five different size groups of oysters. As a test
  case, we evaluated the use of this method in the NOAA's Status & Trends Mussel
  Watch (NS&T) Programme. The average biases introduced by this technique in the
  final trace organic concentrations in Gulf of Mexico oysters have been
  increasing since 1986 as a consequence of a continuous decrease in the size of
  the individuals sampled.

AB: Organochlorine analysis was performed on adult and juvenile farm-raised
  mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) released and collected at three experimental
  sites in southern Ontario: Hamilton Harbour Confined Disposal Facility (CDF);
  Winona Sewage Lagoons (SL); and Big Creek Marsh, Canada. Collections were
  scheduled at 10, 30, and 70 days after release. Hamilton Harbour CDF and Winona
  SL are known to be contaminated whereas Big Creek Marsh is a relatively clean,
  natural site. All sites are important resting and feeding areas for migratory
  and resident waterfowl. Breast muscle concentrations of polychlorobiphenyls
  (PCBs) in ducks collected 10 days after release (160.8 mu g/kg, wet wt) at
  Hamilton Harbour CDF were more than 5300 times greater than day "0" birds (0.03
  mu g/kg). All ducks collected from Hamilton Harbour CDF had PCB concentrations
  exceeding Health and Welfare Canada and United States Food and Drug
  Administration (FDA) guidelines for edible poultry. Concentrations of DDE
  (216.9 mu g/kg), hexachlorobenzene (0.9 mu g/kg), dieldrin (1.9 mu g/kg), and
  1,2,4,5,-tetrachlorobenzene (24.9 mu g/kg) were significantly elevated in ducks
  utilizing Winona SL. Concentrations of 1,2,3,4-tetrachlorobenzene, mirex, and
  photomirex were elevated at one or more of the sites. Ducks from Big Creek
  Marsh had lower contaminant concentrations than ducks from the other study
  sites. It is not clear whether bioaccumulation of organochlorines at these
  sites would pose a potential hazard to migratory and resident mallards;
  however, other duck species such as diving ducks that more contact with
  sediments and sediment-derived foods would probably be at much higher risk.

AB: The possible relationship between the incidence of respiratory diseases as
  reported to general practitioners and numbers of registered deaths in England
  and Wales has been examined. Morbidity data from sentinel practices for the
  period 1986-1990 were used to calculate weekly rates of aggregated respiratory
  disease for persons of all ages and for elderly persons. The elderly
  respiratory disease rates and numbers of deaths were aggregated into 4-week
  periods; secular and seasonal trends were removed from each series and the two
  sets of residuals were examined graphically and cross correlation coefficients
  calculated. There was a very strong positive association between the
  respiratory disease rate and number of deaths in the same 4-week period and
  there was also a significant but less pronounced association between
  respiratory disease in one 4-week period and deaths in the next. After prior
  separation of weeks according to temperature into four bands, weekly rates for
  respiratory disease were also strongly associated with the number of weekly
  deaths for each temperature band. The synchronisation of peaks and troughs in
  the two series throughout the year supports the hypothesis that a cause and
  effect relationship exists between respiratory disease in the elderly and
  number of deaths. Other climatic and meteorological variables besides
  temperature may play a part in determining the spread of a respiratory disease.
  There is a need for further research to identify the micro-organisms
  responsible for acute respiratory infections in the elderly.

AB: The molecular, biochemical, and cellular precursors to disease are common to
  wildlife and humans. Colonial fish-eating birds have been used as convenient
  sentinel biological systems for detection and monitoring of the effects of
  chronic exposure to complex mixtures of persistent toxic environmental
  contaminants within the Great Lakes ecosystem. Studies of impairments to health
  using such biomarkers as induction of mixed function oxidases, alterations in
  heme biosynthesis, retinol homeostasis, thyroid function and DNA integrity and
  various manifestations of reproductive and developmental toxicity in these
  birds suggests the severity varies with time and location and generally
  decreased between the early 1970s and late 1980s. However, these studies
  confirm the continued presence of sufficient amounts of PCBs and related
  persistent halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons in forage fish to cause
  physiological impairments in these birds over much of the Great Lakes basin.
  The elimination of such impairments will be a measures our success in
  remediation of Areas of Concern and "virtual elimination" of persistent
  polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbon contaminants from the Great Lakes
  ecosystem.

AB: The trace metals Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn were analyzed in the following inert and
  biological compartments of the ecosystem of the Mirgenbach reservoir: the
  water, the suspended solids, the settling particulate matter, a bryophyte, a
  mollusc and three organs of two dominant fish species. This man-made lake
  receives the warmed waters from the nuclear power plant in Cattenom
  (Northeastern France). The Lindre pond and an upper section of the Meuse River
  were chosen as reference sites. All the analyzed substrata showed that the
  Mirgenbach reservoir is strongly contaminated with copper and moderately with
  lead and zinc. High burdens of cadmium were only detected in the sediment
  samples. The trace metals entering the reservoir partition between two
  different phases: the water column and the sediments. The elevated
  concentrations observed in the settling particulate matter indicate that a
  large amount of each metal is eliminated from the water. In the particular case
  of copper, estimations of fluxes showed that two thirds of the discharged metal
  were trapped in the sediments. The good agreement of metal detection in the
  mussel Dreissena polymorpha Pallas and in the moss Fontinalis antipyretica
  Hedw. emphasizes the suitability of both organisms to be used as biological
  indicators for water pollution. The two fish species, the roach Rutilus rutilus
  L. and the perch Perca fluviatilis L., exhibited low metal concentrations in
  their muscle flesh. Although accumulation occurred in the target tissues, e.g.
  copper in the liver and lead in the kidney, fish cannot be considered as
  adequate sentinel organisms.

  trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) at Silverstream Fish Hatchery near Christchurch in
  1980. As a consequence, a nationwide survey for M. cerebralis in salmonids was
  conducted by examination of 5307 wild and hatchery fish. In addition, sentinel
  rainbow trout were used at six locations to test for whirling disease. This
  survey and other studies revealed M. cerebralis at locations in the
  Waimakariri, Rakaia, and Rangitata River catchments, and provide the first New
  Zealand records of M. cerebralis in brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis),
  chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), and sockeye salmon (O. nerka). This
  paper demonstrates use of sentinel rainbow trout in detecting low-level
  asymptomatic infection of M. cerebralis in chinook salmon.

  state of the screwworm, Cochliomyia hominivorax (Coquerel), on daily activity
  and oviposition were examined during a 122 d study in a tropical dry forest in
  Costa Rica. Flies were marked and released. Numbers of flies visiting baits
  increased during the wet season and decreased during the dry season; 3 times
  more flies were observed at baits during the wet season than were observed
  during the dry season. An average of 33 females and 3 males was observed per
  day during the study. More flies (3.6 times) were attracted to liver than to
  sentinel sheep; many flies originally marked at liver failed to return and few
  of them oviposited on sentinel sheep. Females marked at sheep were recaptured
  more times and remained in the study area longer. More females marked at sheep
  sites were recaptured (51.4-54.1%) than those marked at liver sites (32.3
  -44.7). More than 6 times as many flies were observed at forest than at pasture
  sites. The physiological state of the female influenced daily activity. High
  temperatures during midday (>31 degree C) depressed activity and decreased the
  number of foraging hours available for flies during the dry season. Decreasing
  host resources and number of hours available for foraging may be factors that
  limit screwworm populations in the dry season.

AB: The concentration of mercury in some commercially important finfishes and
  shellfishes from Ennore Estuary which receives effluent from a chlor-alkali
  plant, has been measured. The concentration registered in finfishes (Chanos
  chanos and Liza macrolepis), prawn (Penaeus indicus) and edible oyster
  (Crassostrea madrasensis) do not pose an imminent threat to the human consumers
  or to the biota themselves. The distribution of mercury load exhibited
  seasonality, the higher values being observed during monsoon period in all the
  organisms. The mercury level observed in the biota is oyster > prawn >
  finfishes. The results indicate the suitability of the oyster, C. madrasensis
  as a sentinel organism for monitoring mercury contamination in estuaries.

AB: The use of sentinel species shows the potential to bridge the gap between
  animal-based and human-based environmental health research. With regard to the
  assessment of environmental contamination, the use of the terms "indicator,"
  "monitor," and "sentinel" has often been confusing and ambiguous. A set of
  definitions is proposed as a standard to rectify this situation. The advantages
  of the use of sentinel species are provided, as well as criteria for sentinel
  selection, based on species characteristics. The recent use of mammals as
  sentinels for human exposure to toxic environmental contaminants is reviewed. A
  tabulated review of mammals proposed as indicators or monitors is included, as
  these may act as a database for the selection of sentinel species for future
  research efforts. The complexity and subtlety of factors interacting between an
  organism and its environment make it imperative that one provide a focused
  definition of what one wants the sentinel to assess and for what particular
  aspect of human health. Some examples of how sentinels might be selected for
  particular research questions are provided.

AB: Specific histopathological parameters have been proposed as good indicators
  of heavy-metal pollution. Hence the study of ultrastructural alterations in
  target organs from sentinel animals after heavy-metal exposure may provide a
  useful tool in understanding the cellular role in heavy-metal metabolism. The
  main purpose of this study was the determination of the ultrastructural changes
  in the different hepatopancreatic-cell types of Thais haemastoma after
  experimental exposure to cadmium. Specimens of this species from the Gulf of
  Valencia were exposed to sublethal doses of cadmium during a period of 96 h.
  The hepatopancreas was excised and prepared in a routine manner for electron
  microscopy. The digestive cells showed accumulation of membrane-bounded
  vesicles containing electrondense granular material and membrane debris.
  Basophilic cells showed swelling of the rough endoplasmic reticulum vesicles.
  The calcium-containing cells seemed to be unaffected by cadmium. These results
  suggest that the digestive cells incorporate cadmium from water and that the
  basophilic cells increase their protein synthesis in order to provide digestive
  enzymes for extracellular digestion and metallothionein-like proteins for
  cadmium binding and excretion.

AB: Mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus) inhabiting a creosote-contaminated site in
  the Elizabeth River, Virginia, exhibit high prevalences of putative
  preneoplastic (73%) and neoplastic (35%) hepatic lesions. Recently,
  extrahepatic neoplasms of renal, pancreatic, vascular, and lymphoid origin were
  also observed in mummichog at this site. Initial studies of this cancer
  epizootic indicate a strong positive association between lesion prevalences and
  chronic exposure of this small estuarine cyprinodontid to PAH-contaminated
  sediments. As part of a research project that aims to establish the mummichog
  as a model of environmental hepatocarcinogenesis, the cellular and subcellular
  morphology of hepatocellular carcinomas found in Elizabeth River fish was
  compared with the liver morphology of fish from a relatively uncontaminated
  site. Carcinomas exhibited a range of cellular patterns from well
  -differentiated, trabecular lesions to poorly differentiated, mitotically
  active neoplasms resembling hepatoblastoma. Ultrastructurally, neoplastic
  hepatocytes exhibited moderate-to-extreme variation in size shape, and
  orientation, alterations in nuclear morphology, and a general decrease in the
  content of intracellular storage products (lipid, glycogen). Non-neoplastic
  hepatocytes bordering carcinomas often exhibited evidence of sublethal cellular
  damage, including mitochrondrial swelling and accumulation of heterogeneous
  dense bodies presumed to be ceroid/lipofuscin. Similar changes were observed
  within some neoplastic hepatocytes. Bile canaliculi were generally well
  developed in the well-differentiated neoplasms, whereas in the poorly
  differentiated, highly anaplastic lesions they were often very small and poorly
  formed. We saw no evidence of an infectious agent in the 20 cases that were
  examined ultrastructurally. This further supports the hypothesis that this
  epizootic has a chemical aetiology. The detailed morphological classifications
  currently being developed for the hepatic and extra-hepatic lesions of
  Elizabeth River mummichog may facilitate the use of this small non-migratory
  species as a sentinel of contaminated estuarine environments along the east
  coast of the United States.

AB: Three years of extensive monitoring for tributyltin (TBT) and its
  degradation products in tissue of sentinel bivalve mollusks at 69 East Coast

  organotins are decreasing systematically at some sites and remaining static or
  fluctuating at others. Local effects driving input of TBT and influencing the
  overall health of the organisms are suggested at responsible for these
  observations. The ratio of TBT to its principal degradation product dibutyltin
  (DBT) in bivalve mollusk tissues appears to be species specific and constant
  over a wide range of butyltin concentrations in the animals. The TBT/DBT ratios
  (mean plus or minus one standard deviation) were determined for the blue mussel
  Mytilus edulis (2.6), the California mussel Mytilus californianus (6.2), and
  the Eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica (6.2).

AB: Problem/Condition: Improved surveillance for silicosis is needed to target
  interventions to prevent this occupational lung disease caused by the
  inhalation of crystalline silica dust. Reporting Period Covered: 1987-1990.
  Description of Systems: State-based silicosis surveillance and intervention
  programs have been developed in Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio, and Wisconsin as
  part of the Sentinel Event Notification System for Occupational Risks (SENSOR)
  Program, initiated in 1987 by the National Institute for Occupational Safety
  and Health (NIOSH). Results: From 1987 through 1990, the SENSOR program
  confirmed a total of 430 cases of silicosis reported from these four states.
  Overall, approximately 60% of these cases were in workers employed in primary
  metal industries, although the types of industries in which cases occurred
  varied by state. Some cases were attributable to relatively recent exposure,
  including new cases in seven persons first exposed since 1980 in New Jersey.
  Silicosis case reports have prompted measurement of respirable silica
  concentrations at 25 Michigan work sites, and 14 (56%) of these sites were
  found to have levels that exceeded the legally permissible exposure level.
  Interpretation: The silicosis surveillance and intervention strategies piloted
  by state health departments in the NIOSH-funded SENSOR Program have
  demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of identifying specific silica
  -using work sites that need preventive intervention. Actions Taken: On the
  basis of initial experience in these four states, NIOSH developed guidelines
  for state-based silicosis surveillance and awarded SENSOR cooperative
  agreements to three additional states where the applicability of these
  surveillance methods will be further evaluated.

AB: Unlinked anonymous surveys are being conducted on accessible sentinel
  populations in order to monitor the prevalence of HIV infection in England and
  Wales. These populations have been selected either because of, or regardless
  of, their risks for HIV infection. Results are presented for specimens
  collected between January 1990 and July 1992 from 41,461 genito-urinary
  medicine clinic attenders, 5394 injecting drug users, 296,396 antenatal clinic
  attenders, 49,009 neonatal dried blood spots, and 32,796 hospital patients aged
  16 to 49 years. The prevalences of HIV infection in persons attending two
  genito-urinary medicine clinics in London, and who were not known to have
  injected drugs, were 21% for homo/bisexual men, 1% for heterosexual men, and
  0.6% for heterosexual women. At four clinics outside London, the corresponding
  prevalences were 5%, 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively. Of the homo/bisexual men who
  were found to be HIV infected by unlinked anonymous testing, 26% (229 out of
  872) had presented with an acute sexually transmitted disease. Six per cent of
  male and 6.5% of female injecting drug users attending centres in London in
  1991 and 1992 were infected with HIV compared with 0.8% of male and 0.4% of
  female injecting drug users elsewhere. The HIV infection rate was five times
  higher in injecting drug users who had had a previous HIV test (2.7%) than in
  those never previously tested (0.5%). In antenatal clinic attenders in London,
  HIV prevalence was twenty times higher than in pregnant women elsewhere (0.21%
  vs 0.01%) but there was considerable variation in prevalence between individual
  centres. A comparison between unlinked anonymous data and OPCS data for the 15
  London centres suggested that the fraction of HIV prevalence in pregnant women
  at each centre attributable to the proportion of births to mothers born in
  Africa was between 20% and 100%. However, much of the variation in prevalence
  was unexplained, so that firm conclusions cannot be made about this
  relationship. The survey of neonatal dried blood spots showed HIV prevalence in
  South-East London to be 40 times the rate outside London. The prevalence of HIV
  infection at two London district hospitals in patients aged 16 to 49 years,
  from specialties which usually deal with illness not known to be associated
  with HIV infection, was 0.6% for men and 0.2% for women.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT

AB: The Air Sentinel and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membranes were used to
  capture airborne particles over living colonies of German or American
  cockroaches. Silver-stained SDS-PAGE gels revealed protein bands at 80, 55, 36,
  and several bands below the 33-kD marker. SDS-PAGE/immunoblots of PTFE eluates
  from German cockroach colonies incubated with serum from cockroach-sensitive
  individuals revealed IgE-binding bands with apparent molecular weights of 36
  and 80 kD. Only the 36-kD allergen and allergens below the 33-kD marker were
  evident in the American PTFE eluate. ELISA analysis with a monoclonal antibody
  assay identified the presence of both Bla g I and Bla g II in the German PTFE
  eluate. No Bla g I or Bla g II could be identified in the American PTFE eluate.
  These studies demonstrate that in addition to Bla g I and Bla g II, several
  other aerosolized allergens become airborne over cockroach colonies and may be
  important in the environment where cockroaches are abundant.

AB: The use of sentinel species shows the potential to bridge the gap between
  animal-based and human-based environmental health research. With regard to the
  assessment of environmental contamination, the use of the terms "indicator,"
  "monitor," and "sentinel" has often been confusing and ambiguous. A set of
  definitions is proposed as a standard to rectify this situation. The advantages
  of the use of sentinel species are provided, as well as criteria for sentinel
  selection, based on species characteristics. The recent use of mammals as
  sentinels for human exposure to toxic environmental contaminants is reviewed. A
  tabulated review of mammals proposed as indicators or monitors is included, as
  these may act as a database for the selection of sentinel species for future
  research efforts. The complexity and subtlety of factors interacting between an
  organism and its environment make it imperative that one provide a focused
  definition of what one wants the sentinel to assess and for what particular
  aspect of human health. Some examples of how sentinels might be selected for
  particular research questions are provided. While the potential for sentinel
  use in the field of environmental health is enormous, future investigators need
  to choose sentinels carefully, based on well-defined research questions, and
  confine conclusions drawn to the particular problem the sentinel was chosen to
  assess.

AB: The paper reports the results of a quality assurance programme for routine
  biological monitoring of n-hexane exposure via measurement of its urinary
  metabolite 2.5-hexanedione. The programme involved a number of local
  occupational health services and was coordinated by the industrial toxicology
  laboratory in Florence. The analytical results show good agreement (68.6%,
  i.e., 46/67) between high urinary levels of 2.5-hexanedione (equal to or higher
  than an action level of 3.2 mg/l) and a relatively poor environmental situation
  at the workplace as reported by the local occupational health services. The
  fall in the number of 2.5-hexanedione values equal to or higher than the action
  level in the course of the study period (1990-1991) could be a result of the
  prevention measures taken. To confirm this hypothesis, 69 enterprises with at
  least 3 determinations in both 1990 and 1991 were selected. A 58% decrease in
  the mean 2.5-hexanedione value between 1990 and 1992 was observed in the group
  of enterprises (24) with at least one sentinel health event in 1990 (a value
  equal to or higher than 3.2 mg/l). In the group of enterprises with no sentinel
  health event in 1990, the mean 2.5-hexanedione values were practically
  unchanged. The authors stress the need for further studies to test the
  hypotheses based on the data obtained in this study.

AB: OBJECTIVE: Monitoring HIV infection in sentinel populations of sexually
  transmitted disease (STD) patients in several geographical areas. This paper
  describes the main characteristics of the study populations and compares HIV
  seropositivity rates within and between networks in different subgroups: homo
  -/bisexuals, intravenous drug users (IVDU) and non-IVDU heterosexuals. DESIGN:
  HIV testing is performed with informed consent in most networks. It is
  mandatory for STD patients in Hungary, while the English and Welsh, Scottish
  and French networks use unlinked anonymous testing. SETTING: Eighteen networks
  in 17 European countries are participating in the study. The networks usually
  consist of STD or dermato-venereology clinics. PATIENTS: Patients presenting at
  any of the clinic sites with a new episode of one or more of a selected list of
  12 STD were eligible for the study. This study recorded a total of 36,827 STD
  episodes, registered between June 1990 and December 1991. HIV test results were
  known for 33,004 (89.6%) of the patients. RESULTS: HIV seropositivity rates
  were usually much higher for the homo-/bisexual and IVDU patients than for the
  non-IVDU heterosexuals. However, HIV-seropositive patients were found among non
  -IVDU heterosexuals in all but the Czech network. CONCLUSION: This Concerted
  Action has successfully launched an HIV sentinel surveillance programme among
  STD patients in 17 European countries using a standard methodology.

AB: Since 1986, the Federal Health Office (BGA) has supported the model project
  "Monitoring Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) in the Surgeries of Office-Based
  Physicians". The project itself is being carried out by the Institute for
  Health Systems Research in Kiel. The aim of the project is to develop a method
  for the systematic monitoring of the risks involved with selected new drugs.
  This should also facilitate the determining of the incidence rate of ADRs as
  well as reveal as yet unknown ADRs. Several conclusions can be drawn when
  examining the quality of event data when monitoring ADRs through office-based
  physicians. The documentation quality of the transferred data fluctuates from
  surgery to surgery. In order to obtain valid outcomes, the data should be
  thoroughly examined and checked by consulting the participating surgery. When
  quantifying known events with a suspected ADR, the Sentinel approach leads to
  reliable results. When monitoring drug therapies through office-based
  physicians, risk situations can be monitored and assessed more easily under
  everyday conditions. When assessing the quality of event data with regard to
  disclosing hitherto unknown, potential ADRs, the character of the individual
  surgery is of utmost importance. The object of the research project is to
  examine cause-effect associations which have nothing whatsoever to do with the
  participating physicians themselves but which reflect interactions between
  drugs and patients.

AB: The continuous registration of asthmatic attacks by the Swiss Sentinel
  Network "Sentinella" since November 1988 has been preceded by a pilot study
  which tested the methods of data collection and analysis. The original aim was
  (a) to use the incidence of asthmatic attacks as a possible indicator for the
  adverse effects of rising concentrations of air pollutants, and (b) to create a
  set of baseline data for future research in this field, i.e. data of asthmatic
  attacks for retrospective analysis of periods with increased levels of air
  pollution. Here, morbidity characteristics and seasonal patterns of asthmatic
  attacks as registered from November 1988 to May 1991, will be presented only.
  With regard to age and sex the data show that more than half of all asthmatic
  attacks occurred in children 0-14 years of age. Males outweigh females by
  roughly two to one, but the distribution becomes more even after adolescence.
  These results are in accordance with the literature (Table 1). Whereas hospital
  beds (hospitalisations) are occupied by a growing number of patients suffering
  from asthma, especially in children hospitals, the referral rate of children
  with asthmatic attacks by primary car physicians has remained relatively steady
  over the past three years (Table 2). Thus, it can be inferred that asthma,
  while a major problem in the hospital, is dealt with successfully by
  practitioners in the primary care setting. This is to the contrary of
  international trends which show an increasing referral rate for asthma. A
  differential analysis of workload from asthmatic attacks for general
  practitioners, internists and paediatricians is directing toward a rising
  incidence of asthma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB: In a one year pilot project in Hamburg, the feasibility of a sentinel
  practice system was tested by paediatricians and the health officials. The
  items to be documented were four symptoms of possible allergic pathogenesis.
  The mean of contacts per practice and week was 42 for rhinitis, 9 for wheeze, 8
  for acute conjunctivitis and 4 for urticaria. Rhinitis, conjunctivitis and
  wheeze showed clear seasonal trends, but also shortterm peaks running against
  the seasonal trends were detectable. Seasonal covariations between symptoms and
  environmental parameters were strongest between wheeze, temperature and sulfur
  dioxide concentration of the air. But only a part of the wheeze-peaks followed
  peaks of temperature or sulfur dioxide. The implications of the feasibility
  study results for a long-term sentinel system in Hamburg are discussed.

AB: Since 1991 the MORBUS project is being conducted to establish and run a
  sentinel network of 100 general and paediatric practices in three regions of
  Germany. A number of health conditions have been and will be monitored
  consecutively with special emphasis on environmentally determined health
  problems. From March to June, 1991, 1054 contacts of 1- and 2-year-old children
  with expiratory wheezing were reported. Quality of these event data was
  assessed by means of internal completeness. Important clinical information was
  missing in about 10% of all cases without evidence for regional
  differentiations. Data quality by this criterion was better in first contact
  than in re-contact cases (9.7% vs 18.1% missing). Questions concerning the
  parents (allergies, smoking, education) were less frequently answered (up to
  24% missing) than questions of obvious medical relevance to the child.
  Completeness of parental information varied considerably between regions. There
  was no association between the medical specialty of the doctors and the quality
  of their data. In a longitudinal view, there was a slightly positive trend over
  time in the proportion of clinically incomplete case reports at borderline
  statistical significance (p = 0.057). Apart from these minor findings then,
  there was an overall good consistency of completeness in the MORBUS data on
  expiratory wheezing. By optimizing questionnaires and data transmission, it
  should be possible to increase the data quality even further.

AB: OBJECTIVES. We conducted sentinel surveillance in persons practicing
  behaviors known to transmit retroviruses to determine the US presence and
  extent of human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2). METHODS. Sentinel
  surveillance for HIV-2 was conducted by testing 31,533 anonymous blood
  specimens from patients at sexually transmitted disease clinics, injecting drug
  users at treatment centers, and clients at HIV counseling and testing sites in
  14 US cities where West African immigrants often settle. Specimens were tested
  by HIV-1 and HIV-2 whole virus and synthetic peptide enzyme immunoassay and
  confirmed by HIV-1 and HIV-2 Western blots. RESULTS. Nearly 10% of 31,533 sera
  were positive for HIV-1. Two heterosexual Black male sexually transmitted
  disease patients were infected with HIV-2. One of the HIV-2 positive specimens
  did not cross-react on HIV-1 enzyme immunoassay screening. One client had
  antibodies consistent with malarial infection in West Africa; the other, who
  had syphilis, did not have antibodies to malaria or to any of 20 arboviruses
  present in Africa. CONCLUSIONS. Clinics serving clients from HIV-2 endemic
  areas should test persons practicing risk behaviors for both HIV-1 and HIV-2.
  Sentinel surveillance for HIV-2 serves as an early warning system for the
  possible spread of this virus in the United States.

AB: BACKGROUND: Pesticide exposures have clinical, epidemiological, legal, and
  political ramifications that go beyond the confines of a physician's office.
  The examination of the employee who has been exposed to a pesticide should be
  undertaken in an organized and methodical manner so that specific questions of
  causality can be answered and treatment can be initiated. METHODS: Five
  representative case studies illustrate different circumstances in which a
  pesticide injury can be seen in the office setting. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A
  wide range of pesticides is used in business and home, and the dangers of
  misdiagnosis, maldiagnosis, underdiagnosis, and overdiagnosis are especially
  common given the variety of chemicals used. The exposed employee must be
  removed from the source of exposure. Complete decontamination is a primary
  concern, and patients with unstable vital signs will need to be hospitalized. A
  methodical office examination, however, can be carried out on many exposed
  employees. A detailed description of the circumstances of the exposure should
  be elicited, and the chemical implicated in the exposure should be researched.
  A pesticide exposure is a sentinel event in the life of a patient and also
  suggests that other employees can be exposed. Such an exposure needs to be
  carefully assessed and documented, and proper treatment must be rendered.
  Further, the exposure can represent the first of many other exposures that
  might or might not be reported. Proper notification of authorities can limit
  exposures before they become severe.

AB: OBJECTIVES. Reported cases of building-related asthma and hypersensitivity
  pneumonitis among workers in a Denver office building prompted an epidemiologic
  investigation. METHODS. A cross-sectional, self-administered survey of
  employees in the office building of the reported cases was compared with that
  of employees in a comparison building. RESULTS. A significant excess of
  respiratory disease existed among 512 Denver workers (case building) compared
  with 281 office workers in a suburban agency (control building). Denver
  employees had a higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms, and the prevalence
  of physician-diagnosed asthma with onset or exacerbation since building
  occupancy was 4.9 times greater for Denver employees than for suburban
  employees. Asthma was not associated with any particular ventilation system in
  the building. Water incursion from a below-grade wall may have contributed to
  the problem, but the etiology is unknown. CONCLUSIONS. This investigation
  provided evidence of office building-related asthma. Individual cases may be
  sentinel events for other cases of work-related asthma or hypersensitivity
  pneumonitis and may indicate a need for public health investigation of
  remediable causes.

AB: Field and laboratory experiments were conducted during an epizootic of
  Coelomomyces punctatus (Chytridiomycetes: Blastocladiales) in a population of
  the mosquito Anopheles quadrimaculatus in a North Carolina farm pond to examine
  the interactions of several potential copepod hosts with the mosquito and
  fungus. The diel vertical migratory behavior of the copepod species
  Acanthocyclops robustus, Eucyclops serrulatus, Macrocyclops albidus, and
  Mesocyclops edax were monitored in relation to infection rates in sentinel
  mosquito larvae. Mosquito infection occurred primarily around dusk, the same
  period during which A. robustus and E. serrulatus were most abundant near the
  surface of the pond. However, exposure of A. robustus, E. serrulatus, M.
  albidus, M. edax, Microcyclops varicans, and Paracyclops poppei to fungal
  meiospores in the laboratory showed that only A. robustus and M. edax were
  competent intermediate hosts for C. punctatus. Laboratory studies of the diel
  periodicity of gametangial dehiscence in A. robustus and M. edax infected with
  C. punctatus revealed that gamete release and zygote formation also occurred
  around dusk. The combined results of the laboratory and field studies on
  copepod abundance, susceptibility to infection, and periodicity of gametangial
  dehiscence suggest that A. robustus was the principal intermediate host for C.
  punctatus during the epizootic, though it is probable that M. edax also
  contributed importantly to the overall rate of larval infection.

AB: A biomonitoring protocol, using blood cholinesterase (ChE) activity in
  livestock as a monitor of potential organophosphate nerve agent exposure during
  the planned destruction of US unitary chemical warfare agent stockpiles, is
  described. The experimental design included analysis of blood ChE activity in
  individual healthy sheep, horses, and dairy and beef cattle during a 10- to 12
  -month period. Castrated and sexually intact males, pregnant and lactating
  females, and adult and immature animals were examined through at least one
  reproductive cycle. The same animals were used throughout the period of
  observation and were not exposed to ChE-inhibiting organophosphate or carbamate
  compounds. A framework for an effective biomonitoring protocol within a
  monitoring area includes establishing individual baseline blood ChE activity
  for a sentinel group of 6 animals on the bases of blood samples collected over
  a 6-month period, monthly collection of blood samples for ChE-activity
  determination during monitoring, and selection of adult animals as sentinels.

AB: The use of Chironomidae in the biomonitoring of fresh waters is reviewed.
  Examples are given for levels of organization from organism to ecosystem, and a
  separate consideration is devoted to toxicity studies. Morphological
  deformities and life-history responses of Chironomidae to contaminants are
  common organism-level indicators. At the species-assemblage level, the classic
  lake trophic classification scheme, its contemporary derivatives, and
  paleolimnological approaches have been used extensively. Chironomidae also are
  essential components of quantitative and qualitative (rapid assessment)
  community approaches to biomonitoring. Examples of chironomids as components of
  ecosystem-level studies are rare, but even the few studies done show their
  value for this purpose. In toxicity testing, Chironomidae frequently are used
  in single species acute, single species chronic, and multispecies tests for a
  variety of stressors; Chironomidae could be used profitability in any expansion
  of toxicity testing involving macroinvertebrates. The review indicated that
  more emphasis on Chironomidae is required in studies of biochemical and
  physiological indicators of contaminants (organism level), and on Chironomidae
  as sentinel organisms (population level). Extensive use of Chironomidae in
  biomonitoring of fresh waters is consistent with the abundance and taxa
  richness of this group in natural habitats.

  damage may be avaluated through the incidence of "sentinel" negative
  reproductive events, such as sterility, spontaneous abortion, low birth weight,
  perinatal and infant mortality, congenital defects, childhood tumors. After
  examining the evidence that justifies the hypothesis of a causative association
  between these events and environmental exposures, the paper discusses the
  methodological problems involved in the use of the above "sentinel" events. The
  paper concludes with a state of the art review including results of recent
  research on the theme, conducted by the author.

AB: Experiments were conducted to establish the suitability of the seagrass
  Zostera muelleri as a sentinel accumulator for copper in shallow coastal waters
  and estuaries. A technique was developed for partitioning the environment of
  intact aquatic plants, so that uptake and translocation of copper within Z.
  muelleri could be monitored in a flow-through system. Plants were supplied with
  a range of copper concentrations, ranging from those found naturally in the
  environment to levels indicative of severe pollution. After 7 days in the
  partitioned system, root, stem, and leaf sections were analysed for copper
  content. It was found that the leaves of Z. muelleri accumulated copper to a
  greater extent than the root-rhizome component. There was little or no increase
  in the stem section of the plants, indicating minimal translocation of copper
  within the plant. The copper levels found in the plants reflect the ambient
  concentration of copper in the aquatic environment. Plants were collected from
  Hopkins Estuary, Warrnambool, Australia.

  selected for further review. outpatient charts of patients discharged for each
  diagnosis were abstracted with regard to I/O information and the discharged
  patients were interviewed by telephone to obtain a lifetime occupational
  history. The accuracy of the I/O information obtained from the hospital chart
  was compared to that obtained by patient interview by number of digits matched
  on standard classification codes. The frequencies of matches for occupation and
  industry were greater for "usual" than for "last" categories with both cancer
  diagnoses, but were similar for "usual" and "last" categories with toxic

AB: Workers, managers, and occupational health and safety inspectors can be
  trained to detect or recognize and promote action to correct sentinel markers
  for industrial disasters. A sentinel marker is defined as a pre-disaster
  warning sign of impending failure in prevention. Administrative sentinel
  markers are: a weak occupational health and safety program; lack of spontaneous
  access to top management; failure to accept responsibility for subcontractors;
  the absence of written disaster plans and drills for emergency response in the
  factory and the adjacent community; noninvestigation of prodromal leaks,
  exposures, spills or injuries; punishment of "troublesome" individuals
  reporting such prodromal events; nonuse or misuse of data on illness, injury
  and absenteeism; and suboptimal work conditions and supervision of shift
  workers. Information sentinel markers include absence of worker and community
  right-to-know programs, nonuse of data on earlier mishaps from similar
  technologies, and failure to provide toxicologic data to hospitals in the pre
  -disaster phase. Technological sentinel markers are: absence of fail-safe
  controls, interlocks and automated alarm systems driven by real-time
  monitoring. Transportation sentinel markers include suboptimal vehicle
  standards, and drink, drugs and fatigue in drivers. Preventive programs based
  on identification of all sentinel markers by workers are suggested to be more
  effective than selective action based on risk assessment analysis.

AB: Primary care physicians have an increasingly important role in identifying
  occupational and environmental (O/E) disease. However, the basic skills in O/E
  history taking, diagnosis, and management have not been adequately incorporated
  into traditional American medical education or practice. Reasons for these
  educational barriers are discussed. A new approach to O/E history taking, based
  on a modified list of occupational sentinel health events, is described. This
  list will give medical students and residents a practical, directed approach to
  recognizing O/E conditions and evaluating exposures in formulating a
  differential diagnosis. Through improved detection and assessment on the part
  of primary care physicians, appropriate referrals to occupational health
  specialists can be made for further investigation and public health
  surveillance.

AB: Foodborne diseases, i.e. illnesses due to contaminated food, are one of the
  most widespread problems of the contemporary world. They are toxic or
  infectious by nature and are caused by agents which enter the body through the
  ingestion of contaminated food or water. These agents can be chemical like
  pesticide residues and toxic metals or biological like pathogenic
  microorganisms. Foods contaminated by biological agents are, however, the major
  cause of foodborne disease. Data recorded in different countries show that the
  incidence of some of these diseases has increased dramatically over the past
  few years, but because of under-reporting the data are of limited value and
  cannot be compared between countries. In most countries, individual cases of
  illness are usually not reported. A sentinel surveillance system, started as a
  pilot study in the Netherlands, was shown to be feasible for the registration
  of some foodborne infections. Based on this study, it can be estimated that
  each year Salmonella and Campylobacter cause respectively about 12,000 and
  25,000 cases of acute enteritis per million. Case-control studies clearly
  implicate poultry products as an important source of acute enteritis. New
  developments in food production and changing trends in food consumption lead to
  the emergence of new hazards. Additionally, because the population is aging and
  there has been an increase in the number of individuals with underlying
  diseases, the state of public health is deteriorating. Campylobacter,
  Salmonella enteritidis and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli are examples of
  microorganisms that have the opportunity to increase as a consequence of
  intensive husbandry. Listeria monocytogenes is an example of an organism that
  causes disease in immunosuppressed individuals.

AB: A biomonitoring protocol, using blood cholinesterase (ChE) activity in
  livestock as a monitor of potential organophosphate nerve agent exposure during
  the planned destruction of US unitary chemical warfare agent stockpiles, is
  described. The experimental design included analysis of blood ChE activity in
  individual healthy sheep, horses, and dairy and beef cattle during a 10- to 12
  -month period. Castrated and sexually intact males, pregnant and lactating
  females, and adult and immature animals were examined through at least one
  reproductive cycle. The same animals were used throughout the period of
  observation and were not exposed to ChE-inhibiting organophosphate or carbamate
  compounds. A framework for an effective biomonitoring protocol within a
  monitoring area includes establishing individual baseline blood ChE activity
  for a sentinel group of 6 animals on the bases of blood samples collected over
  a 6-month period, monthly collection of blood samples for ChE-activity
  determination during monitoring, and selection of adult animals as sentinels.
  Exposure to ChE-inhibiting compounds would be suspected when all blood ChE
  activity of all animals within the sentinel group are decreased greater than
  20% from their own baseline value. Sentinel species selection is primarily a
  logistical and operational concern; however, sheep appear to be the species of
  choice because within-individual baseline ChE activity and among age and gender
  group ChE activity in sheep had the least variability, compared with data from
  other species. This protocol provides an effective and efficient means for
  detecting abnormal depressions in blood ChE activity in livestock and can serve
  as a valuable indicator of the extent of actual plume movement and/or
  deposition in the event of organophosphate nerve agent release.

AB: OBJECTIVE--To assess the extent of the human immunodeficiency virus
  (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic in the District of
  Columbia and demonstrate an approach to monitoring HIV infection and projecting
  AIDS incidence at a community level. DESIGN--Backcalculation methods to
  reconstruct HIV incidence from AIDS incidence in subgroups. Results were
  compared with directly measured HIV seroprevalence in selected sentinel
  populations: childbearing women, civilian applicants for military service, and
  hospital patients admitted for conditions unrelated to HIV infection. RESULTS-
  -Between the start of the epidemic in 1980 and January 1, 1991, one in 57
  District of Columbia men aged 20 to 64 years was diagnosed with AIDS. Unlike
  the plateau projected for the nation, AIDS incidence for the District of
  Columbia was projected to increase by 34% between 1990 and 1994. Models of HIV
  infection incidence suggested two broad epidemic waves of approximately equal
  size. The first occurred in men who have sex with men and peaked during the
  period from 1982 through 1983. The second began in the mid-1980s in injecting
  drug users and heterosexuals. We estimated that among District of Columbia
  residents aged 20 to 64 years, 0.3% of white women, 2.9% of white men, 1.6% of
  black women, and 4.9% of black men were living with HIV infection as of January
  1, 1991. These estimates are broadly consistent with survey data: among black
  childbearing women in their 20s, HIV prevalence doubled to 2% between the fall
  of 1989 and the spring of 1991; from military applicant data, we estimated that
  over 5% of black men born from 1951 through 1967 were HIV-positive; in the
  sentinel hospital, HIV prevalence rates among male patients aged 25 to 34 years
  were 11.3% in white men and 16.9% in black men. CONCLUSION--Backcalculation and
  surveys yielded quantitatively consistent estimates of HIV prevalence. Many
  injecting drug users and heterosexuals in the District of Columbia were
  infected after January 1, 1986. Similar monitoring of the epidemic in other
  localities is needed to focus efforts to reduce the incidence of HIV
  transmission.

AB: The alveolar macrophage (AM) is the sentinel immune cell of the distal
  airspace of the lung. These mononuclear phagocytic cells represent the major
  host defense against inhaled environmental agents. When activated, the AM has
  the capacity to release reactive oxygen and arachidonic acid metabolites and
  produce a number of cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1). This latter
  cytokine has pleiotropic effects on a variety of cells and has been implicated
  as one of the preeminent mediators of acute inflammation. Recently, an IL-1
  receptor antagonist (IRAP) has been isolated, purified, and cloned from
  peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) stimulated with either adherent IgG (adhIgG)
  lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or phorbol myristate acetate. IRAP acts as a true
  receptor antagonist without agonist activity. We postulated that the AM would
  be a significant cellular source of IRAP from the lung. To test this
  hypothesis, normal human AM were immediately isolated or stimulated in a dose
  -dependent fashion with either LPS or adhIgG. For comparison, PBM were also
  isolated and treated in a similar manner. PBM expressed steady-state IRAP mRNA
  by Northern blot analysis only in response to LPS or adhIgG. In contrast, AM
  were found to express significant levels of antigenic IRAP by Western blot
  analysis, immunostaining, and specific ELISA, and express steady-state levels
  of IRAP mRNA under unstimulated culture conditions. Moreover, LPS or adhIgG
  failed to induce AM-derived IRAP antigen generation over unstimulated
  control.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB: To assess the feasibility of using hospital records for occupational disease
  surveillance and to evaluate the quality of the industry/occupation (I/O)
  information available in these records, the computer file of all discharge
  diagnoses from a large health maintenance organization during 1985 was
  reviewed. The frequencies of discharge diagnoses previously listed as Sentinel
  Health Events (Occupational), or SHE (O), were calculated and three possible
  SHE(O) diagnoses--lung cancer, bladder cancer, and toxic hepatitis--were
  selected for further review. Outpatient charts of patients discharged for each
  diagnosis were abstracted with regard to I/O information and the discharged
  patients were interviewed by telephone to obtain a lifetime occupational
  history. The accuracy of the I/O information obtained from the hospital chart
  was compared to that obtained by patient interview by number of digits matched
  on standard classification codes. The frequencies of matches for occupation and
  industry were greater for "usual" than for "last" categories with both cancer
  diagnoses, but were similar for "usual" and "last" categories with toxic
  hepatitis. To assess the proportion of each possible SHE(O) diagnosis that was
  related to workplace exposures, the I/O information obtained by interview was
  rated in a blinded fashion by an experienced occupational medicine physician.
  The highest probability ratings for work-relatedness were noted for lung
  cancer, primarily due to asbestos exposure. The results of this study suggest
  that hospital records can be used to identify possible SHE(O); if adequate I/O
  information is available, then work-relatedness can be assessed. However, the
  accuracy of I/O obtained from hospital charts is relatively low. The efficient
  and accurate collection of I/O information from hospital records will require
  the use of a simple, easily coded instrument to be routinely administered on
  admission.

AB: Squamous-cell carcinoma of the scrotum has a poor prognosis unless locally
  confined. Patients with stage A1 disease have approximately a 75% or better
  chance for long-term survival. Occupation-related and -induced scrotal
  carcinomas are less frequent now because of better hygiene, protective
  clothing, and awareness of the carcinogenicity of industrial oils. A rise in
  the incidence of the disease might result from the HPV epidemic. The basic
  treatment of squamous-cell carcinomas of the scrotum still depends on wide
  local excision of the primary lesion. Patients should be treated with a broad
  -spectrum antibiotic for 4 to 6 weeks prior to sentinel node biopsy or
  ilioinguinal lymphadenectomy. Sentinel node biopsy should be performed to rule
  out micrometastasis and to establish the need for a formal ilioinguinal
  lymphadenectomy. Radiation therapy has little therapeutic benefit in the
  management of squamous-cell carcinoma of the scrotum. Bleomycin might be useful
  as adjuvant therapy for widespread ilioinguinal disease before attempted
  resection, although this has yet to be proved.

AB: BACKGROUND. Intravenous drug use has played a key role in the human
  immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic. Standardized surveillance of HIV
  infection among intravenous drug users (IVDUs) is needed to determine HIV
  prevalence rates, to monitor changes in prevalence over time, and to describe
  behaviors associated with HIV infection. METHODS. In 1987, the Centers for
  Disease Control began collaborating with state and local health departments to
  conduct a national program of HIV seroprevalence surveys in a variety of
  populations and settings. This program includes unlinked HIV seroprevalence
  surveys in IVDUs entering sentinel drug treatment programs. RESULTS. From April
  1988 through December 1989, annual studies were completed in 59 drug treatment
  centers in 33 US cities. Center-specific seroprevalence rates ranged from 0% to
  48.2%, with a median of 4.6%. HIV seroprevalence rates varied widely by
  geographic area, with rates highest in the Northeast, intermediate in the
  Middle Atlantic cities of Baltimore and Washington, DC, and lower in other
  parts of the country. Median rates were 15.6% among African Americans, 3.2%
  among Hispanics, and 3.3% among Whites. CONCLUSIONS. Intravenous drug use is
  likely to remain an important factor in HIV transmission. This study supports
  the need to develop or expand programs to prevent the further introduction and
  spread of HIV among IVDUs and to prevent HIV transmission to their sexual
  partners.

  commonly relies on computerized analyses of mortality data obtained from vital
  statistics records. A computer search of death records in the District of
  Columbia for the period 1980 to 1987 identified 15 cases that noted asbestosis,
  silicosis, coal worker's pneumoconiosis, or primary cancer of the
  pleura/mesothelioma as the underlying cause of death. A manual review of the
  death certificates for the same period identified three times as many cases (n
  = 48) with any mention of these conditions. Problems with performing
  surveillance of these events using death certificates include the lack of
  sufficient information to identify mesotheliomas and the failure to code and
  computerize all contributing causes of death.

AB: Pesticide exposure in the population of callers to Minnesota [USA] Regional
  Poison Centers is described. Case files from 1988 reporting pesticide exposure
  to humans were identified in cooperation with the Minnesota Center for Health
  Statistics. Data analysis was conducted by computer using SAS statistical
  package. Of the 1428 case files indicating pesticide as the primary substance
  of exposure in Minnesota residents, a mean age of 5 yr (range, 1 month to 85
  yr) was identified; 50% of all cases were below age 3 yr. Males accounted for
  1.3X as many cases as females. Insecticide was identified in the largest
  percentage of case files (74%), followed by herbicide (12%), rodenticide (11%)
  and fungicide-nonmedicinal (3%). Ingestion was the most common route of
  exposure; 85% of all calls originated from a residence. While insecticides are
  still the most common type of pesticide call, herbicide has surpassed
  insecticide in production and sales in the USA. In this study, herbicide type
  exposure calls present a different picture from other pesticide types. The
  usefulness of poison control centres for examination of pesticide poisoning is
  explored. Since reporting occurs coincidental with the exposure and its
  associated symptoms, each pesticide poisoning report could potentially serve as
  a true sentinel health event.

AB: Seasonal transmission of Fasciola hepatica was observed in sentinel sheep
  and the dynamics of the snail intermediate host, Lymnaea truncatula, was
  followed over a 3-year study period in the Middle-Atlas mountains in Morocco.
  High fluke burdens were recorded in both lambs and ewes in the fall and winter,
  suggesting that transmission occurred in late spring. Fluke burdens ranged from
  one to 302 in ewes and from one to 345 in lambs. Infections with 200 or more
  flukes were always fatal. A unique feature of this study was the annual
  cyclical fluctuation of the fluke burdens. Burdens reached maximum levels
  during the winter and then declined to low numbers by late spring and summer.
  This suggested self-regulation which may be dependent on breed resistance or
  may be related to forage factors, including lack of forage (nutritional
  stress). Snail populations were cyclical and correlated with fluke transmission
  as observed in the sentinel sheep. The weather was observed to affect the snail
  populations which in turn limited fluke transmission. (DBO)

  hepatocytes in the white perch Morone americana . Vacuolated cell lesions have
  been reported from a number of species in association with degraded habitats,
  often in the presence of hepatic neoplasms. Extensive atypical vacuolated cell
  lesions assuming characteristic acinar or ductular configurations have been
  reported previously only from the winter flounder Pseudopleuronectes americanus
  . Light microscopic findings, utilizing a variety of histochemical stains,
  suggest the identical nature of this lesion to that of winter flounder. The
  discovery of this lesion in a free-swimming species, feeding throughout the
  water column, is in direct contrast to that of the bottom dwelling
  pleuronectid, feeding from and constantly in contact with potentially
  contaminated sediments. While the winter flounder has become the sentinel fish
  species for pollution monitoring on the northeast coast, increased surveillance
  of other species may prove atypical vacuolated cell lesions represent a common
  mechanism of chronic cellular injury in relation to impacted environments.

AB: We investigated the feasibility of using hospital discharge diagnoses of ICD
  codes 506, 507, and 508, respiratory diseases from external sources, to
  identify occupational sentinel health events (SHE(O)). Two hundred sixty-nine
  records were reviewed and 66 (25%) were incidents where the work-relatedness of
  the respiratory diseases was documented in the medical records. Twenty-six
  percent of the 269 records contained no exposure information. Sixty-four of the
  66 occupational cases were from ICD codes 506.0 - 506.9, with the largest
  number classified as ICD codes 506.0 (bronchitis and pneumonitis due to fumes
  and vapors) and 506.3 (other acute and subacute respiratory conditions due to
  fumes and vapors). We conclude that surveillance of ICD codes in the 506
  series, where 39% of the cases were secondary to occupational exposures, is a
  valuable component of a surveillance system for preventable occupational lung
  disease.

AB: The occurrence of mesothelioma is a sentinel event in occupational and
  environmental disease. A mesothelioma surveillance system was established
  utilizing existing computerized Wisconsin vital statistics data maintained
  since 1959 and a Cancer Reporting System (CRS) established in 1978. Review of
  the death certificate listing of usual occupation and industry from 487
  mesothelioma deaths in Wisconsin from 1959 to 1989 led to the investigation of
  41 persons with likely exposure to inplace asbestos-containing building
  materials (ACBM): 12 school teachers, 10 school maintenance employees, 7 public
  building maintenance workers, 5 private building maintenance workers, and 7
  commercial and factory workers performing maintenance activities. For 10 (34%)
  of the 29 maintenance workers the only source of asbestos exposure identified
  was their maintenance work. For five (17%) histories indicated some prior
  employment in occupations and industries with probable asbestos exposures.
  Opportunities for indirect occupational exposure were identified for ten who
  had been employed in the residential construction industry. One maintenance
  worker was exposed to asbestos in the household and another had neighborhood
  exposure. For 9 (75%) of the school teachers, the only identifiable potential
  source of asbestos exposure was derived from in-place ACBM in schools. One
  teacher had spent a season in the merchant marine aboard an iron ore-hauling
  ship and 2 had worked in the residential construction industry. Two of the
  teachers were sisters, and in two instances, two teachers had taught in the
  same school facility. We conclude that individuals occupationally exposed to in
  -place ACBM are at risk for the subsequent development of mesothelioma.

AB: A total of 21 consecutive patients who underwent surgery for carpal tunnel
  syndrome in a regional hospital were analysed for their trade and serum alpha 1
  -antitrypsin phenotypes. The majority of these cases were women and mostly
  manual trades and professions were involved. Furthermore, heterozygous
  antitrypsin phenotypes were more frequent among the surgical cases than among
  the general Swiss population. In a second stage, the incidence of carpal tunnel
  syndrome in Switzerland was studied for 1 year from June 1988 through May 1989
  using the sentinel system developed by the Federal Office of Public Health
  Administration. In all, 188 cases were found, most of whom were women, which
  was compatible with the frequency in other countries. A complementary
  questionnaire that was filled out by 65 cases and their matched controls showed
  that housewives and shop clerks were overrepresented among the patients.
  Likewise, exposure to vibrating tools and frequent extensions and/or flexions
  of the wrist were mentioned more often by the cases than by the controls. The
  present study confirms previous findings that women are at greater risk of
  developing carpal tunnel syndrome especially in jobs requiring repetitive
  movements or operation of vibrating tools. A constitutional element in
  pathogenesis was suggested by observations that the mothers of the cases had
  often also been afflicted with carpal tunnel syndrome and that the frequency of
  distribution of antitrypsin phenotypes in patients differed from that in the
  general population.

AB: The purpose of this study was to identify the strengths and limitations of
  using portable peak flowmeters to document suspected cases of occupational
  asthma that were reported to a statewide surveillance project. The New Jersey
  Department of Health conducts surveillance for occupational asthma as part of
  the federally sponsored Sentinel Event Notification System for Occupational
  Risks (SENSOR). Between May 1988 and January 1990, 70 cases were reported
  voluntarily by physicians. Subjects who were still employed in suspected work
  sites were requested to test themselves for at least 15 days, using portable
  peak flowmeters to generate serial measurements of their peak expiratory flow
  rate (PEFR). For each of the 14 subjects who were successfully tested, the PEFR
  data provided valuable information about their asthma-work association.
  However, a large number of subjects whose cases were reported (56) either could
  not be tested or were not successfully tested. The proportion of subjects
  completing the test would probably improve if it were conducted when their
  conditions were first diagnosed. Accordingly, the collection of serial peak
  flow measurements to document occupational asthma would best be initiated by
  the treating physician when the patient first sought care, rather than waiting
  until after the case was reported to the state health department.

  monitor the HIV epidemic by testing subgroups of the population, and such
  testing has been carried out at the Murray Street Clinic in Perth, Western
  Australia since August 1989. This clinic is part of the State Health Department
  and is dedicated to the diagnosis, management and control of sexually
  transmitted diseases (STDs) in Western Australia. Sentinel testing at this
  clinic is both voluntary and confidential. In the first 6 months of testing at
  the clinic, 2351 new patients were seen and 3000 HIV antibody tests were
  performed. The refusal rate for participation was 8%. No patient tested as a
  sentinel test or because of multiple heterosexual partners was HIV antibody
  positive. The first 6 months of sentinel testing at the Murray Street Clinic
  does not indicate a silent HIV infection in the self-selected sexually active
  group of people using the facilities of the clinic.

AB: The genetic consequences of radioactive fall-out deposition from the

  The surveillance is based on three groups of indicator conditions: 15 sentinel
  anomalies (indicators of germinal dominant gene mutations), Down's syndrome (an
  indicator of germinal numerical and structural chromosomal mutations) and
  unidentified multiple congenital abnormalities (indicators of germinal dominant
  gene and chromosomal mutations). Cases with these indicator conditions were
  selected from the material of the Hungarian Congenital Abnormality Registry.
  After the diagnostic accuracies were checked, familial and sporadic cases were
  separated. Only the latter group was evaluated for evidence of new mutations.
  The analysis did not reveal any measurable germinal mutagenic effects of the
  Chernobyl accident. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the
  rates of these three groups of indicator conditions between regions with higher
  and lower increased background radiation.

AB: A patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus developed fatal
  aortoesophageal (AE) fistula following a preoperative course of combined
  chemotherapy plus radiation therapy. This is the first reported case of AE
  fistula following preoperative chemoradiotherapy. This complication is
  potentially correctable if suspected early, since the massive hemorrhage
  characteristic of AE fistula is usually preceded by an initial sentinel
  hemorrhage. The cause of this complication is not clear, but it may be due to
  inflammation of the vasa vasorum with necrosis of the aortic wall. The
  concomitant use of fluorouracil and cisplatin with radiation therapy acts as a
  radiosensitizer and may have potentiated the radiation effect on the aortic
  wall.

AB: The U.S. Coast Guard has developed a Coast Guard-wide comprehensive system
  for surveillance of workplace diseases. The American Medical Association's
  fifth edition of the Current Medical Information and Terminology (CMIT) was
  used as a reference to expand the basic list of 50 Sentinel Health Events
  (Occupational) [SHE(O)] published by the National Institute of Occupational
  Health and Safety (NIOSH), September, 1983. The expanded list of 107 sentinel
  events serves as a framework for the development of a computerized system of
  occupational health surveillance in the U.S. Coast Guard. This application of
  SHE(O) surveillance can have application in the early detection and prevention
  of environmental diseases.

AB: Previous studies have demonstrated that dietary administration of the
  schistosomicidal drug 5-(2-pyrazinyl)-4-methyl-1,2-dithiole-3-thione (oltipraz)
  ameliorates the hepatotoxicity of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). Notably, mortality,
  altered hepatic function, hepatic AFB1-DNA adduct levels, and expression of
  hepatic enzyme-altered foci were markedly reduced in the rat by concurrent
  feeding of oltipraz during exposures to AFB1. Collectively, these studies
  prompted us to evaluate the chemoprotective properties of oltipraz against AFB1
  -induced liver cancer. In addition, preliminary molecular dosimetry studies
  were undertaken to determine the utility of measurements of urinary aflatoxin
  -N7-guanine excretion as a marker of relative risk for hepatocarcinogenesis in
  AFB1-exposed rats. For the carcinogenesis studies, 5-wk-old male F344 rats were
  randomly divided into two groups. One group (55 rats) received the AIN-76A
  diet, and the other group (56 rats) received the AIN-76A diet supplemented with
  0.075% oltipraz. The oltipraz-supplemented diet was fed for 4 wk. Beginning 1
  wk after starting the experimental diets, all rats in both groups received 25
  micrograms of AFB1/rat/day by gavage for 5 days per wk over the next 2 wk. One
  wk following cessation of dosing with AFB1, oltipraz was removed from the diet,
  and all rats were fed the AIN-76A diet for the remainder of the experiment. At
  3 mo after dosing, livers of ten sentinel rats from each group were analyzed
  for the burden of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase-positive foci. In accord with
  previous findings, rats fed the oltipraz-supplemented diet exhibited
  substantial reductions in the focal burden (97% reduction; P less than 0.05) of
  these AFB1-induced lesions. The remaining rats were maintained for the cancer
  study until they became moribund or the termination of the experiment at 23 mo.
  Gross liver lesions were identified at autopsy and confirmed by microscopic
  evaluation. An 11% incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma was observed in the
  AFB1-treated, control diet-fed rats. An additional 9% of this group had
  hepatocellular adenomas. Oltipraz afforded complete protection against both
  AFB1-induced hepatocellular neoplasms. Using Kaplan-Meier survival analyses,
  rats in the oltipraz group had a significantly (P less than 0.02) longer life
  span and an increased survival free of liver tumors (P less than 0.0002).
  Molecular dosimetry studies used rats fed either the oltipraz-supplemented or
  control diet for 1 wk and then challenged with a single dose of AFB1 to examine
  the initial rates of 8,9-dihydro-8-(N7-guanyl)-9-hydroxyaflatoxin B1 excreted
  in the urine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

  reflection of the accident at the Chernobyl reactor. The different congenital
  abnormality entities and the components of fetal radiation syndrome did not
  show a higher rate after the Chernobyl accident in the data-set of the
  Hungarian Congenital Abnormality Registry. Among confounding factors, the rate
  of induced abortions did not increase after the Chernobyl accident in Hungary.
  In the 9th month after the peak of public concern (May and June, 1986) the rate
  of livebirths decreased. Three indicator conditions: 15 sentinel anomalies as
  indicators of germinal dominant gene mutations, Down syndrome as an indicator
  of germinal numerical and structural chromosomal mutations, and unidentified
  multiple congenital abnormalities as indicators of germinal dominant gene and
  chromosomal mutations were selected from the material of the Hungarian
  Congenital Abnormality Registry. Diagnoses were checked, familial and sporadic
  cases were separated and only the sporadic cases were evaluated. The analysis
  of indicator conditions did not reveal any measurable germinal mutagenic effect
  of the Chernobyl accident in Hungary.

AB: An occupational sentinel health event (SHE[O]) is a disease, disability, or
  untimely death, which is occupationally related and whose occurrence may: 1)
  provide the impetus for epidemiologic or industrial hygiene studies; or 2)
  serve as a warning signal that materials substitution, engineering control,
  personal protection, or medical care may be required. Following survey of
  scientific literature, a list of 50 disease conditions linked to the workplace
  was presented in 1983; these were codable within the framework of the
  International Classification of Diseases system (ICD-9). Three criteria were
  used for inclusion: documentation of associated agent(s), of involved
  industries, and of involved occupations. The up-dated list contains 64 diseases
  or conditions and a bibliography of literature citations. The list is useful
  for the practicing physician in occupational disease recognition, for
  occupational morbidity and mortality surveillance, and as a periodically up
  -dated database of occupationally related diseases.

AB: Environmental scientists and managers must determine whether a relationship
  between an environmental factor and an observed effect is causal and respond
  accordingly. Epidemiologists have, over the past 150 yr, developed a systematic
  approach to evaluating these relationships. Their criteria for objectively
  evaluating the relationship between a suspect cause and a chronic disease are
  (1) probability, (2) time order, (3) strength of association, (4) specificity,
  (5) consistency on replication, (6) predictive performance, and (7) coherence.
  These criteria can be used, with little modification, to evaluate associations
  in relation to diseases in fish and wildlife suspected to be caused by exposure
  to chemical pollutants. Some populations of fish and wildlife are members of
  the same guilds as subpopulations of humans. Investigations of chemically
  induced disease in these sentinel populations of fish and wildlife may identify
  the potential risks posed to these human subpopulations. Evidence evaluated
  using the epidemiologic criteria may assist environmental managers to determine
  whether a substantive case can be made to initiate preventative or remedial
  action. By applying the null hypothesis, scientists are forced to consider how
  much information must be ignored to conclude that a causal relationship does
  not exist.

AB: We investigated the feasibility of using hospital discharge diagnoses of ICD
  codes 506, 507, and 508, respiratory diseases from external sources, to
  identify occupational sentinel health events [SHE(O)]. Two hundred sixty-nine
  records were reviewed and 66 (25%) were incidents where the work-relatedness of
  the respiratory diseases was documented in the medical records. Twenty-six
  percent of the 269 records contained no exposure information. Sixty-four of the
  66 occupational cases were from ICD codes 506.0-506.9, with the largest number
  classified as ICD codes 506.0 (bronchitis and pneumonitis due to fumes and
  vapors) and 506.3 (other acute and subacute respiratory conditions due to fumes
  and vapors). We conclude that surveillance of ICD codes in the 506 series,
  where 39% of the cases were secondary to occupational exposures, is a valuable
  component of a surveillance system for preventable occupational lung disease.

AB: The purpose of this study is to describe pesticide exposure in the
  population of callers to Minnesota Regional Poison Centers. Case files from
  1988 reporting pesticide exposure to humans were identified in cooperation with
  the Minnesota Center for Health Statistics. Data analysis was conducted by
  computer using SAS statistical package. Of the 1,428 case files indicating
  pesticide as the primary substance of exposure to Minnesota residents, a mean
  age of 5 years (range, one month to 85 years) was identified; 50 percent of all
  cases were below age 3 years. Males accounted for 1.3 times as many cases as
  females. Insecticide was identified in the largest percentage of case files (74
  percent) followed by herbicide (12 percent), rodenticide (11 percent) and
  fungicide-nonmedicinal (3 percent). Ingestion was the most common route of
  exposure; 85 percent of all calls originated from a residence. While
  insecticides are still the most common types of pesticide call, herbicide has
  surpassed insecticide in production and sales in the US. In this study,
  herbicide type exposure calls present a much different picture than other
  pesticide types. The usefulness of poison control centers for examination of
  pesticide poisoning is explored. Since reporting occurs coincidental with the
  exposure and its associated symptoms, each pesticide poisoning report could
  potentially serve as a true sentinel health event.

  workers in utility companies (10.0/100,000), mining (5.9/100,000), and
  construction industries (3.9/100,000), but these high risk groups accounted for
  only 50% of the deaths. Most accidental electrocutions resulted from power line
  contact (53%) and machine or tool usage or repair (22%). Only 1.5% (2/101) of
  the workers who died within 6 hours of injury and had blood alcohol
  concentration tested were legally intoxicated. All workers need safety
  education on active measures to prevent hazardous electrical exposures, not
  just those at high risk for electrical injury. Every work-related electrical
  injury represents a sentinel health event--an opportunity for preventive
  intervention in the workplace.

AB: One of the interests of ICPEMC is to identify situations in which the
  possible induction of inherited defects in man by mutagen exposure could
  actually be studied. The large-scale use of mutagenic drugs in field programmes
  against schistosomiasis, mainly during the 1970's, was considered a possible
  case. An ICPEMC task group approached the problem by (1) updating the genetic
  toxicology data base for antischistosomal drugs, and (2) reviewing possible
  study areas. Expertise was combined from genetic toxicology, mutation
  epidemiology and tropical medicine. It was considered that: (a) if any,
  hycanthone would be the most appropriate candidate drug for study; (b) it would
  be virtually impossible to meet the basic requirements of an appropriate
  mutation epidemiology study, in endemic countries; (c) as more defined genetic
  endpoints would be selected (e.g. sentinel phenotypes) the required large
  sample sizes would seem prohibitive, since documentation on past programmes is
  limited and local demography would render the reliable tracking of substantial
  numbers of offspring of treated persons an almost impossible task; (d) in most
  endemic countries proper diagnosis and registration of inherited defects is
  largely lacking; (e) the problems encountered in demonstrating inherited
  effects in humans after heavy or chronic exposure to established animal
  mutagens such as ionizing radiation and cancer chemotherapy, in combination
  with the ambiguous nature of the animal germ cell data with hycanthone, do not
  particularly warrant large expectations; (f) since non-mutagenic
  antischistosomal drugs are now in use, the problem is academic and of low
  priority in the endemic countries whose medical and research resources are
  often limited. Thus, studying offspring of hycanthone-treated people to
  demonstrate the mutagenic potential of the drug in man is not a viable
  enterprise.

  discussed with reference to: basic principles of the technique; the rapidity of
  flow cytometric techniques; high accuracy as a result of the large number of
  cells tested (e.g. 104); application of DNA- or RNA-specific stains to detect
  changes in nucleic acid content or cell cycle progression; use for detection of
  mutagenic, carcinogenic or clastogenic action of contaminants; and use for
  monitoring of `sentinel' animals to detect contaminants in the vicinity of

AB: Male lek display in birds may reduce nest-related predation by decoying
  predators away from nests and alerting incubating females when a predator is
  approaching. The sentinel/decoy model predicts a region of decreased predator
  density just inside the maximum range at which predators are attracted by
  displaying males. The expected ring of successful nests is evident in data from
  three species of North American prairie grouse. Well-documented features of
  female mate choice in lekking species, including repeated visits to male
  display sites prior to mating, mate fidelity and mate copying, are consistent
  with females maximizing the proposed antipredator benefit. The sentinel/decoy
  model makes a number of unique predictions that will facilitate critical tests

  is a useful indicator of the potential biological effect of the chemical if

  Using the earthworm Eisenia fetida (Savigny) as an indicator organism for soil
  ecosystems, concentrations of 10 organic chemicals were evaluated for sublethal
  effects on earthworm growth and reproduction. Following short-term exposure to
  sublethal concentrations of carbaryl and dieldrin, E. fetida was allowed to
  resume growth and reproduction to determine whether such effects were
  permanent. The effect on earthworm populations as a representative soil
  organism could be a sentinel for the effects of more destructive soil processes.

AB: Serologic evidence indicated that an episode of congenital abnormalities in
  sheep was caused by Cache Valley virus (CVV), a bunyavirus indigenous to the
  United States. To determine the teratogenic potential of CVV in sheep, fetuses
  were infected in utero between 27 and 54 days of gestation with an isolate (CK
  -102) obtained in 1987 from a sentinel sheep in San Angelo, Texas. The dams of
  these fetuses were euthanatized between 28 and 75 days after inoculation, and
  the fetuses were examined for malformations. Twenty-eight of 34 fetuses had
  congenital abnormalities, including arthrogryposis, hydranencephaly,
  mummification, reabsorption, and oligohydroamnion. Virus was isolated from the
  allantoic fluid of 11 of 17 fetuses euthanatized at less than 70 days of
  gestation. The virus-positive fetuses, which were all negative for CVV
  -neutralizing antibody, had lesions ranging from none to severe arthrogryposis
  and hydranencephaly. Virus was not recovered from the allantoic fluid of
  fetuses after 76 days' gestation when CVV-specific antibody could be detected
  in 5 of 8 fetuses examined. The 2 fetuses infected on days 50 and 54 of
  gestation appeared normal and 1 had antibody to CVV.

AB: Seroprevalence surveys of incoming inmates provide useful sentinel
  information on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection rates among groups
  that practice HIV-associated high-risk behaviors. In addition, such data are
  beneficial to corrections officials in the formulation of institutional
  policies to prevent HIV infection. Inmates entering the Michigan corrections
  system from December 1987 to March 1988 participated in blind, anonymous
  serosurveys for HIV infection. Eight of 802 entering inmates (1.0 percent) were
  seropositive; most seropositive persons reported intravenous drug use. The most
  common risk behaviors reported by study participants were intravenous drug use
  (20.0 percent), multiple sexual partners (37.1 percent), and infrequent (that
  is, never or seldom) use of condoms (82.6 percent). Women reported the highest
  rates of intravenous drug use (35.1 percent) and needle-sharing (19.4 percent).
  Results from this study indicate that in spite of wide-spread HIV-associated
  risk behaviors, the extent of HIV-seropositivity among incoming inmates in
  Michigan is relatively low. Such data suggest that there is still time to
  impact the course of the AIDS epidemic among high-risk groups in States where
  the prevalence of HIV infection is relatively low. The data also indicate that
  the potential for HIV spread in correctional facilities is noteworthy and that
  HIV prevention education and substance abuse treatment services are needed in
  corrections facilities.

AB: To date, no agent has been documented to cause germ cell mutation in human
  beings, with the possible exception of radiation causing abnormal meiotic
  chromosomes in testes. For studies in humans, mutation epidemiologists prefer
  the cohort approach, starting with an exposed population and looking for
  mutations that may be expressed in offspring as variants in health,
  chromosomes, proteins, or nucleic acids. Currently patients with cancer are the
  cohort exposed to the largest doses of potential mutagens, i.e., radiotherapy
  and drugs. In 12 large studies with over 825 patients and 1573 pregnancies, 46
  (4%) of 1240 liveborns had a major birth defect, a rate comparable to that in
  the general population. One of these was a classic sentinel phenotype, i.e., a
  new sporadic case of a dominant mendelian syndrome. In collaboration with 5
  U.S. cancer registries, we interviewed a retrospective cohort of 2383 patients
  diagnosed with cancer under age 20 years, from 1945 through 1975. Records were
  sought to verify major genetic disease, defined as a cytogenetic or single gene
  disorder or 1 of 15 isolated birth defects. In 2308 offspring of survivors, 5
  had a chromosomal syndrome, 11 had a single gene disorder, and 62 had at least
  one major malformation. Among 4722 offspring of sibling controls, the
  respective numbers were 7, 12, and 127, nonsignificant differences. 7% of the
  parents of the offspring with possibly new mutations received potentially
  mutagenic therapy, compared with 12% of parents of normal children. Since
  pregnancy in or by cancer survivors is still a rare event, future efforts to
  document germ cell mutation may be best studied through international
  cooperation coupled with diverse laboratory measures of mutation.

AB: The surveillance of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) through case
  reporting only reflects the epidemiologic features of HIV (human
  immunodeficiency virus) transmission a few years earlier and not the prevalence
  of HIV seropositivity. HIV infection is not a notifiable condition in Quebec.
  We were asked by the ministere de la Sante et des Services sociaux du Quebec to
  perform a pilot project for the surveillance of HIV seropositivity using a
  network of sentinel physicians. From May 15, 1988, to Sept. 30, 1989,
  physicians from four collaborating centres collected data on the serologic
  status, demographic characteristics and risk factors for 4209 patients who
  underwent HIV antibody testing. Of the 3899 subjects included in the study 7.9%
  were HIV positive. Through logistic regression analysis the following variables
  were found to be significantly associated with HIV seropositivity: presence of
  HIV-related symptoms (prevalence odds ratio [POR] 36.5), origin from an endemic
  area (POR 9.1), homosexuality or bisexuality (POR 8.4), intravenous drug use
  (POR 4.2), male sex (POR 2.8), previous HIV antibody testing (POR 2.5) and
  previous sexually transmitted disease (POR 1.8). Over the study period we found
  a large increase in HIV seroprevalence among intravenous drug users (4.2% in
  1988 to 19.0% in 1989) (p = 0.02). This increase might reflect a recent change
  in the epidemiologic pattern of HIV transmission in Quebec. Surveillance of HIV
  seropositivity through a network of sentinel physicians may be a reasonable
  alternative to mandatory reporting.

AB: Sharing of equipment used to inject illicit drugs intravenously is a risk
  factor for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired
  immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Systematic surveillance of HIV infection
  among intravenous drug users (IVDUs) in the United States is essential to
  monitor the HIV epidemic and to target and evaluate prevention programs for
  IVDUs and their partners. The most accessible segment of the largely covert
  population of IVDUs are those in drug treatment programs. In collaboration with
  State and local health departments and drug abuse treatment agencies, the
  Centers for Disease Control is conducting blinded (serologic test results not
  linked to identifiable persons) and nonblinded (in which clients voluntarily
  agree to participate) surveys of IVDUs entering drug treatment in 39 U.S.
  metropolitan areas. The same protocol is used in all participating drug
  treatment centers. Blinded surveys will be carried out annually to determine
  HIV seroprevalence rates in eligible IVDUs entering drug treatment and to
  monitor trends over time. Each year, nonblinded surveys of IVDUs entering drug
  treatment will assess self-reported drug use and sexual behaviors to help
  design educational interventions and to detect changes in behavior over time.
  This sentinel surveillance system, using a standardized methodology, will
  provide the best national and regional data available on the seroprevalence of
  HIV among IVDUs and the relationships of drug use, sexual behaviors, and HIV
  serologic status of IVDUs.

  treatment of the index case alone, with minimal attention to the public health
  implications of other exposed or ill workers, PCCs could serve as a national
  surveillance system for occupational illnesses, a system with both passive and

  indicator conditions of offspring are being followed, namely 15 sentinel
  anomalies, Down syndrome and unidentified multiple congenital abnormality. The
  latter is discussed here as a possible indicator of germinal dominant gene and
  chromosomal mutations. The component congenital abnormalities of unidentified
  multiple congenital abnormalities are classified into 45 groups. The component
  congenital abnormalities were reduced to pairs. A pair is a set of 2
  independent component congenital abnormalities in index patients with 2 or more
  congenital abnormalities. Baseline figures of all component congenital
  abnormality pairs in 3722 unidentified multiple congenital abnormalities were
  determined in the study period 1973-1982. The observed data for 1983 were
  compared with expected occurrences based on baseline figures. This pair-wise
  evaluation of component elements within unidentified multiple congenital
  abnormalities seems to be an adequate surveillance method to detect any time
  cluster of congenital abnormality pairs due to environmental factors including
  germinal mutagens.

  all SHE(O) deaths and 81 percent of matched SHE(O) deaths. The construction
  industry was associated with the vast majority of such deaths.

  the input of Sentinel General Practitioners (SGPs). From October 1986 to May
  1988, for each case of suicide or attempted suicide, the SGPs reported
  epidemiological data to our system through a computer network of personal home
  terminals (Minitels). Data included age, sex, method and result of attempt and
  antecedents. In an analysis of the relationship between the suicidal method,
  antecedents and results of suicidal act, the principal findings were a high
  rate of antecedents of suicide attempts by drug overdoses, hangings and
  drownings; and no antecedents for attempts by the use of firearms. This may
  show that the increasing accessibility of firearms is making it more likely
  that impulsive suicide attempts will be lethal.

  occupationally related. The present paper examines the feasibility of using
  this disease in active cancer surveillance in New York State. After consulting
  cancer case reports, hospital records, death certificates, and city
  directories, we obtained occupational data for 17 of 22 cases of nonmelanoma
  skin cancer of the scrotum diagnosed between 1979 and 1984. Only three cases
  had occupations previously linked to scrotal cancer, while 11 of 19 cases had
  one or more possibly contributory medical conditions. The probable under
  -reporting of scrotal cancer cases and incompleteness of occupational data may
  limit the usefulness of scrotal cancer as a sentinel health event

AB: An essential part of the process of providing safe drinking water is the
  monitoring of water before, during and after such treatment for the presence of
  potential microbial pathogens. These pathogens (eg Salmonella and Shigella),
  however, which originate in mammalian gut are difficult to isolate from water.
  This is because they are present in low numbers in faeces, and consequently
  faecally contaminated water, and are susceptible to thermal and chlorine injury
  . They are tested for indirectly by determining if so-called "sentinel"
  bacteria, total coliforms, are present in the water. The purpose of coliform
  testing is two-fold; to monitor water treatment efficacy and to ensure that the
  "finished" or drinkable water does not get contaminated by breakthroughs in the
  distribution system on its way to the customer.

  by means of personal interviews and investigation at various workplaces. It
  should be noted that a case of sinunasal cancer was discovered in a farmer who
  used lead arsenate as an insecticidal. Furthermore the wife of a shipyard
  worker died of pleural mesothelioma. The death of a shipyard worker caused by
  pleural mesothelioma, provoked the critical review of the other workers of the
  same company who were also exposed to asbestos. Moreover, 73 deaths were
  recorded as due to silicosis; among them, 29 occurred in quartzite quarrymen.
  In addition, among 153 total cases of lung cancer, 9 were found to be
  associated with silicosis.

RN: 0
AB: With the spread of chloroquine resistant Plasmodium falciparum the control
  of malaria has become increasingly complex. In recent years, particular concern
  has arisen over how best to prevent malaria in non-immune international
  travellers. Prior to the recognition of the potential toxicity of some
  antimalarial drugs, malaria preventive guidelines switched from chloroquine to
  the newer compound antimalarial drugs and to amodiaquine; this adjustment was
  made when sentinel cases alerted clinicians that breakthrough infections
  occurred in travellers to East Africa taking chloroquine prophylaxis. Changes
  were also supported by data derived from field studies illustrating the
  effectiveness of these drugs for therapy in indigenous populations. However,
  international studies have now documented serious adverse reactions to
  pyrimethamine/dapsone, pyrimethamine/sulphadoxine, and amodiaquine, and caution
  is required with their use. Rates in British users concur with international
  estimates. Specialists preparing malaria preventive guidelines have, therefore,
  preferred to recommend the use of relatively safe antimalarial drugs, like
  chloroquine and proguanil, provided they offer non-immune travellers adequate
  protection against P. falciparum infections. Substantial difficulty has arisen,
  however, in the definition of 'adequate protection'. Field studies in
  indigenous communities with partial immunity can provide concise biological
  measures of parasite resistance to drugs. Unfortunately, these data cannot be
  used directly to determine the expected efficacy of chemoprophylactic drugs in
  non-immune populations. The transmission of malaria and the degree and
  intensity of resistance vary even within small geographical areas.
  Comprehensive patterns of resistance cannot be mapped out on a countrywide or
  regional basis for logistic reasons, and are restricted focally to discrete
  study locations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB: Although many states have laws that require health providers to report cases
  of occupational illness and injury, most states do not maintain a comprehensive
  system that actively identifies and targets potential sources of case reports
  and then responds to such reports. NIOSH has developed a Sentinel Event
  Notification System for Occupational Risks (SENSOR) that uses targeted sources
  of sentinel providers to recognize and report selected occupational disorders
  to a state surveillance center. SENSOR is a cooperative state-federal effort
  designed to develop local capability for preventing selected occupational
  disorders. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, NIOSH initially
  funded seven SENSOR projects in 1987 and three additional projects in early
  1988 (Table 1). Currently, these projects are in the preliminary stages of
  organization and start-up, with some having begun to receive case reports. As
  funds become available, NIOSH intends to gradually expand the scope of the
  program to include additional states over the next several years.

AB: Skin cancer of the scrotum is a disease that has been identified as a
  sentinel health event (occupational) (SHE(O] that is necessarily occupationally
  related. The present paper examines the feasibility of using this disease in
  active cancer surveillance in New York State. After consulting cancer case
  reports, hospital records, death certificates, and city directories, we
  obtained occupational data for 17 of 22 cases of nonmelanoma skin cancer of the
  scrotum diagnosed between 1979 and 1984. Only three cases had occupations
  previously linked to scrotal cancer, while 11 of 19 cases had one or more
  possibly contributory medical conditions. The probable under-reporting of
  scrotal cancer cases and incompleteness of occupational data may limit the
  usefulness of scrotal cancer as a sentinel health event (occupational) unless
  additional steps are taken.

  was monitored by testing for seroconversion to TMEV in sentinel mice in direct
  contact with index mice and in other sentinel mice in contact with bedding
  soiled by index mice. For the first 14 weeks after inoculation, two contact
  sentinels were housed with each index mouse for 1 week, then replaced with two
  new sentinels. For the remaining 16 weeks, contact sentinels were changed
  monthly. All index mice transmitted TMEV continuously (weekly) for 4 to 9
  weeks. Thereafter, six index mice transmitted virus intermittently. All index
  mice ceased transmitting TMEV 7 to 22 weeks post-inoculation. Results obtained
  from sentinel mice in contact with bedding soiled by index mice were 86%
  concordant with those using contact sentinel mice. Seven index mice were
  treated with cyclophosphamide or hydrocortisone 30 weeks post-inoculation. One
  cyclophosphamide treated mouse reinitiated virus shedding.

  component anomaly pairs of unidentified multiple congenital anomalies. It is an
  "opportunistic program," because the necessary data are available from the
  Hungarian Congenital Malformation Registry. This system is described and the
  criteria of a good registry are summarized. The analysis of indicator
  conditions caused by germinal mutations did not reveal any measurable mutagenic
  effects in Hungary following the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.
  The pros and cons of germinal mutation surveillance are discussed.

AB: Most oysters and mussels from U.S. coastal waters are contaminated with
  tributyltin (TBT) and its less toxic breakdown products (dibutyltin and
  monobutyltin). The concentrations of TBTs range from <5 to 1560 (366 av) ng of
  Sn/g dry weight as tin and account on average for 74% of the tin present as
  butyltins. Replicate oyster samples from a specific site concentrate TBT to the
  same level. Concentrations of TBT found in oysters varied both spacially and
  temporally. Both oysters and mussels concentrate TBT from their environment and
  are therefore excellent sentinel organisms to monitor the environmental levels
  of TBT available to marine organisms.

  in the U.S. Beaufort Sea and the framework for such a design were subjects of a
  joint MMS-NOAA workshop held in 1983. The proceedings of this workshop
  recommended implementation of the initial phase of the Beaufort Sea Monitoring
  Program (BSMP). The objectives of this study were to establish and implement a
  monitoring program to: 1) detect and quantify changes in trace metals and
  hydrocarbons in the Beaufort Sea sediments and sentinel organisms that might
  result from discharges of OCS oil and gas exploration and development
  activities; adversely affect or suggest adverse effects on man or his
  environment; and influence federal OCS regulatory management decisions, and 2)
  identify potential causes of any such changes. A set of null hypotheses was
  designed to aid in evaluation of the environmental impacts of Beaufort Sea OCS
  oil and gas-related development activities.

  repeated, precision sampling and chemical analyses of sentinel organisms whose
  aim is to quantify the current status of environmental quality of the USA
  coastal and estuarine regions and measure long-term spatial and temporal
  changes in concentrations of environmental contaminants. Data generated will be
  used to establish a high-quality, fully interpreted national database, thus
  providing a foundation for environmental management decisions and for testing
  scientific hypotheses on future marine pollution impacts. Mussels or oysters
  and depositional sediments have been collected at more than 100 Atlantic and
  Pacific coastal sites during the first three years of the program. Organic
  chemical measurements of PAH, PCB, and 16 pesticides and 17 trace and major
  metals have been completed on samples collected during year one and two.

  concentrations, an apparent steady state was reached within two weeks. At
  exposure concentrations of 63 ng/L and above, tissue burdens did not reach a
  steady state within six weeks and increased in proportion to exposure
  concentration. TBT concentrations in tissues were ranked as follows: gills much
  greater than viscera > adductor muscle approximately equals mantle, with gill
  concentrations consistently dominating those in other tissues throughout
  exposure. Bioconcentration factors for TBT in mussels were greater (range of
  1,500 to 7,300) than would be predicted from the K sub(ow) value. M. edulis

  solitary pupal parasitoid of house flies and stable flies, was monitored in two
  fly breeding habitats. Under a raised feedbunk, parasitism ranged from 32.5 to
  63.5% when monitored by a linear arrangement of sentinel house fly pupae.
  Dispersal pattern were not apparent; average parasitoid emergence from sentinel
  pupae on each side of the release point were not significantly different.
  Parasitoid releases in open-piled manure generally produced lower parasitism
  levels than under the feedbunk.

AB: The Hungarian Centre for Congenital Anomaly Control manages a number of
  surveillance programmes based on the Hungarian Congenital Malformation
  Registry. Notification of congenital anomalies, which is compulsory, originates
  exclusively from physicians working in various health institutions and is based
  on their diagnosis of malformed patients--newborns and infants. In recent
  years, the total birth prevalence of registered congenital anomalies has
  exceeded 47 per 1,000 total births. The notified data are critically evaluated
  and centrally coded according to the unit of notification, the affected
  individual. Diagnostic accuracy, completeness of notifications and the effect
  of confounding variables are continuously checked. The purpose of the Case
  -Control Surveillance System is to obtain etiological information concerning
  drug consumption, maternal diseases and occupational hazards during pregnancy.
  The surveillance of mutations through indicator conditions (sentinel anomalies.
  Down's syndrome and pairs of components of unidentified multiple congenital
  anomalies) is an attempt to measure the rate and trend of new germinal
  mutations. The nationwide follow-up of multimalformed infants helps to increase
  the proportion of identified congenital anomaly entities, to identify new ones,
  and to detect clusters caused by new environmental teratogenic or mutagenic
  factors.

AB: Mandates for provider reporting systems have existed in a number of states
  for many years, but due to various shortcomings the potential for targeted
  surveillance of occupational illness and injury has not been realized. To
  achieve a more uniform, active approach to provider reporting, SENSOR will be
  created as a cooperative state-federal effort designed to develop local
  capability for the recognition, reporting, follow-up, and prevention of
  selected occupational disorders. To demonstrate the feasibility of this
  approach, NIOSH funded a small number of SENSOR projects in 1987. Ultimately,
  joint state-federal support will be essential to maintain SENSOR activity
  within a state. SENSOR should not be viewed as the sole approach to the
  surveillance of occupational illness and injury. Other approaches to the
  identification of cases of occupational illness or injury and to monitoring the
  trends of occurrence of these disorders have been developed by NIOSH and
  various states, and they will continue to function.

AB: Three types of air-sampling apparatus (the Air-Sentinel, Burkard Personal
  Sampler and Casella Personal Sampler) were compared for their use in sampling
  the air in situations where individuals are exposed to laboratory animals, and
  a cascade impactor was used to determine the sizes of particles carrying the
  allergens under investigation. An ELISA, using monospecific antisera raised to
  selected major allergens of the mouse, rat and rabbit, i.e. mouse Ag 1 (mouse
  urinary prealbumin), rat Ag 4 (rat urinary prealbumin) and rabbit Ag R1, was
  developed to assay the extracts obtained from the samplers. This ELISA system
  was able to detect greater than 5 ng/m3 of allergen in sampled air. The rat and
  mouse allergens were shown to be carried mainly on particles of 6-18 micron,
  whereas the rabbit allergen was also found on particles of 2 micron and
  smaller. Allergen levels correlated well with the number of animals present in
  the room and the degree of activity during sampling. A protective filtered-air
  hood, when worn during surgical operation procedures, was shown to reduce
  effectively the level of rat allergen breathed by an individual.

RN: 0
AB: Although most teratogens are suspected to act early in the first trimester
  of pregnancy, birth defects monitoring programs and etiologic studies usually
  use residence at birth as a proxy measure for residence in the first trimester
  in searching for environmental teratogens. Because of the high mobility of the
  U.S. population, residence misclassification can potentially alter inferences
  concerning environmental teratogens. To evaluate this potential bias, data from
  the population-based Maryland Birth Defects Reporting and Information System
  were analyzed. In 1984, the system ascertained 295 infants with one or more of
  12 sentinel defects. Of these cases, 59 (20%) mothers reported they have
  changed address between the time of conception and the time of birth, and 22
  have moved to a different county. The residential mobility rate varied by
  demographic variables and was highest among white women, in the age group 20-24
  years. If residence at birth is used as a screening test for residence at
  conception, it can be shown that in the presence of an environmental
  teratogenic exposure, misclassification of exposure increases with increasing
  mobility rate, and population exposure frequency. Such misclassification tends
  to weaken associations between residence and birth defects and may lead to
  missing environmental teratogens. This analysis emphasizes the need to use
  residence information early in pregnancy rather than exclusively at birth.

  (ARD) always coincides with the peak of influenza virus activity. A survey of
  visits to a health maintenance organization between 1981 and 1983 allowed the
  authors to calculate the age-specific rates of visits for ARD during two
  moderately severe influenza epidemics (1981-1982 and 1982-1983). During the
  most intense period of influenza virus activity the rate of visits for ARD was
  about 12 per 100 persons; the risk of developing ARD was greatest for preschool
  children (1981-1982, 27 per 100; 1982-1983, 29 per 100) and averaged about 10
  for 100 for persons > 10 years of age. The risk of hospitalization with ARD was
  about 10 per 10,000 persons for residents of Harris County (Texas) during the
  same epidemics and was greatest for persons > 65 years of age.

  the field, especially in cattle but also in dogs or in wild fowl. In addition,
  the comparative and physiopathological aspects of this intoxication appear to
  be particularly interesting for both veterinarians and medicals. In the
  perspective of human health, animals can play an important role of sentinel or

AB: The recognition of Burkitt lymphoma (BL) as a clinical syndrome and a
  pathological entity in African children resulted from astute clinical
  observations (bedside epidemiology), the availability of cancer registry data
  and accurate pathological interpretation. Following the early studies in
  Africa, it soon became evident that this tumor occurred worldwide and the
  excess of cases in Africa was an incidence phenomenon associated with specific
  environmental factors. The sentinel discovery of the Epstein Barr virus (EBV)
  and its association with BL stimulated a wide variety of scientific
  investigations which have had an impact of virtually every discipline and
  biology. Epidemiological observations linked to modern laboratory techniques
  have provided etiological insights which implicate specific environmental
  factors and genetic events in the pathogenesis of BL and other
  immunoproliferative diseases. Early infection with EBV and holoendemic malaria
  are clearly of paramount importance in the development of endemic BL (eBL).
  These factors do not play a role in the majority of sporadic BL (sBL) cases,
  but immunosuppression and T-cell deregulation almost certainly are common
  denominators. The final or principle genetic event in both instances would
  appear to be the chromosome 8 translocation involving the c-myc oncogene and
  structural alteration. It is expected that the BL model will continue to be a
  useful one for identifying basic mechanisms in carcinogenesis which may be
  applicable as well to a variety of non-neoplastic diseases.

  classification and the use of sentinel physicians. Data were gathered on
  nonmalignant dermatologic and respiratory diagnoses prospectively at five sites
  and retrospectively at four of these sites. The combined approaches identified
  49 patients whose illnesses were probably work-related. Because the prospective
  approach took less than 10% of the time for each case identified compared with
  the time required for the retrospective approach, and prospective data are more
  timely and easier to access, the prospective approach appears to be better.

AB: This article describes a computer-based application of the Sentinel Health
  Event (Occupational) [SHE(O)] concept, developed in conjunction with five
  states, to monitor deaths which are occupationally related. The states have
  coded their state death certificate files for industry and occupation, using
  the decedent's usual occupation and industry as reported on the death
  certificate. From these files, the SHE(O) computer program selects deaths which
  are likely to be work-related, based on a previously published SHE(O) list of
  50 disease rubrics and associated industries and occupations. The computer
  program matches the SHE(O) list with the recorded industry, occupation, and
  underlying cause of death. The program has been tested using 1984 death
  certificate data from Maine, upstate New York (excluding New York City), North
  Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island. Approximately 1 to 2 per cent of all
  deaths were selected by the program, with lung cancer and coal workers'
  pneumoconiosis being the most frequent cause of death. The SHE(O) program may
  be useful for identifying deaths which are potentially occupationally related,
  but its utility and its application to death certificates needs further
  evaluation before recommending widespread use. Limitations are discussed, as
  well as plans for improving the application of the SHE(O) concept to death
  certificates.

  -6 weeks. Exposure was stopped and the fish were then transferred to clean,
  flowing seawater. Induced liver lesions were studied in periodic samples of
  fish taken during the next 140 weeks of holding. Lesions found following
  exposure were early altered basophilic and eosinophilic foci, oval cell
  hyperplasia, clear cell foci, neoplastic nodules, hepatocellular carcinomas,
  cholangiolar carcinomas, possible pericytomas originating in liver,
  hemangiopericytomas, spongiosis hepatis, and cholangiofibrosis. The relative
  prevalence of these lesions was given. Most of these lesions morphologically
  were compared to their counterpart lesions in the rat. Certain lesions in our
  fish such as hepatocellular carcinomas, cholangiolar carcinomas, pericytomas,
  hemangiopericytomas, spongiosis hepatis, and cholangiofibrosis have apparent
  similar cellular origins and morphogenesis to those lesions in rats and perhaps
  in other mammals. Spongiosis hepatis in the sheepshead minnow apparently arises
  from perisinusoidal cells and may be a neoplasm of this cell type. The general
  similarity of response to DENA in sheepshead minnows and rats suggests that
  this fish has promise as a model subject for studying some hepatocarcinogens
  and as a sentinel organism for detecting hepatocarcinogens in contaminated
  coastal waters.

AB: A disease consisting of suppurative endometritis, salpingitis,
  perioophoritis and/or peritonitis has been an important problem in aging B6C3F1
  mice on some chronic chemical carcinogenicity studies. Klebsiella oxytoca was
  identified as the most likely causative agent based on cultural isolations from
  lesions. A study was done to determine prevalence of K. oxytoca in the "normal"
  flora of mice from different breeding facilities. In a survey of 684 retired
  female breeder mice from 10 National Institutes of Environmental Health
  Sciences (NIEHS) and National Cancer Institute (NCI) production facilities, K.
  oxytoca was isolated from only 1% of nasopharynxes, vaginas and ceca in mice
  from 7 of 10 facilities. Epizootiology of the natural infection was
  investigated using the capsular and biochemical typing methods on 97 isolates
  of K. oxytoca from mice of 11 NIEHS and NCI production facilities and sentinel
  mice from three National Toxicology Program testing facilities. A few capsular
  types were associated with either lesions, nonlesion isolation sites, or
  certain facilities but the capsular typing method was not reproducible. No
  associations were found for any biotypes. A K. oxytoca isolate (capsular type
  20, biotype A) from a typical case of perioophoritis was used in attempts to
  reproduce the natural disease in Klebsiella-free B6C3F1 female mice. Mice were
  inoculated at 6 months of age by the intravaginal, intrauterine or
  intraperitoneal route with one of four doses of K. oxytoca and killed at 4, 7
  or 10 months post-infection. Some mice given high doses (10(6) or 10(8) colony
  forming units) of K. +oxytoca died of septicemia and a few developed mild
  inflammatory lesions in the uterus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB: The concentrations of Cd, Pb and Zn in 23 species of marine animal and three
  species of seagrass were determined from samples collected near a large lead
  smelter. The spatial patterns of metal distribution in sediments, seagrasses,
  crustaceans and fish could be described in terms of distance from the smelter,
  although the fit of the mathematical model was often improved by the inclusion
  of other environmental variables, such as clay content of the sediment or time
  of sample collection. In the fish and seagrasses, Zn was the most widely
  dispersed metal, followed by Cd, then Pb, which was least dispersed. In
  general, organisms at higher trophic levels (fish) had lower metal
  concentrations than primary producers (seagrass). There was evidence for
  bioaccumulation of metals in many species, especially in the molluscs, but no
  biomagnification of any metal could be detected.

  were detected in tree hole waters that ranged in pH from 6.5 to 9.3 and
  electrical conductivities between 0.10 and 5.11 mmhos/cm. Third and fourth
  instar larvae were most frequently infected, and most immatures that succumbed
  to infections died while in the fourth instar. Most hosts contained only one
  nematode. Infected adults were obtained from emergence traps over tree holes,
  from field-collected immatures reared in the laboratory, and from mosquito
  collections from sentinel humans. Octomyomermis troglodytis escaped from adults
  into water vials in the laboratory, suggesting that infected adult mosquitoes
  serve as dispersal agents for this parasite.

AB: Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) has been designated by the US Environmental
  Protection Agency as a chemical of interest. Re-examination of previously
  analysed gas chromatograms and archived samples revealed peaks that co-eluted
  with the authentic HCB standard. Levels of HCB were less than 1 ng/g in all
  samples re-examined, and were at least three to four orders of magnitude lower
  than those of poly-chlorinated biphenyls, two orders of magnitude lower than
  those of pyrene and one to two orders of magnitude lower than levels of either
  phenanthrene or benzo[a]-pyrene found in the same mussel samples. Chromatograms
  of sea water (dissolved and particulate phases) and sediments also revealed
  very low levels of HCB. Because gas chromatography-mass spectrometry results
  indicated that levels of HCB were below the level of detection it was not
  possible to verify its presence. The environmental data on HCB provided by the
  US Mussel Watch programme demonstrate that HCB levels in mussels are minor
  compared with other organic compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls and
  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (phenanthrene, pyrene and benzo[a]pyrene).
  Mussels were transplanted to areas affected by industrial activity and by
  disposal of sewage sludge and dredged materials, and in relatively clean
  reference sites. Transplanted mussels were used to monitor the marine food
  chain, as surrogates for other biota in the same areas and as sentinel
  organisms to monitor localized differences in biologically available chemical
  compounds. The degree of environmental threat posed by HCB in the marine
  environment, as indicated by the US Mussel Watch data, is relatively low. It is
  therefore recommended that a decision be made not to pursue an expanded HCB
  monitoring programme in the marine environment solely to collect more HCB data.

  administered prophylactically to pigs at concentrations of 5 to 100 mg/kg of
  feed and tylosin at 110 mg/kg of feed for 28 or 31 days prevented swine
  dysentery induced by tylosin-sensitive T hyodysenteriae strain SQ2; 15
  nonmedicated, inoculated control pigs had bloody diarrhea, and 9 pigs died. In
  2 additional trials, AIV administered prophylactically for 28 days at 55 or 110
  mg/kg of feed prevented swine dysentery induced by tylosin-insensitive T
  hyodysenteriae strain B204. All of the inoculated principal pigs medicated with
  AIV at 55 or 110 mg/kg of feed or carbadox at 55 mg/kg of feed and the
  noninoculated sentinel pigs for each group had solid feces throughout the 56
  -day trial. In the nonmedicated, inoculated control groups, bloody diarrhea
  began at 4 to 5 days after inoculation was done, and 9 of 10 principal pigs and
  6 of 9 sentinel pigs had dysentery; 2 pigs died. In the groups medicated with
  AIV at 27.5 or 5.5 mg/kg of feed, all 5 principal pigs and 3 or 4 sentinel pigs
  in each group had dysentery; 3 or 4 pigs in each group died. In the group
  medicated with tylosin at 110 mg/kg of feed, 7 of 10 principal pigs and all 9

AB: Malignant mesothelioma is a sentinel neoplasm for population exposure to
  asbestiform fibers. Public health officials may be alerted to temporal or
  spatial clustering of malignant mesothelioma through analyses of vital records,
  such as death certificates. Hence, the maintenance of the integrity of the
  vital statistics system, particularly the cause of death statement on the death
  certificate, is very important. The report by a northeastern Minnesota
  radiologist in January 1985 of an elevated prevalence of pleural plaques
  (related to asbestiform fiber exposure) to the Minnesota Department of Health
  resulted in an investigation of pleural malignant mesothelioma mortality trends
  in that area and in three other similar areas in the State. In that study, we
  noted that in several instances malignant mesothelioma (either intrathoracic or
  unspecified site) was listed on the death certificate in such a manner as to
  imply that the neoplasm was either a lung cancer or a malignancy of an
  unspecified site. The effect of this misclassification is to underestimate the
  mortality from malignant mesothelioma by fourfold to eightfold. Given the
  importance of malignant mesothelioma as a proxy for past asbestos exposure, it
  is necessary to determine the extent of such misclassification for all deaths
  in the United States.

AB: The impact of an environmental change on an organism is realized as
  alterations to various physiological, cellular or biochemical steady-states. If
  the organism in its altered condition is significantly less fitted for
  survival, growth and reproduction, then it is said to be under stress. The
  stress response is defined as a mesurable alteration of a functional steady
  -state which is induced by an environmental change and which renders the
  individual (or the population) more vulnerable to further environmental change.
  The biological effects of pollutant-induced stress may therefore be measured as
  altered steady-states at different levels of functional complexity. This
  presentation considers biological stress responses at the molecular,
  subcellular and cellular levels of organisation, with particular emphasis on
  the use of marine mussels and other molluscs as sentinel organisms for
  assessing pollutant effects.

AB: Epidemiology has historically played an important role in the recognition of
  causes for diseases affecting the health of the public. The responsibility for
  interpreting the potential severity of the health effects of these
  environmental contaminants has fallen to those scientists experienced in
  epidemiology. This has led to a subdiscipline, reactive epidemiology, which
  describes investigations focused on specific events, usually under emotion
  -laden circumstances, rather than scientific merit. The reactive epidemiologist
  is rigidly constrained as to the size, timing, and location of the study. There

  similar each year, occurring in late July or early August. Influenza in turkeys

  not only a natural reservoir of influenza but also have a seasonal infection
  that appears to be related to seasonal influenza outbreaks in domestic turkeys
  in Minnesota. However, only some influenza A virus isolates circulating among
  waterfowl at any given time appear capable of causing detectable infection in
  turkeys. It is speculated that the seasonal infection in migratory waterfowl
  may also be related to seasonal influenza infections in other species including

AB: Epidemiology has historically played an important role in the recognition of
  causes for diseases affecting the health of the public. Initially, epidemiology
  was concerned with infectious diseases. Later it became involved in metabolic
  and dietary deficiency diseases. Most recently, epidemiology has addressed the
  question of the public health effects of chemicals from production facilities,
  accidental spills, and chemical waste disposal sites. Concurrent improvements
  in the sensitivity of chemical analyses have enabled the identification of
  chemicals arising from waste disposal sites in the soil, air, drinking water,
  and food supplies of neighboring residential areas, albeit usually at very low
  concentrations. This knowledge has created great concerns among the affected
  populations and their public health agencies. The responsibility for
  interpreting the potential severity of the health effects of these
  environmental contaminants has fallen to those scientists experienced in
  epidemiology. This has led to a subdiscipline, reactive epidemiology, which
  describes investigations focused on specific events, usually under emotion
  -laden circumstances, rather than scientific merit. The reactive epidemiologist
  is rigidly constrained as to the size, timing, and location of the study. There
  is a strong requirement for public communication skills. New data bases are
  needed including "sentinel" diseases that are linked to exposure to chemicals,
  records of land use, and residency data for the population at risk.

AB: The possibility of monitoring siliceous sponges as an ideal bioindicator of
  17 trace metals and halogens was investigated. Of the two species of Demosponge
  from the Indian coastal waters receiving stable and radioactive nuclides (54Mn,
  63Ni, 65Zn, 60Co, 75Se, 113Sn, 90Sr, 131I, 137Cs), Spirastrella cuspidifera was
  found to accumulate Cd, Cr, and Sn in the range of 15-2000 micrograms g-1 dry
  tissue, some 5-7 orders of magnitude higher than in the ambient waters.
  Prostylyssa foetida, from the same microecological niche, was found to be
  totally free of these three metal ions. The bioaccumulation of Ni was also
  significantly higher in S. cuspidifera (400-2250 micrograms g-1) than in P.
  foetida (7-15 micrograms g-1). The former species was also found to be an ideal
  sentinel for detecting levels of Co, Zn, and Ti; levels of Cu, Mn, Pb Fe and Sr
  were higher in P. foetida, but those of the halogens I and Br were practically
  identical in both species. Furthermore, bioaccumulation of metal ions was found
  to be a function of sponge tissue itself, rather than that of either obligate
  or facultative symbiont microflora. In view of the high degree of species
  specificity which sponges exhibit while accumulating many trace metal ions, a
  'sponge watch programme' is proposed on a global scale for monitoring the
  health of coastal ecosystems against a variety of potentially toxic pollutants.

AB: To determine the relative occurrence of hepatitis A, B, and non-A/non-B in
  the United States, serum samples and epidemiologic data were collected from
  patients with hepatitis in five selected counties. Overall, 41, 33, and 26
  percent of the patients had hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis non-A/non
  -B, respectively. The incidence, especially of hepatitis A, varied
  considerably. All three types of hepatitis occurred more frequently in those 15
  to 44 years of age. Hepatitis A predominated in those less than 15 years of age
  and non-A/non-B predominated in those older than 44 years. There was a male
  predominance (65 to 62 percent) for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, but non-A/non
  -B occurred equally in both sexes. There was no seasonal pattern for any type.
  Risk factors for hepatitis A were previous contact with a patient with
  hepatitis (26 percent), homosexual (male) preference (15 percent), and day-care
  center contact (11 percent). For hepatitis B, risk factors included drug use
  (26 percent), previous contact with an infected person (22 percent), homosexual
  preference (12 percent), and a health-care occupation (12 percent). For
  hepatitis non-A/non-B, risk factors included drug use (16 percent), transfusion
  (12 percent), and previous contact with an infected person (12 percent).
  Previous hospitalization appeared to be a risk factor for both hepatitis B and
  hepatitis non-A/non-B.

  projects were undertaken to test the feasibility of using the Common Crow as a
  reliable sentinel species of sylvatic rabies. In one project, captive crows
  contracted rabies orally when fed rabies infected mine brains. One-year-old
  crows developed an earlier humoral immune response with a greater mean antibody
  titer than did 2-year-old birds. Antibody levels persisted for about 2 weeks.
  No birds died or showed overt clinical signs of rabies disease during the
  experiment. In another project, rabies virus remained viable in striped skunk
  carcasses for about 2 weeks at 24 degree C and throughout the 22-day study
  period at 10 degree C. The skunks with experimentally induced furious rabies
  had a higher mean titer than did the other skunks. In order to determine the
  geographic area that a crow survey of rabies would monitor, information was
  collected on crow foraging areas and movement patterns.

  position, therapy room and machine constraints (field size, distance) and beam
  modifiers (bolus, compensators, shields). Related variable include chemotherapy
  agents and schedules, and 'boost' radiotherapy. Seven representative
  insitutions that treat a large number of TBI patients were surveyed for these
  variables. Homogeneity has been achieved generally within +/- 10% with the use
  of these techniques. One 'sentinel' effect is disucssed, namely interstitial
  pneumonitis, as a measure of normal tissue effects with varying techniques.
  There is an indication that more fractionated methods, used either daily or in
  a hyperfractionated fashion, are leading to a decreased incidence of

AB: A sentinel phenotype is a clinical disorder or syndrome that (1) occurs
  sporadically as a consequence of a single, highly penetrant mutant gene, (2) is
  a dominant or X-linked trait of considerable frequency and low fitness, and (3)
  is uniformly expressed and accurately diagnosable with minimal effort at or
  near birth. Although 1828 autosomal dominant traits are known in human beings,
  36 can be considered as candidate sentinel phenotypes, along with 5 X-linked
  disorders. Based on surveys of malformations in infants and children, 16
  additional traits are proposed beyond previous lists. In Hungary, the 24
  syndromes or defects with reliable manifestations in newborn infants occur with
  a frequency of 2.5-3.3 per 10 000 live births. As markers of human mutations,
  sentinel phenotypes have the advantage of representing germinal mutations that
  result in significant health problems. There are severe disadvantages that
  have, to date, prevented the launching of a field demonstration of the value of
  these phenotypes in mutation epidemiology. Agreement on a list of phenotypes
  has been delayed by continued recognition of two or more distinct genetic
  diseases within what was once thought to be a single disorder. For the same
  reason, most of the candidate sentinel phenotypes have not been assigned unique
  codes in the International Classification of Diseases. Each of the disorders is
  so rare and has features that overlap with so many other syndromes that highly
  trained clinical dysmorphologist and pediatric ophthalmologists would have to
  be engaged in any study. The sentinel phenotype approach, like other strategies
  in mutation epidemiology, would encounter problems with linkage among files of
  data, privacy, and access to sufficiently large populations. In contrast with
  the approach using multiple protein variants (as in the study of blood from
  offspring of survivors of the atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki), the
  sentinel phenotype approach would likely be much less expensive and would
  encounter far fewer false attributions of paternity, but also would require a
  much larger study population. The best option for the present, in our opinion,
  is to broaden and sustain critical discussion of the approach. Perhaps the goal
  should be to plan a field demonstration by involving appropriate clinicians,
  epidemiologists, and public health officials. A pilot effort underway in
  Hungary may well give insight to applying the approach in a significantly
  larger population.

  (Occupational) is a disease, disability, or untimely death which is
  occupationally related and whose occurrence may: 1) provide the impetus for
  epidemiologic or industrial hygiene studies; or 2) serve as a warning signal
  that materials substitution, engineering control, personal protection, or
  medical care may be required. The present SHE(O) list encompasses 50 disease
  conditions that are linked to the workplace. Only those conditions are included
  for which objective documentation of an associated agent, industry, and
  occupation exists in the scientific literature. The list will serve as a
  framework for developing a national system for occupational health surveillance
  that may be applied at the state and local level, and as a guide for practicing
  physicians caring for patients with occupational illnesses. We expect to update
  the list periodically to accommodate new occupational disease events which meet
  the criteria for inclusion.

  Prairie Provinces and British Columbia. A fourth mosquito-borne arbovirus,
  eastern equine encephalomyelitis, has caused cases of encephalitis among
  horses, but not humans, in Quebec. Surveillance systems for detecting their
  prevalence include (i) reports of current viral activity activity in the USA;
  (ii) vertebrate serology ($0.85 per sample); (iii) sentinel animals; (iv)
  vector population levels and isolation of virus in vectors ($10.00 per mosquito

  all ages of genetic diseases in human populations is a prerequisite for
  assessing the magnitude of possible genetic hazards caused by environmental
  mutagens. However, both theoretical and practical difficulties are involved in
  precisely measuring the total frequency of these diseases. Two sets of data
  from large-scale population studies, one from Northern Ireland and the other
  from British Columbia, are compared with each other and with the results from
  ad hoc surveys for individual monogenic disorders. With due allowance for
  differences in approach, examination indicates that the data from the large
  -scale population studies are inadequate. However, it could provide a crude
  estimate of the total frequency of genetic diseases and a fairly reliable
  estimate of the individual frequency of certain genetic disorders with early
  onset that are familiar and readily diagnosed. In addition to environmental
  mutagens, there are a number of factors associated with current human activity
  that may change the incidence of genetic diseases. In order to monitor the
  human population for environmental mutagens, the change in frequency of
  sporadic cases of those genetic diseases that arose from fresh mutation and
  that can be easily detected as early as possible should be followed closely.
  The mechanism of data collection currently being employed in some countries for
  childhood cancers, certain congenital malformations, and inborn errors of
  metabolism could be extended to include the so-called sentinel phenotypes. The
  rationale and feasibility of using retinoblastoma and Wilms' tumor
  (nephroblastoma) as examples of such population monitoring are described.

AB: Chromatid gaps occur as two morphologically indistinguishable types--the
  clastogenic (DNA damage) type and the turbagenic (no DNA damage) type--and are
  induced by many genotoxins in a dose-dependent way. Gaps may serve as a low
  -dose sentinel parameter in genotoxicology. However, their usefulness is
  limited until further studies have shown whether the turbagenic substances that
  cause gaps are all capable of inducing segregational errors. In genetic
  toxicology testing and monitoring, methanol/acetic acid-fixed and air-dried
  preparations are stained in Giemsa and are then studied under the light
  microscope. With this method gaps and breaks cannot be distinguished
  unambiguously and should therefore be scored in the same class of aberrations.

AB: A competitive inhibition enzyme immunoassay (EIA) was developed to detect
  and quantify levels of the organophosphate insecticide paraoxon in body fluids.
  Protein-conjugated paraoxon served as an immunogen for the production of rabbit
  heteroantiserum, from which affinity purified IgG anti-paraoxon antibodies were
  isolated using a heterologous protein-paraoxon-conjugated immunoabsorbent. In
  the competitive inhibition EIA a standard curve was generated for the
  inhibition of binding of anti-paraoxon IgG to a solid-phase bound heterologous
  protein-paraoxon conjugate by various concentrations of free paraoxon. Binding
  was proportionate to the color change of an appropriate substrate generated by
  an enzyme-conjugated second antibody specific for the rabbit IgG anti-paraoxon.
  The assay detected paraoxon levels as low as 10(-10)M (28 pg/ml) in buffer, and
  serum paraoxon levels as low as 10(-9)M. In addition to its sensitivity, this
  technique is ideally suited to the simultaneous processing of large numbers of
  samples in less than 2 hr. The competitive inhibition EIA is cost effective and
  should facilitate environmental surveillance using sentinel animals, expand
  laboratory toxicology studies, and improve clinical detection capabilities.

  leaves grown in clean air were uniformly turgid with fluffy epicuticular wax.
  Leaf samples from ramets that were grown in polluted air exhibited collapsed

  censused and intensively studied for 50 hr the capped langur, P. pileatus , in
  the Madhupur Forest, Bangladesh. Transects were made in the forest to provide
  tree girth and height measurements. The predominant tree species is sal, Shorea
  robusta . The mean group size for capped langur troops observed in excess of 1
  hr was 8.7, and that for troops censused for less than 1 hr, 7.5. Troops were
  primarily unimale, but one all-male band of four and a solitary adult male were
  sighted. The adult sex ratio of females to males was 2:1. The equivalent
  ecological density for intensively studied troops was 92 individuals/km
  super(2). Estimated ecological biomass was equal to 716.5 kg/km super(2). A
  daily activity profile shows that the capped langur has a bimodal feeding
  schedule. Midday is clearly a rest period. Adult males spend much time in
  sentinel behavior and an unusual penile display is described. Instances of
  intergroup antagonism are detailed. Fighting was observed on one occasion.

AB: The mechanisms by which administration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
  (PAH) stimulates drug-metabolizing enzymes are summarized. The hepatic
  monooxygenase system of marine and freshwater fish is also induced by PAH-type
  compounds, including chlorinated dioxins and certain polychlorinated and
  polybrominated biphenyl isomers, and these chemicals are, or are suspected to
  be, toxic to humans. Consequently, there is considerable interest in whether or
  not PAH-type induction in fish can be used as a sentinel or early warning
  indicator for certain classes of toxic pollutants in the aquatic environment.
  We have investigated various aspects of PAH-type induction in marine fish and
  have found that approximately 50% of the winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes
  americanus), captured near Mount Desert Island, Maine, appear to have induced
  hepatic monooxygenase systems, which suggests that they are exposed to PAH-type
  chemicals in the environment. The potential advantages and limitations of using
  PAH-type enzyme induction as a sentinel system for pollutants in aquatic
  ecosystems are discussed.

  dogs, 7 (9%) of 80 cats, 9 (32%) of 28 cattle and 31 (26%) of 121 horses had
  antibodies against C. burnetii. Of 316 stray dogs 208 (66%) were seropositive.
  The overall prevalence of 53% among 1040 dogs tested was comparable to the 63%
  antibody prevalence found in an earlier survey among coyotes and foxes in
  wildlife areas of California. When the dog was considered as a sentinel animal
  for the presence of C. burnetii surrounding household environments, it was
  hypothesized that the common, low level exposures in the community are similar
  to those found in more remote wildlife areas.

AB: In August and September 1977 a discrete cluster of 27 serologically or
  pathologically confirmed cases of Legionnaires' disease, plus six highly
  presumptive cases were identified in the area of Kingsport, Tennessee. Three
  patients died. Most patients manifested severe pneumonia and fever; no mild or
  asymptomatic disease forms were recognized despite intensive case-finding
  efforts. Illness was epidemiologically associated with residing, visiting, or
  working in one geographic area of Kingsport, residence there being the factor
  most strongly associated. Although the attack rate for area residents was
  0.64%, the randomly determined prevalence of serologic reactors was 5.2%, which
  is not significantly different from that in a nonimplicated control
  neighborhood. The epidemic did not correlate temporally with any identified
  environmental or demographic event. No source of the bacterium was found either
  by a detailed case-control study of area associations or by bacterial isolation
  from sentinel guinea pigs or environmental specimens. There was no evidence of
  person-to-person spread.

  surface water. An experiment has been performed in Champagne with the aim of
  pursuing a collective area for pesticide waste water collection and studying
  two treatment devices. The two tested systems, Sentinel and Epu-Mobil, ensured
  some good treatment performances. However, the design of the collective area
  needs to be optimised. Control of water consumption and a separation of waste
  waters are required. Furthermore, as in any environmental approach, pollution
  reduction has to be considered upstream, by making wine-growers aware of the
  problem and adjusting pesticide application equipment in order to avoid excess
  waste.

AB: Despite various conservation approaches by the Department of Fisheries and
  Oceans in Newfoundland over the last 25 years, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar)
  are generally showing slow signs of recovery. One major concern has been the by
  -catch of salmon in cod (Gadus morhua) traps. Prior to the 1996 fishing season,
  selected fishers in three communities were selected to operate an experimental
  trap in conjunction with the sentinel trap fishers. Three methods to exclude
  salmon from the traps were evaluated: 1) deflectors, hung 3 meters deep,
  containing 7" mesh, 2) large (16") mesh in the top 3 meters of leader, 3)
  sinking the leader 3 meters below the surface. All three exclusion methods
  tested showed positive results towards the reduction of salmon by-catch in cod
  traps.

AB: The 1996 Atlantic Groundfish Management Plan will be guided by the need to
  conserve stocks, which is the first priority. All groundfish moratoria now in
  place will be maintained. The Fisheries Resource Conservation Council (FRCC)
  recommended expanded sentinel fisheries for three northern cod (Gadus morhua)
  stocks to satisfy a need for information on the state of the stocks in the
  absence of commercial fisheries data. Moratoria and reduced TACs on traditional
  groundfish species have, in some areas, resulted in a redirection of effort to
  species and stocks that have not been heavily fished in the past. Quota
  management and other control measures will be used to control fishing effort on
  these stocks in 1996.

AB: A moratorium on commercial fishing on this northern cod (Gadus morhua) stock
  has been in effect since 1992. Although catches from a recreational fishery
  were relatively high in the year following the moratorium, catches over the
  last two years are thought to be minimal. The Sentinel Survey resulted in a
  catch of about 330 t in 1995. This catch was submitted to intensive biological
  sampling. Autumn research vessel survey indices of cod biomass and abundance in
  divisions 2J3KL have indicated severe declines. There is some indication from
  mean weights at age in both the Sentinel Survey catches and the trawl survey
  that the downward trend has been reversed. Of particular concern in the
  assessment of this stock is the absence of any indication of good recruitment.

AB: Oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau) are a resident part of the estuarine benthic
  food web from the New England States to Florida in the U.S.A. They are a
  sentinel species with the potential to extract toxic environmental trace
  metals. To test this hypothesis, we are studying toadfish resident in the
  Chesapeake Bay near Annapolis, Maryland, U.S.A. This area is away from any
  direct industrial or commercial effluents carrying trace metals but has
  concentrations of trace metals in the benthic sediments. Since the toadfish is
  a resident, non-migratory benthic predator, we feel it is useful in studying
  trace metal contamination and eventually modeling metal movements in a
  biological system. This study concentrates on trace metals found in the
  physiologically important organ, the liver.

AB: The aim of this study was to apply a parameter identification method
  developed by Lions (e.g. Lions[5]), the Sentinel Method, to groundwater
  pollution. The mathematical basis of this method was to solve parameter
  identification problems where many data are unknown, in particular initial and
  boundary conditions. First the inverse problem was solved in the linear case to
  estimate pollutant mass. Two different algorithms can be used: the direct or
  the iterative one. The direct method was compared with the more classical Least
  Squares method. Then the non-linear case was studied to recover the source
  coordinates and/or the dispersivity. Numerical tests were conducted on the
  Rhenan aquifer south of Strasbourg, which velocity field has been estimated by
  a previous study. The Sentinel method recovered mass flow with respect to the
  time and pollutant source location. Results show how estimation reliability
  depends on available observations. More generally, these tests can help
  choosing relevant observation points location and pointing out the advantages
  and limitations of the Sentinel method for solving groundwater pollution
  problems.

AB: Patterns in the occurrence of influenza-like symptoms after increases in
  ambient sulphur dioxide (SO2) concentrations, have been investigated. Three
  routinely collected sets of data were used: (a) air pollution, including SO2,
  as measured continuously by the National Air Monitoring System; (b) ambient
  outdoor air temperature as measured hourly by the Royal Dutch Meteorological
  Institute and (c) weekly influenza incidence as monitored by the Dutch Sentinel
  Practice Network. The region investigated has been confined to the three
  western provinces of the Netherlands. The data were expressed as weekly average
  values. To correct for autocorrelation the 'Box-Jenkins approach' to model time
  series was used. After correction for seasonal patterns and a log
  transformation the ARMA (autoregressive and moving average) models were
  identified. The relation between the time series has been assessed by a
  transfer function model. After correction for temperature and with a delay of
  two weeks, a significant association could be ascertained between the hourly
  SO2 concentration and influenza incidence. An association between lower
  temperature and increased influenza incidence one week later was established as
  well. A relation of air pollution and influenza with a delay of about two weeks
  is quite possible. However, 12 years may have been too short a period to
  correct for secular patterns and SO2 was probably only an indicator of air
  pollution. Further investigation seems warranted.
