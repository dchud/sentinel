TI  - ERGDB: Estrogen Responsive Genes Database.
PG  - D533-6
AB  - ERGDB is an integrated knowledge database dedicated to genes responsive to
      estrogen. Genes included in ERGDB are those whose expression levels are
      experimentally proven to be either up-regulated or down-regulated by
      estrogen. Genes included are identified based on publications from the
      PubMed database and each record has been manually examined, evaluated and
      selected for inclusion by biologists. ERGDB aims to be a unified gateway
      to store, search, retrieve and update information about estrogen
      responsive genes. Each record contains links to relevant databases, such
      as GenBank, LocusLink, Refseq, PubMed and ATCC. The unique feature of
      ERGDB is that it contains information on the dependence of gene reactions
      on experimental conditions. In addition to basic information about the
      genes, information for each record includes gene functional description,
      experimental methods used, tissue or cell type, gene reaction, estrogen
      exposure time and the summary of putative estrogen response elements if
      the gene's promoter sequence was available. Through a web interface at
      http://sdmc.i2r.a-star.edu.sg/ergdb/ cgi-bin/explore.pl users can either
      browse or query ERGDB. Access is free for academic and non-profit users.

TI  - Contemporary issues in mild traumatic brain injury.
PG  - 1885-94
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine (1) minimum criteria in adults for clinical
      diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) and (2) whether persistent
      postconcussive syndrome exists as a nosologic entity. DATA SOURCES: PubMed
      search by MEDLINE of head injuries from January 1977 to July 2002. STUDY
      SELECTION: All reviews and studies of mild TBI with special reference to
      those on persistent postconcussive syndrome having a general trauma cohort
      as a control comparison. DATA EXTRACTION: Review of design and other
      methodologic issues. Studies dependent on superior strength of evidence
      (as defined by the American Academy of Neurology) concerning the biologic
      nature of persistent postconcussive syndrome. DATA SYNTHESIS: A period of
      altered awareness with amnesia brought on by a direct craniofacial blow is
      the starting point in determining whether diffuse mild TBI has occurred.
      An amnestic scale is more helpful than Glasgow Coma Scale score in grading
      mild injury and in formulating minimum inclusion criteria for mild TBI.
      Neuropsychologic test results coupled with self-reported symptoms should
      not be taken as the primary source of evidence for mild TBI. Prolonged
      cognitive impairment after injury is not unique to brain trauma.
      CONCLUSIONS: Persistent postconcussive syndrome after mild brain trauma,
      uncomplicated by focal injury, is biologically inseparable from other
      examples of the posttraumatic syndrome. To account for the persistent
      cognitive and behavioral sequelae of posttraumatic states, including
      persistent postconcussive syndrome, we need further studies on the
      emerging concept of limbic neuronal attrition occurring as a maladaptive
      response to pain and stress.

TI  - Exploiting research information: comments about the different databases in
      health care (DIMDI, OVID CD-ROM).
PG  - 155-9
AB  - The rapid growth of medical knowledge creates a demand for new ways of
      providing information. Health professionals are dealing with a variety of
      cases, and as they have no time to visit the library, they need filtered
      information instantly. Medical knowledge databases and data sets are
      increasingly available in electronic form, particularly on the World Wide
      Web. The premise of this medium is that it offers a "world of knowledge at
      your fingertips". The reality, however, is somewhat different, as
      information systems are not well integrated into clinical practice, they
      prove difficult to find specific information in, and contain content of
      varying quality. The continued evaluation of the medium in the future,
      should be beneficial as evidence-based resources available, and these
      resources are integrated into electronic medical record systems. The DIMDI
      and OVID CD-ROM databases are presented as vehicles of research in
      Bio-Medical Sciences.

TI  - Impact of emerging technologies on medication errors and adverse drug
      events.
PG  - 1447-58
AB  - Published evidence on the effects of computerized physician order entry
      (CPOE), automated dispensing machines (ADMs), bar coding, and computerized
      medication administration records (CMARs) on medication errors and adverse
      drug events (ADEs) were reviewed. Emerging technologies have been
      recommended as potential mechanisms for reducing medication errors.
      Critical evaluations of the impact of these new technologies on medication
      errors and other adverse outcomes are lacking. PubMed was searched to
      identify all peer-reviewed publications linking four technologies (CPOE,
      ADMs, bar coding, and CMARs) with reductions in medication errors and ADEs
      and secondary endpoints. All controlled studies that assessed the impact
      of the technologies were evaluated. The appropriateness of the use of
      these technologies was also examined. Few studies were identified that
      evaluated the technologies' impact on these endpoints. Of the evaluated
      technologies, CPOE was the most studied; however, investigations were
      limited to selected medical centers. The appropriateness of use of the
      technologies was evaluated even more infrequently. A literature review
      revealed a paucity of controlled, generalizable studies confirming the
      benefits of technologies intended to reduce medication errors and ADEs.
      Very little evidence on the appropriateness of the use of these
      technologies was found.
