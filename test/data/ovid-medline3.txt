AB  - OBJECTIVE: Many studies have been conducted in order to
      evaluate the genotoxicity of chemicals and waste materials, which
      utilized in vivo test protocols. The use of animals for routine
      toxicity testing is now questioned by a growing segment of society.
      METHODS: Keeping the above fact in mind, we have conducted in the
      present study the genotoxicity evaluation of oily sludge samples
      generated from a petroleum refinery and petrochemical industry and
      ETP sludge from petroleum refinery using DNA damage, chromosomal
      aberration, p53 protein induction and apoptosis in short term in
      vitro mammalian Chinese Hamster Ovary cell cultures. RESULTS: It is
      evident from the results that the oily sludge compounds derived from
      petroleum refinery and petrochemical industry could cause DNA
      damage, chromosomal aberration, p53 protein accumulation and
      apoptotic cell death on exposure to oily sludge extracts in the
      presence of metabolic activation system (S-9 mix), however, ETP
      sludge extract could not cause significant genotoxicity in
      comparison to oily sludge extract and negative control. CONCLUSION:
      The effect may be attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
      present in the samples as evidenced from GC-MS.

AB  - Vitellogenin (VTG), a phospholipoglycoprotein precursor of egg
      yolk is synthesized and secreted in the liver in response to
      circulating estrogens in female fish. Thus, the presence of VTG in
      male fish is a useful biomarker to identify estrogenic activity of
      natural or anthropogenic substances in sewage effluents. We report
      the purification of carp (Cyprinus carpio) and perch (Perca
      fluviatilis) VTG with the subsequent development and
      characterization of a specific ELISA for VTG measurement. VTG was
      purified by combination of ion exchange chromatography and size
      exclusion chromatography. The purified proteins were used as antigen
      for antibody production, as standard and tracer in the assay. Carp
      VTG was stable and showed a characteristic double band after Western
      blotting of the purified protein and in serum samples, respectively.
      In perch samples, several bands with lower molecular weight were
      present and appeared to be degradation products of VTG. The
      development of the carp VTG ELISA led to a sensitive and valid test
      system with inter-assay coefficients of variation between 3.0 and
      12.3%. In contrast to carp, the described ELISA for perch VTG showed
      a much higher inter-assay variation up to 24%, possibly attributable
      to fast protein degradation. In conclusion, the described two-step
      chromatography is a simple purification method for VTG.
      Immunological and electrophoretical test systems are valid methods
      to determine VTG in some species like carp, but for other species
      like perch in which VTG is not stable, these methods are not
      applicable.

AB  - In this study, the impact of an exposure of zebrafish embryos
      (Danio rerio) until 3 months post fertilization to
      17alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2: 0; 0,1; 1; 10; 25 ng/l) was evaluated
      for growth and development, gonad development and body vitellogenin
      (VTG) content. After a recovery period of 5 months, the female
      reproductive success was evaluated. The results demonstrated a
      significant reduction in total body length, body weight, whole body
      Ca and P content and an increase in morphological abnormalities for
      fish exposed to 25 ng/l EE2 as a function of exposure time. An
      increase in total body VTG content was observed for fish exposed for
      a period of 3 months down to levels of 1 ng/l EE2. At the age of 3
      months, a dose-dependent increase of the number of fish with no
      macroscopic recognizable gonads was observed (up to 100% at 25 ng/l
      EE2). After a recovery period on clean tap water for 5 months, all
      fish had developed either ovaries or testis with a gonadosomatic
      index not different from control fish and the sex ratio was similar
      in EE2 treatment groups and controls. Nevertheless, a reduced number
      of spawning females and a reduced egg production were found for the
      female fish exposed to 10 or 25 ng/l EE2 for 3 months and which were
      allowed to recover for 5 months. Although the underlying mechanism
      could not be elucidated, these findings did indicate that the
      reproduction potential of fish populations might be disturbed by a
      long-term exposure to EE2 (> or =10 ng/l) from fertilization until
      sexual maturity.

AB  - A counterpropagation neural network (CPN) was applied to
      predict species richness (SR) and Shannon diversity index (SH) of
      benthic macroinvertebrate communities using 34 environmental
      variables. The data were collected at 664 sites at 23 different
      water types such as springs, streams, rivers, canals, ditches,
      lakes, and pools in The Netherlands. By training the CPN, the
      sampling sites were classified into five groups and the
      classification was mainly related to pollution status and habitat
      type of the sampling sites. By visualizing environmental variables
      and diversity indices on the map of the trained model, the
      relationships between variables were evaluated. The trained CPN
      serves as a 'look-up table' for finding the corresponding values
      between environmental variables and community indices. The output of
      the model fitted SH and SR well showing a high accuracy of the
      prediction (r>0.90 and 0.67 for learning and testing process,
      respectively) for both SH and SR. Finally, the results of this
      study, which uses the capability of the CPN for patterning and
      predicting ecological data, suggest that the CPN can be effectively
      used as a tool for assessing ecological status and predicting water
      quality of target ecosystems.

AB  - Macroinvertebrate communities and environmental variables were
      assessed in an Ankara Stream receiving high organic and industrial
      wastes. Environmental data were used to explain biological variation
      using multivariate techniques provided by the program CANOCO. The
      ordination method CCA (Canonical Correspondence Analysis) was
      applied to evaluate the relationships between environmental
      variables and distribution of macroinvertebrate genera. Data sets
      were classified by TWINSPAN (Two Way Indicator Species Analysis). In
      this investigation, macroinvertebrate communities have been shown by
      CCA ordination to be related to TOM (total organic matter), ammonia,
      cadmium, pH, lead, dissolved oxygen, conductivity (EC), phosphate,
      boron, nitrite and hardness, with TOM, ammonia, cadmium and pH
      emerging as the most significant environmental variables. Epeorus
      was a TWINSPAN indicator for the slightly polluted upstream site 1.
      Physa was a TWINSPAN indicator for the polluted downstream sites.
