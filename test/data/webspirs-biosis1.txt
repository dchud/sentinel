AB: 1158 sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs), excised from patients with primary
  cutaneous melanoma, were assessed pathologically using histology with
  immunohistochemistry (IHC) on all nodes, and RT-PCR for Mart-1 and tyrosinase
  on 55 nodes. RT-PCR was compared with the histology and IHC assessed on the
  same nodes. The evaluation of progressively more detailed protocols for
  histology and IHC modulated by the RT-PCR results led to a procedure that
  consistently detects metastases in 34% of patients submitted to SLN biopsy for
  cutaneous melanomas with a vertical growth phase and a mean thickness of 2.02
  mm (range 0.25, with regression, to 19 mm). As this technique is virtually free
  of false positives and produces only a marginally lower detection rate than RT
  -PCR, which was subject to false positives of 7% in our study, it is suggested
  that this extended protocol should be the basis on which further evaluation of
  the place of RT-PCR in SLN assessment takes place. The evolved protocol
  described here has been adopted by the EORTC as the standard procedure for
  pathological handling of sentinel lymph nodes for melanoma when SLN status is a
  criterion in their clinical trials or studies.

AB: At present there are neither clinical nor experimental data available on the
  influence of technical details on the quality and reproducibility of prostate
  lymphoscintigraphy. Six adult fox hounds received repeated transrectal
  ultrasound guided intraprostatic injections of a technetium 99m labeled
  nanocolloid to prove the influence of different techniques of injection (one
  central injection in both prostate lobes vs two peripheral injections in both
  lobes) on tracer accumulation in sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) and other organs.
  The reproducibility of the favored technique was examined and in a last step it
  was subject to scrutiny following a reduction of the injected volume to 1% of
  the prostate volume. The number of scintigraphically visualized SLN varied
  between four and seven. They were located in the region of the internal and
  external iliac vessels, presacrally, paravesically, and directly
  paraprostatically. In five of six cases, the localization was reproducible both
  with the central application of an identical volume as well as with the volume
  reduced central injection. Tracer accumulation of SLNs and other organs varied
  enormously. We expect that with the combination of both injection techniques,
  even with the reduced injection volume, an optimized prostate
  lymphoscintigraphy will be the outcome.

AB: The aim of our study was to detect micrometastatic breast cancer by
  epithelial glycoprotein-2 (EGP-2) and cytokeratin 19 (CK19), using
  immunostaining and real time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase
  chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Fifty-eight breast cancer patients, 52 primary
  tumors, 75 sentinel nodes (SN) and 149 peripheral blood (PB) samples (from
  before, during and 4 days after operation) were examined. Immunostaining was
  performed with antibodies directed against EGP-2 and CK19. Detection limits
  were one Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF-7) breast cancer cell line
  cell/2.106 leukocytes (immunostaining) and one MCF-7 cell/106 leukocytes qRT
  -PCR. Control noncancer lymph nodes (n=10) showed nonspecific CK19 staining,
  but were qRT-PCR negative; control healthy volunteer PB (n=11) was always
  negative. Primary tumor samples, all positive with immunostaining, showed a
  wide variation of EGP-2 (>104 fold) and CK19 mRNA expression (>103 fold). SN
  (n=19) from 16 patients were tumor-positive with routine haematoxylin-eosin
  (H&E) and/or immunostaining. SN tumor presence was positively correlated to qRT
  -PCR expression, but 3 tumor-positive SN were false negative with qRT-PCR.
  Three SN were qRT-PCR positive, while tumor negative with H&E and/or
  immunostaining. No immunostaining positive PB was observed, but 19 patients
  (33%) had one or more qRT-PCR positive PB samples. We concluded that primary
  tumors have varying expressions of EGP-2 and CK19 mRNA. Both markers can be
  used in qRT-PCR to obtain adequate sensitivity for single tumor cell detection.
  In SN, immunostaining appears more sensitive/specific than H&E or qRT-PCR for
  tumor detection. No immunostaining positivity was found in PB, while 33% of
  patients had qRT-PCR positive PB. The clinical value of these findings will
  have to be clarified.

AB: Background: This study examined whether 3D CT imaging with
  lymphoscintigraphy (LSG) is useful when performing sentinel node biopsy (SNB)
  in a community hospital where radioisotope with gamma-probe (RI method) is
  unavailable. Materials and Methods: From June to November 2002, 35 T1/T2
  clinically node-negative breast cancer patients underwent LSG in a university
  nuclear medicine department. Skin areas above LSG hot spots were marked,
  helical CT scanning was performed and axillary 3D images were created in our
  hospital. The SLN predicted from the 3D images were examined for agreement with
  the dye method. Results: SLNs were detected with dye in 32 out of 35 patients
  (91.4%). In 31 of those 32 (96.9%), the SLN predicted from 3D CT images was the
  same. Even in the 3 dye-negative patients, CT imaging predicted the SLN. SNB
  including sampling was successful in 34 patients (97.1%). Conclusion: 3D CT
  imaging with LSG enables SNB even if the RI method is impossible.

AB: Yaws is no longer a national and international health priority for
  intervention, but there is still a negative perception of the disease in the
  few affected communities. A survey in 1988 in the northern region of Ecuador
  documented a prevalence of 16.5% of clinical cases and 96.3% of serological
  cases. A continuous, long-term community-based surveillance programme was
  therefore put in place focusing on yaws as one of the sentinel diseases. The
  results of this intervention are reported here. In 1993, a second survey showed
  a reduction in the prevalence of clinical cases to 1.4% and of serological
  cases to 4.7%. Between 1993 and 1998, no other clinical cases were detected and
  the serological prevalence in 1998 was 3.5%, corresponding with clinical cases
  of primary or congenital syphilis, latent yaws under follow-up, and individuals
  with low serological titres indicating a 'serological scar'. These data
  indicate that yaws has been eliminated. Another important outcome of the
  intervention is the increased self-confidence in the communities that health
  problems can be tackled.

AB: We report the preclinical testing of a synthetic receptor-binding
  macromolecule, (99mTc)DTPA-mannosyl-dextran (36 kDa, 8 DTPA and 55 mannosyl
  units per dextran, KD = 0.12 nM), for sentinel node detection. Nonclinical
  safety studies included cardiac pharmacology safety studies, acute toxicology
  and pathology studies at 50 and 500 times the scaled human dose in both rats
  and rabbits after foot pad administration, and perivascular irritation studies
  in rabbits following intra-muscular administration at 100 and 1000 times the
  scaled human dose. Biodistribution studies in rabbits at 15 m, 1 h, and 3 h
  indicated that (99mTc)DTPA-mannosyl-dextran cleared the hind foot pad with a
  biological half-life of 2.21 +- 0.27 h. Other than mild hepatocyte hypertrophy
  in rabbits, no abnormalities in toxicology or pathology were found. Intravenous
  administration had no effect on survival, any clinical observations,
  electrocardiograms, or blood pressures. Intramuscular injection had no effect
  on survival, clinical observations, injection site observations, or injection
  site histopathology. The estimated absorbed radiation dose to the affected
  breast was 0.15 mGy/MBq and the effective dose was 1.06 X 10-2 mSv/MBq. This
  preclinical study demonstrates that (99mTc)DTPA-mannosyl-dextran has no
  toxicities and has an acceptable biodistribution and radiation dose.

AB: Objective: To monitor HIV-1 and HIV-2 trends in The Gambia, West Africa.
  Methods: In 1993-1995 a nationwide survey among 29 670 pregnant women attending
  eight antenatal clinics estimated the seroprevalence of HIV-1 at 0.6%, and of
  HIV-2 at 1.1%. Five years later, sentinel surveillance in pregnant women was
  established, using unlinked anonymous testing in four clinics. A dried blood
  spot on filter paper was obtained and tested for HIV antibodies. Results:
  Between May 2000 and August 2001, 8054 analysable samples were collected at
  four sites. The prevalence of HIV-1 rose sharply in one rural area from 0.6 to
  3.0% (P < 0.0001), but the increase was small and non-significant in two other
  rural sites and in the urban site. The prevalence of HIV-2 did not change
  significantly at any of the sites. The overall prevalence of HIV-1 was 1.0%
  (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8-1.3%), and of HIV-2 0.8% (CI 0.6-1.0%). Site,
  nationality and higher age were significantly associated with HIV-1 infection,
  and higher parity and site were significantly associated with HIV-2 infection.
  Conclusion: Fifteen years after the first case of HIV-1 was described in The
  Gambia, the epidemic is still at a low level. There is heterogeneity within the
  country, with one rural area experiencing a fivefold increase in 6 years. The
  prevalence of HIV-2 in The Gambia is stable.

AB: Control of Diaprepes abbreviatus by endemic and exotic entomopathogenic
  nematodes (EPN) was monitored during 2000-2001 in two citrus orchards in
  central Florida (Bartow and Poinciana). Caged sentinel insect larvae were
  buried beneath citrus trees for 7 days at 1 to 2-month intervals from April to
  October each year. At Bartow, the survey occurred in experimental plots that
  were (i) not treated with commercial EPN, (ii) treated twice annually since
  1998 with commercially formulated Steinernema riobrave, or (iii) treated twice
  annually with S. riobrave and liquid fertilization (15 times/year) occurred in
  place of dry fertilizer (3 times/year) used in the other treatments. Four
  endemic EPN species, in addition to S. riobrave, were recovered from the sandy
  soil at Bartow: S. diaprepesi, Heterorhabditis zealandica, H. indica, and H.
  bacteriophora. Mean insect mortality in control plots was 39.4% (range=13% to
  74%), with seasonal maxima in May to July each year. Endemic EPN were recovered
  from 55% (range=22% to 81%) of the cadavers each month. Total numbers of
  endemic EPN recovered in all plots during 2 years were directly related to the
  numbers of adult weevils (D. abbreviatus and Pachnaeus litus) captured in
  modified Tedder's traps and inversely related to recovery of S. riobrave.
  Insect mortality was higher and cadavers containing endemic EPN were more
  numerous in untreated control plots than in S. riobrave-treated plots, except
  during months in which S. riobrave was applied. In treated plots, endemic EPN
  were recovered from cadavers at twice the rate of S. riobrave. Suppression of
  endemic EPN in plots treated with S. riobrave, combined with inferior
  persistence by the introduced species, may have attenuated the net efficacy of
  S. riobrave against D. abbreviatus. In contrast, H. indica was the only endemic
  nematode recovered from the sandy clay loam soil at Poinciana, where the
  average mortality of D. abbreviatus was 12% (range 3% to 20%) and incidence of
  H. indica did not exceed 8%. Results of these surveys suggest that the regional
  patterns in the abundance and damage to citrus caused by D. abbreviatus in
  Florida are regulated by endemic EPN and other soilborne enemies of the weevil.

AB: A field study was performed in southern Alberta, Canada, to assess the
  native wasp, Trichomalopsis sarcophagae (Gahan), as a potential biocontrol
  agent for house fly, Musca domestica L., and stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans
  (L.). The wasp was readily reared in large numbers, which allowed for the
  cumulative release of an estimated 4.63 million wasps into three commercial
  feedlots during the 2-year study. Each of several releases predictably and
  repeatedly enhanced parasitism of sentinel house fly pupae, whereas parasitism
  remained low in three paired control feedlots where wasps were not released.
  Releases every 2nd week had a disproportionately greater effect than releases
  every 2nd month. In 1998, 1.2 million wasps were released into treatment
  feedlots resulting in the recovery of 3 952 T. sarcophagae from 31 500 sentinel
  pupae (0.13 wasps/pupa). In 1999, 3.43 million wasps were released into
  treatment feedlots, with the recovery of 37 763 wasps from 47 720 sentinel
  pupae (0.79 wasps/pupa). Hence, a 2.8-fold increase in the number of wasps
  released in 1999 resulted in a 6.1-fold increase in the recovery of wasps. This
  result supports industry recommendations of regular, repeated releases of wasps
  every 2nd or 4th week versus one or infrequent releases throughout the summer.
  There was no evidence that releases augmented overwintering populations of the
  wasp in subsequent years. These results provide proof-of-concept for the mass
  -rearing and release of T. sarcophagae as an inundative biocontrol agent for
  the control of pest flies in cattle confinements. Further studies will be
  required to assess the effect of T. sarcophagae releases on natural populations
  of pest flies.

AB: The mechanisms by which malignant tumors leave the primary tumor site,
  invade lymphatics, and metastasize to regional lymph nodes (RLNs) are complex
  and interrelated. Although the phenomenon of lymph node metastasis has been
  recognized for over 200 years, the exact mechanisms have only recently been the
  subject of intense interest and sophisticated experimentation. Sentinel lymph
  node biopsy has rapidly entered the clinical mainstream for melanoma and breast
  carcinoma, and this technique has provided confirmation of the orderly anatomic
  progression of tumor cells from primary site to the RLNs through lymphatic
  capillaries and trunks. Exciting studies involving the pathophysiology of
  interstitial fluid pressure in tumors and the peritumoral extracellular matrix
  have focused on lymphatic flow and tumor microenvironment and microcirculation.
  Molecular techniques have led to the definition of unique markers found on
  lymphatic endothelial cells. These markers have enabled scientists to identify
  peritumoral and intratumoral lymphatics and to visualize the ingrowth of tumor
  cells into the lumena of lymphatic capillaries. Tumor-secreted cytokines, such
  as vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF)-C and -D, bind to VEGF receptors
  on lymphatic endothelial cells and induce proliferation and growth of new
  lymphatic capillaries; this process is similar to the well-known mechanism of
  angiogenesis, which results from the proliferation of new blood vessel
  capillaries. Lymphangiogenesis is associated with an increased incidence of RLN
  metastasis, and it is possible that this step is essential to the metastatic
  process. Directional movement toward lymphatics and lymph nodes appears to
  follow a chemokine gradient, and it is likely that some tumor cells that
  express certain types of chemokine receptors are more likely to metastasize to
  the RLNs. In contrast, tumor cells that do not express specific receptors that
  are responsive to lymphatic chemokines may not metastasize. New knowledge
  regarding the molecules involved in these processes should enable improvements
  in prognostic and possibly therapeutic approaches to the management of
  malignant tumors.

AB: Clinical pharmacologists are all dedicated to improving the use of
  medications and decreasing medication errors and adverse drug reactions.
  However, quality improvement requires that some significant parameters of
  quality be categorized, measured, and tracked to provide benchmarks to which
  future data (performance) can be compared. One of the best ways to accumulate
  data on medication errors and adverse drug reactions is to look at medical
  malpractice data compiled by the insurance industry. Using data from PHICO
  insurance company, PHICO's Closed Claims Data, and PHICO's Event Reporting
  Trending System (PERTS), this article examines the significance and trends of
  the claims and events reported between 1996 and 1998. Those who misread history
  are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. From a quality improvement
  perspective, the categorization of the claims and events is useful for
  reengineering integrated medication delivery, particularly in a hospital
  setting, and for redesigning drug administration protocols on low therapeutic
  index medications and "high-risk" drugs. Demonstrable evidence of quality
  improvement is being required by state laws and by accreditation agencies. The
  state of Florida requires that quality improvement data be posted quarterly on
  the Web sites of the health care facilities. Other states have followed suit.
  The insurance industry is concerned with costs, and medication errors cost
  money. Even excluding costs of litigation, an adverse drug reaction may cost up
  to dollar sign2500 in hospital resources, and a preventable medication error
  may cost almost dollar sign4700. To monitor costs and assess risk, insurance
  companies want to know what errors are made and where the system has broken
  down, permitting the error to occur. Recording and evaluating reliable data on
  adverse drug events is the first step in improving the quality of
  pharmacotherapy and increasing patient safety. Cost savings and quality
  improvement evolve on parallel paths. The PHICO data provide an excellent
  opportunity to review information that typically would not be in the public
  domain. The events captured by PHICO are similar to the errors and "high-risk"
  drugs described in the literature, the U.S. Pharmacopeia's MedMARx Reporting
  System, and the Sentinel Event reporting system maintained by the Joint
  Commission for the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations. The information
  in this report serves to alert clinicians to the possibility of adverse events
  when treating patients with the reported drugs, thus allowing for greater care
  in their use and closer monitoring. Moreover, when using high-risk drugs,
  patients should be well informed of known risks, dosage should be titrated
  slowly, and therapeutic drug monitoring and laboratory monitoring should be
  employed to optimize therapy and minimize adverse effects.

AB: Rationale and objectives: To establish the feasibility of using contrast
  -enhanced interstitial ultrasound (US) lymphography as an alternative to
  current sentinel node detection methods. Methods: Aqueous US contrast
  microbubble suspensions of varying diameter were evaluated in vitro to
  characterize response to insonation. Contrast media were then injected
  subcutaneously into the distal extremities of 11 normal dogs to target the
  cervical and popliteal lymph nodes (nodes, n = 40). First-order (sentinel)
  lymph nodes and second-order sublumbar nodes were imaged intermittently from 0
  to at least 120 minutes following contrast injection using continuous power
  Doppler mode. Lymphoscintigraphy studies were performed on 4 dogs to verify
  lymphatic drainage patterns and sentinel lymph nodes. Results: Contrast
  enhancement occurred in 34/40 (85%) sentinel nodes overall and in 30/32 (94%)
  nodes when submicron or near-micron diameter bubble formulations were used. In
  many instances, enhancement persisted throughout the imaging period. Contrast
  response was most pronounced using a high mechanical index and tissue artifact
  was reduced or eliminated when using a high pulse repetition frequency.
  Conclusions: Contrast-enhanced interstitial US lymphography could serve as an
  alternative to current sentinel node detection methods. Preliminary findings
  suggest that submicron or near-micron-diameter bubbles may be suitable for
  lymphatic imaging applications.

AB: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is effective to assess axillary nodal
  status and avoiding axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in patients with
  clinically node-negative early stage breast cancer. No standardization of the
  technique has yet been established. This review discusses the feasibility, the
  accuracy and the different techniques for this procedure. Although the SLN can
  be successfully identified by either the dye or gamma probe-guided method, its
  identification is facilitated when the two techniques are combined. To increase
  the sensitivity of the pathological examination of the SLN, it is necessary to
  make multiple step sections with hematoxylin and eosin staining
  immunohistochemistry on permanent sections. The intraoperative frozen sections
  and imprint cytology examinations of the SLN may be useful in determining its
  status, but further studies are needed to establish their performance. In
  clinical practice, routine ALND can be avoided for small tumours when the
  multidisciplinary team has an extensive experience of this technique. However,
  long-term regional control and survival have to be studied in prospective
  randomised trials, before SLN biopsy can replace routine ALND as the preferred
  staging method for women with localized breast cancer.

AB: Effective preoperative staining of regional lymph nodes improves their
  intraoperative identification and thus the selectivity of "sentinel node"
  lymphadenectomy. Unfortunately, aqueous Patent Blue V (PBV) often fails to
  provide the requisite intensity and duration of contrast (1,2). A comparative
  study of staining characteristics of PBV in aqueous solution with those of
  liposomally encapsulated PBV was carried out on 7 female pigs with an average
  weight of 40 kg. The liposomes, consisting of lecithin and cholesterol in a
  molar ratio of 3:1, were produced by an extrusion technique using membranes
  with thicknesses of 5mum, 1.2mum, 0.4mum and 0.2mum. In each instance, a 0.5-ml
  depot containing 25+-0.4 mg of PBV/ml was injected into each of the four upper
  and lower mammary glands in aqueous solution on the left side and in a
  liposomal preparation on the right side. Stained lymph nodes of the groin,
  pelvis and neck were identified after 3, 6, 12 or 24 hours, then excised and
  photographed. Their PBV concentrations were measured by spectrophotometry. In
  all cases, the liposome preparations provided greater intensity and a longer
  duration than the aqueous solution. Liposomal PBV compared with aqueous PBV can
  therefore be recommended for better preoperative lymph node staining and
  identification of "sentinel" lymph nodes.

AB: In two recent nation-wide outbreaks of mumps in Switzerland two-thirds of
  young children with clinical mumps had a history of primary vaccination. On
  average, measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination coverage is 80%. Two types of
  vaccine are commonly used: Jeryl-Lynn and Rubini. The effectiveness of the
  latter has been questioned in several publications. The authors therefore
  compared Rubini to Jeryl-Lynn in a case-cohort study. The study included 111
  young children with clinical mumps who had been reported to the Swiss Federal
  Office of Public Health (SFOPH) by primary care physicians of the Swiss
  Sentinel Surveillance Network (SSSN) between January 1999 and May 2000.
  Sentinel physicians also sampled 661 children from the same birth cohort as the
  cases. While we found no evidence for the effectiveness of the Rubini strain,
  vaccination with the Jeryl-Lynn strain was 70% effective against clinical
  mumps. Furthermore, children vaccinated with the Rubini strain attended primary
  health care more frequently with clinical mumps than those who had received
  Jeryl-Lynn (odds ratio: 2.4; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.3, 4.7).
  Restricting the analysis to laboratory confirmed cases increased the odds ratio
  to 18.4 (95% CI: 2.5, 811.2). Our study confirms the low effectiveness of the
  Rubini strain vaccine in the field. This vaccine should therefore be considered
  inappropriate for the control and elimination of mumps and its use should be
  discontinued. As other vaccines with comparable quality and safety standards
  and a substantially higher effectiveness are available the MMR vaccination
  program in Switzerland will not be compromised if the use of Rubini is no
  longer recommended.

AB: Integration of individual-based and population-level studies is essential to
  understanding effects of pollution on populations and ecosystems. Here we
  provide an example of such integration from our exploration of effects of the
  Exxon Valdez oil spill (EVOS) on river otters (Lontra canadensis) inhabiting
  the terrestrial-marine interface in Prince William Sound, Alaska, USA. Our
  research was divided into 2 phases: an early phase (1989-92) immediately
  following the oil spill; and a late phase (1996-99), which focused on potential
  chronic effects of oil contamination in the Sound. We used a variety of
  measurements that considered the physiological status and health of individual
  river otters, as well as aspects of their ecology, behavior, and demography. We
  then conducted meta-analysis to explore interactions between individual-based
  and population-level data in demonstrating injury and subsequent recovery of
  otters from ill effects of EVOS. During both phases of our studies, we first
  conducted intensive research at 2 study sites, which we believed to be oiled
  and nonoiled, and then expanded our investigations throughout similar areas of
  Prince William Sound. Nonetheless, our data are best interpreted as differences
  between heavily oiled areas and lightly oiled sites because later information
  indicated that our reference sites were lightly oiled. Thus we refer to heavily
  oiled sites as oiled and lightly oiled sites as "nonoiled." In the later phase,
  we were part of a broader ecosystem-based project (Nearshore Vertebrate
  Predators) designed to assess long-term effects of EVOS on a suite of key
  organisms, and to determine whether those species had recovered from that
  catastrophic accident. We used radiotelemetry to locate carcasses of animals
  that died from natural causes, and documented that searching beaches
  immediately following the spill was not a reliable method for locating dead
  river otters. Our early research (1989-92) demonstrated that river otters
  living in oiled areas had lower body mass (P < 0.04) and elevated biomarkers (P
  < 0.05) in their blood (e.g., haptoglobin (Hp), interleukin-6 immunoreactive
  (IL-6 ir), aspartate aminotransferase (AST)) than otters inhabiting "nonoiled"
  areas. Likewise, otters from oiled areas had higher levels of fecal porphyrins
  (P < 0.001), ate a less-diverse diet (P <0.001), had larger home ranges (P <
  0.05), and selected habitats differently (P < 0.01) than otters living in areas
  that were not heavily oiled. A mark-recapture analysis based on radiotracers in
  otter feces during 1990 indicated no difference (P > 0.10) between density of
  otters in Herring Bay (oiled) or Esther Passage ("nonoiled"), but no prespill
  data were available. Likewise, by 1992, biomarkers (Hp, IL-6 ir, AST) did not
  differ (P > 0.05) between oiled and "nonoiled" areas. During the later phase of
  research, hydrocarbons on the pelage of river otters and the elevation of
  endothelial P450-1A, a biomarker sensitive to hydrocarbon exposure, indicated
  that river otters were exposed to oil still present in Prince William Sound.
  Nonetheless, body mass of otters continued to increase on oiled areas over time
  (P < 0.05), and eventually did not differ from otters living in "nonoiled"
  sites (P > 0.05). All blood biomarkers (Hp, IL-6 ir, AST) were markedly reduced
  from the early phase of our research, and no longer differed (P > 0.10) between
  oiled and "nonoiled" sites. We used principal component analysis (PCA) to
  determine that few differences existed in an array of blood characteristics for
  otters inhabiting oiled and "nonoiled" sites, and those differences that did
  exist likely were related to diet. Corpoporphyrin III, a key biomarker in heme
  synthesis, was reduced (P = 0.008) from post-spill collections made in 1990 in
  the oiled area, and no longer differed (P > 0.05) between oiled and "nonoiled"
  areas in 1996. We used stable isotope analysis to investigate differences in
  diet of river otters inhabiting oiled and "nonoiled" areas in 1996-97. When we
  controlled for otters inhabiting extensive freshwater habitats (which did not
  occur in our early studies), no differences in diet or the trophic level of
  otters were identified (P > 0.20) for otters living in oiled versus "nonoiled"
  sites. Similarly, density of marine fishes (gtoreq8 cm in total length) on
  underwater transects did not differ (P = 0.97) between oiled and "nonoiled"
  areas, although an area by year interaction occurred (P = 0.01). Habitat
  selection by otters also was altered from the early phase; river otters on both
  study areas selected vegetated slopes that were not steep, and selected sites
  with more understory (brush) and greater exposure; selection for those
  characteristics was more pronounced in the oiled area. Otters on both sites
  avoided (use < availability) gravel and small rocks. Although selected
  variables differed between oiled and "nonoiled" sites (P < 0.001), the
  direction of selection did not differ between areas. Moreover, tidal slope did
  not enter any of the models, in contrast to our early studies, indicating that
  differences in selection were not related to avoidance of oiled shores. Home
  -range size declined (P < 0.05) for otters living in oiled areas, and no longer
  differed (P > 0.7) from animals inhabiting "nonoiled" sites. We enumerated
  populations from oiled and "nonoiled" areas using a combination of live
  -captured individuals and DNA fingerprinting using microsatellite from otter
  feces at latrines. We also performed a conventional reconstruction based on age
  structure to calculate population size in 1997. Those methods indicated that
  most animals in the population were recruited following the oil spill and both
  methods characterized slowly (lambda = 1.03-1.06) growing or stable population
  in the oiled area. Age structure of river otters in the Sound differed neither
  between oiled and "nonoiled" areas (P > 0.36), nor from a harvested population
  of river otters in Maine (P > 0.49). Finally, survivorship of river otters did
  not differ (P > 0.2) between oiled and "nonoiled" areas of Prince William Sound
  and was high compared with data on other otter populations in North America.
  Our data indicate that although river otters continued to be exposed to low
  levels of crude oil, effects of that exposure were no longer sufficient to
  cause obvious injury. We cautiously conclude that river otters have recovered
  from the more pernicious effects of EVOS. Based on our experiences in this
  research, we provide theoretical considerations for use of biomarkers in
  wildlife studies and describe statistical approaches, including principal
  component analysis of blood variables, which may assist researchers with
  interpreting complicated results of multiple variables and datasets. Likewise,
  we describe how dose-response curves should be used in understanding population
  -level responses to pollutants. We hope that this monograph will provide
  valuable insights for other wildlife biologists on the process of integration
  of toxicological data with that of ecological data useful for studying effects
  of pollution on wildlife populations and their habitats.

AB: Introduction: The Netherlands Institute of Primary Health Care (NIVEL),
  University of Utrecht, conducted an international scientific project "Health
  Monitoring in Primary Care Based Sentinel Practice Network" in 10 European
  countries, based upon regular and continuous observations of one or more
  diseases. Sentinel practice networks have been established to provide data on
  incidence and other health indicators of the diseases managed predominantly in
  primary care. Department of Family Medicine of the "Andrija Stampar" School of
  Public Health, Zagreb Medical School, participated in the research. Information
  from primary health care is especially useful for diseases mainly diagnosed and
  treated in primary health care. For self-limiting diseases, varicella for
  example, there are no other information sources that would include professional
  judgement and would be available for estimation of incidence and limits of the
  disease in the community. Varicella is a notifiable disease in Croatia;
  however, every infected person does not consult a physician due to a mild or
  uncomplicated nature of the disease, which may cause underestimation of disease
  incidence in the community. Aim: Of this research was to establish incidence of
  varicella as well as incidence of varicella in other family members not seeking
  help from a physician. Methods: Data on patients with varicella were
  retrospectively collected from medical records (incident cases). A prospective
  data collection registered every new case of varicella in the families related
  to the incident case during the period of three weeks before or after the
  incident case (secondary cases). Data on age, gender, and seeking help from a
  physician were collected. Another prospective data collection registered cases
  of varicella in the families with children under 15 years of age and with no
  information on varicella infection in their medical records. Data on age,
  gender, and seeking help from a physician were collected. Results: From January
  1 to June 30, 2000, 19 out of 50 contacted family physicians collected data on
  182 children (52.7% boys) suffering from varicella. Most of them, 84 (46.1%),
  were in the age group 4-6 years; 70 (38.5%) were in the age group 7-15 years,
  and 28 (15.4%) were between 1-3 years of age. Another 103 children were
  registered in the families in the period from three weeks before to three weeks
  after the first case: 43 (41.7%) in the age group 4-6 years, 32 (31.1%) in the
  age group 7-15 years, and 28 (27.2%) between 1-3 years of age. Thirteen
  families had 2 diseased children during that period. In 31 (30.1%) secondary
  cases no physician was consulted. In 95 investigated families, there were 139
  children under 15 years of age with no registered varicella infection; 69 (49%)
  of these children had had varicella and 38 (27%) consulted a physician but had
  not been registered. Most of them, 37 (53.6%), were in the age group 4-6 years;
  19 (27.5%) were in the age group 7-15 years, and 13 (18.9%) between 1-3 years
  of age. Conclusion: Results of this study indicate that a family physician
  should always actively search for secondary cases of varicella in the families
  with one reported case of the disease, and register them in medical records.
  Such records would provide better morbidity registration of the population for
  which a family physician provides care, especially for uncomplicated, self
  -limiting diseases.

AB: Purpose: Flow rates and pressures generated by commercially available
  pleural drainage units (PDUs) and flow rates through available pleural drainage
  catheters (PDCs) are not known. This information may be important clinically
  depending on the volume of air leak associated with a bronchopleural fistula.
  Design: Eight PDUs were assessed for flow rates at various suction levels and
  for the percent accuracy of suction pressures generated at various settings.
  Eleven commonly used PDCs were assessed for flow rates at various suction
  control levels. All devices were donated by their manufacturer. Flow rates and
  pressures were measured by a RT 200 Calibration Analyzer (Timeter Instrument
  Corporation; St. Louis, MO) at body temperature, ambient pressure, saturated
  with water vapor. Five devices of each type were tested. Analysis of variance
  was performed with p<0.05 being significant. Results: Multiple significant
  differences between PDUs were noted at a pressure of -20 cm H2O. The Argyle
  Sentinel Seal (Sherwood Medical; Tillamore, Ireland) had significantly lower
  flow rates (mean+-SD, 10.8+-0.6 L/min) compared with all other models. The
  Argyle Aqua-Seal (Sherwood Medical) had the highest PDU flow rate of devices
  tested (42.1+-1.0 L/min). The accuracy of PDUs at manufacturer-suggested
  settings varied from a mean percentage error of 0.0 to 15.5% from expected
  pressures; significant differences were noted in accuracy among multiple
  interdevice pressure comparisons. Similarly, multiple significant flow rate
  differences between PDCs were noted at -20 cm H2O. Lowest flow rates were noted
  with thoracentesis catheters (used as PDCs) containing side ports. Arrow
  drainage catheters (14F, pigtail and straight) (Arrow International; Reading,
  PA) both had significantly greater flow rates (both, 16.8+-0.1 L/min), compared
  with the 14F (12.8+-0.3) and 16F (14.8+-0.6) Cook devices (Cook; Bloomington,
  IN). Conclusions: These differences in flow rates for PDUs and PDCs may be
  clinically important, particularly in patients with large pneumothorax-related
  air leaks. Observed differences in PDU-generated pressures are likely not
  clinically important.

AB: Objectives: The goal of this study was to identify one or more inguinal
  sentinel nodes in patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva
  and to determine the ability of the sentinel node to predict metastasis to the
  inguinal lymphatic basin. Methods: Techniques employing technetium-99m (Tc-99m)
  sulfur colloid and isosulfan blue dye were utilized to identify sentinel nodes
  in the inguinal lymphatic beds. Technetium-99m sulfur colloid was injected
  intradermally at the tumor margins 90-180 min preoperatively followed by a
  similar injection of isosulfan blue dye 5-10 min before the groin dissection. A
  handheld collimated gamma counter was employed to identify Tc-99m-labeled
  sentinel nodes. Lymphatic tracts that had taken up blue dye and their
  corresponding sentinel node were also identified and retrieved. A completion
  inguinal dissection was then performed. Each sentinel node was labeled as hot
  and blue, hot and nonblue, or cold and blue. The sentinel nodes were subjected
  to pathologic examination with step sections and nonsentinel nodes were
  evaluated in the standard fashion. Results: Twenty-one patients with a median
  age of 79 were entered onto protocol and a total of 31 inguinal node
  dissections were performed. A sentinel node was identified in 31/31 (100%)
  groin dissections with the use of Tc-99m. Isosulfan blue dye identified a
  sentinel node in 19/31 (61%) groin dissections. Surgical staging revealed 7
  patients with stage I disease, 5 with stage III disease, 5 with stage III
  disease, and 4 with stage IV disease. Lymph nodes in 9 groin dissections were
  found to have metastatic disease, and in 4 of these dissections, the sentinel
  node was the only positive node. Lymph nodes in 22 groin dissections had no
  evidence of metastasis. No false-negative sentinel lymph nodes were obtained
  (sentinel node negative and a nonsentinel node positive). Conclusion: Tc-99m
  sulfur colloid is superior to isosulfan blue dye in the detection of sentinel
  nodes in inguinal dissections of patients with vulvar cancer. A sentinel node
  dissection utilizing Tc-99m alone can identify a sentinel node in all inguinal
  dissections. Pathologic examination with step sections has shown the sentinel
  node to be an accurate predictor of metastatic disease to the inguinal nodal
  chain.

  adenoids might lead to new views about the role of innate immunity in the upper
  airway. In this study, the expression of human beta-defensins (HBD) 2 and 3 and
  toll-like receptors (TLR) 2 and 4 in various upper airway diseases was
  investigated. Methods: Surgical samples from patients with tonsillar disease
  (n=18), hypertrophic adenoids (n=10) and sinonasal disease (n=30) (chronic
  sinusitis, nasal polyps, turbinate mucosa as controls) were investigated by
  immunohistochemistry. Quantification of HBD-2 and 3 mRNA, TLR-2 and 4 mRNA
  expression was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results:
  Immunohistochemistry revealed a strong expression of HBD-2 in tonsillar tissue.
  Quantification of HBD-2 and HBD-3 mRNA showed a more than tenfold higher
  expression in tonsillar tissue than in adenoids, whereas in nasal biopsies,
  only negligible defensin expression could be measured. No significant
  differences were found for TLR-4 between the various tissues, whereas TLR-2
  expression in adenoids was significantly lower compared with other tissues.
  Conclusion: These results demonstrate a strong defensin expression in tonsillar
  tissue compared with nasal and paranasal mucosa and adenoids. Toll-like
  receptor expression in all these tissues illustrates a possibly important
  immunological sentinel function of upper airway mucosa.

AB: Microbiologists in 25 sentinel laboratories were each asked to refer up to
  100 clinically-significant Gram-positive bacteria isolated from consecutive
  intensive care unit (ICU) patients. A total of 1595 isolates were collected
  from patients in 23 hospitals; these included Staphylococcus aureus (47.6%),
  coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (30.6%), enterococci (14.3%),
  pneumococci (2.8%) and other streptococci (3.5%). A few coryneforms, other
  bacilli and a Nocardia sp. were also collected. Rates of oxacillin resistance
  among S. aureus and CNS isolates were 59.3 and 78.5%, respectively. Vancomycin
  -resistant S. aureus were not detected, although two isolates (0.3%) were
  resistant to teicoplanin (minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) 8 mg/L). In
  contrast, 13.7% of CNS were teicoplanin resistant (MICs 8-32 mg/L) and 1.2%
  were resistant to vancomycin. Among the enterococci, 72.5% were Enterococcus
  faecalis and 24.5% were Enterococcus faecium, the remainder including isolates
  of Enterococcus casseliflavus or Enterococcus gallinarum. Eighteen percent of
  E. faecium isolates were vancomycin-resistant, compared with only 3% of E.
  faecalis isolates. Rates of high-level gentamicin resistance in E. faecalis and
  E. faecium were 40 and 25%, respectively. Nine percent of pneumococci and
  streptococci were resistant to penicillin, with 7 and 11%, respectively,
  resistant to erythromycin. None of the isolates showed resistance to linezolid,
  with the MICs for the entire study population falling in the range of 0.5-4
  mg/L.

AB: BACKGROUND: Although numerous studies have shown that the status of the
  sentinel node is an accurate predictor of the status of the axillary nodes in
  breast cancer, the efficacy and safety of sentinel-node biopsy require
  validation. METHODS: From March 1998 to December 1999, we randomly assigned 516
  patients with primary breast cancer in whom the tumor was less than or equal to
  2 cm in diameter either to sentinel-node biopsy and total axillary dissection
  (the axillary-dissection group) or to sentinel-node biopsy followed by axillary
  dissection only if the sentinel node contained metastases (the sentinel-node
  group). RESULTS: The number of sentinel nodes found was the same in the two
  groups. A sentinel node was positive in 83 of the 257 patients in the axillary
  -dissection group (32.3 percent), and in 92 of the 259 patients in the sentinel
  -node group (35.5 percent). In the axillary-dissection group, the overall
  accuracy of the sentinel-node status was 96.9 percent, the sensitivity 91.2
  percent, and the specificity 100 percent. There was less pain and better arm
  mobility in the patients who underwent sentinel-node biopsy only than in those
  who also underwent axillary dissection. There were 15 events associated with
  breast cancer in the axillary-dissection group and 10 such events in the
  sentinel-node group. Among the 167 patients who did not undergo axillary
  dissection, there were no cases of overt axillary metastasis during follow-up.
  CONCLUSIONS: Sentinel-node biopsy is a safe and accurate method of screening
  the axillary nodes for metastasis in women with a small breast cancer.

AB: Lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymphadenectomy provide a minimally invasive
  means of directly determining the status of the regional lymph nodes in all
  patients who have a primary melanoma >1 mm thick but no clinical evidence of
  nodal involvement. Since the histological status of the sentinel node (SN) has
  been shown to be the most important prognostic factor in primary melanoma
  patients, the World Health Organization has recently recommended that sentinel
  lymphadenectomy should become the new standard of care for primary melanoma
  patients. This paper reviews the literature with regards to developments in and
  the current status of SN evaluation. Developments in the histopathological
  versus molecular detection of melanoma nodal metastases are reviewed, with
  specific emphasis on the strengths, limitations and clinical significance of
  these techniques. Molecular evaluation of the SN offers several advantages over
  standard histopathological analysis. These include an improved sensitivity, the
  cost-effective use of multiple markers for the improvement of detection rate
  and prognosis, as well as being less labour-intensive and costly. Moreover,
  molecular analysis has the potential to allow estimation of tumour burden. We
  review the potential causes of technical false-negative and false-positive
  reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results and how these
  could be eliminated by a systematic approach consisting of (i) careful and
  systematic assay design, which would include efficient tissue homogenization,
  choice of reagents and molecular markers, primer design and the use of one
  -stage versus two-stage PCR; (ii) careful optimization of the RT-PCR parameters
  (in particular the PCR cycle number) through the use of appropriate control
  tissues; and (iii) aiming for high assay reproducibility and lastly by applying
  the necessary positive and negative controls with each batch of samples. We
  also review the significant improvement in patient prognosis and management
  that has been made possible by the development of sentinel lymphadenectomy and
  histopathological evaluation of the SN, and compare the clinical (predictive)
  value of histopathological analysis with that of RT-PCR. Although RT-PCR is
  able to detect additional, clinically significant SN metastases that are missed
  by routine histopathology, its current limitation is that it overestimates the
  number of patients who have clinically significant melanoma metastases.
  Therefore, we suggest and discuss appropriate steps that need to be taken in
  order to minimize these false-positives and make this molecular tool more
  acceptable for routine clinical use.

AB: Nodal deposits of melanoma may present many years after resection of the
  primary tumour, implying initial suppression of tumour growth with subsequent
  immune escape. Using immunocytochemical techniques on frozen sections, the
  cellular types and activation status of infiltrating cells within a series of
  19 clinically apparent nodal metastases of melanoma were studied. Infiltrating
  cells were assessed using a semiquantitative grading system. Macrophages
  (CD68+) and T-lymphocytes (CD3+) (including both CD8+ and probably also CD4+ T
  -cells) were the predominant cells infiltrating the tumours. B-lymphocytes
  (CD20+) were generally present in low numbers. CD1a+ putative dendritic cell
  density and expression of the early lymphocyte activation markers interleukin-2
  receptor alpha (IL2Ralpha) and CD69 was low. However, greater evidence of
  intermediate lymphocyte activation (CD38) was identified. Expression of
  interleukin-2 (IL2) by tumour-infiltrating cells was not detected. The paucity
  of staining for IL2 and IL2Ralpha, with greater expression of CD38 by
  infiltrating cells, suggests that the usual pathways of lymphocyte activation
  via IL2 were bypassed or impaired within the lymph node metastases. Low numbers
  of CD1a+ putative dendritic cells may result in reduced effector cell
  activation. These findings provide evidence to support the hypothesis that
  antitumour immune responses within clinically involved lymph nodes are reduced
  in metastatic melanoma. This also has possible implications for micrometastases
  to the sentinel lymph node.

AB: Accurate staging of patients with primary cutaneous melanoma includes
  assessment of regional lymph nodes for the presence of micrometastatic disease.
  Sentinel lymph node biopsy is highly accurate but is an invasive surgical
  procedure with a 5-10% complication rate, and requires labour-intensive and
  expensive histological examination to identify disease. A rapid, accurate and
  cost-effective non-surgical technique able to detect micrometastatic deposits
  of melanoma in regional lymph nodes would be of great benefit. Fine needle
  aspiration biopsies and tissue specimens were obtained from lymph nodes from 18
  patients undergoing node resection for metastatic melanoma and five patients
  undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy. One-dimensional proton magnetic
  resonance spectroscopy was undertaken at 360 MHz (8.5 T). Lymph nodes were cut
  into 3 mm thick slices and embedded. Four sequential 5 mum tissue sections were
  cut from each block and stained, with haematoxylin and eosin, for S100 protein,
  for HMB45, and again with haematoxylin and eosin, respectively. Proton magnetic
  resonance spectroscopy distinguished between benign and malignant lymph node
  tissue (P<0.001, separate t-test) and benign and malignant lymph node fine
  needle aspiration biopsy (P<0.012) based on the ratio of the integrals of
  resonances from lipid/other metabolites (1.8-2.5 p.p.m. region) and 'choline'
  (3.1-3.3 p.p.m. region). In conclusion, one-dimensional proton magnetic
  resonance spectroscopy on a simple fine needle aspiration biopsy can
  distinguish lymph nodes containing metastatic melanoma from uninvolved nodes,
  providing a rapid, accurate and cost-effective non-surgical technique to assess
  regional lymph nodes in patients with melanoma.

AB: To assess the efficiency of melanoma screening and prevention campaigns in
  the Auvergne region (France), cases of melanoma have been recorded since 1st
  June 1998. The epidemiological follow-up of melanoma was carried out using two
  sentinel networks; one involving the pathologists, and the other, the
  dermatologists of the region. Incidence was calculated using the capture
  -recapture method, by cross-matching the data supplied by both dermatologists
  and pathologists. Between June 1st 1998 and December 31st 2000, 363 cases of
  melanoma were recorded. The crude incidence rate of melanoma per 100,000 person
  -years was 17.1 for all melanomas and 14.6 for invasive melanomas. These rates
  of incidence were higher than the estimated national rate of France, and were
  close to incidences found in countries of Northern Europe. This might be
  explained by an increase in screening for melanoma, by more precise estimation
  of the incidence due to the capture-recapture method, or by geographic factors
  (mountainous area). An answer may be provided by following the variation in
  time of incidence and thickness of melanomas; the increase in the number of
  thin (low Breslow index) melanomas corresponding with increased screening.

AB: Background: Drug-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a rare life
  -threatening disease characterized by the extensive destruction of the
  epidermis contrasting with the discreteness of lymphoid cell infiltration. The
  precise pathomechanism of the disease remains unclear. Methods: Skin specimens
  and peripheral and thoracic lymph nodes (LNs) were collected from 2 TEN
  patients. They were examined by conventional histology and immunohistochemistry
  using antibodies directed to factor XIIIa (dermal dendrocytes), CD1a
  (Langerhans cells), CD15 (granulocytes), CD20 (B lymphocytes), CD45RO
  (activated T lymphocytes), CD68 (macrophages) and the proliferation marker Ki
  -67. LNs from patients with mycosis fungoides, from subjects dead from acute
  cardiac failure or traumatic injuries, as well as metastasis-free sentinel LNs
  of cutaneous melanoma served as positive and negative controls. Results: TEN
  LNs showed absence of germinal centers but a moderate hyperplasia of the
  paracortical T cell zone. Immunohistochemistry did not reveal any distinctive
  aspect in LN cellular densities between TEN and other control conditions except
  for the factor-XIIIa+ dendritic cells which were dramatically reduced in
  numbers in TEN LNs. This rarefaction in LNs contrasted with the great number of
  these cells in the skin of the same patients. Conclusion: The structure of TEN
  LNs rules out the involvement of an antibody-mediated response. As dendritic
  factor-XIIIa+ cells are involved in most cutaneous T-cell-mediated responses,
  their depletion in TEN LNs could explain the sparse lymphoid cell infiltrate in
  lesional TEN skin.

AB: The aim of the study is to see if Bone Scan (BS) - when performed the day
  before the operation-interferes with the results of the Sentinel Lymph Node
  (SLN) technique using radiocolloids (their pre-operative imaging and their
  perioperative research). Therefore, the data of 393 patients who had one
  selective lymphadenectomy of the SLN(s) followed by the complete axillary node
  (AxN) clearance for Breast Cancer and among whom 309 patients had one BS the
  day before the operation (and just before the injection-s for the SLN) and 84
  did not, were analysed and compared. The two series presented the same
  characteristics with regard to: age, clinical staging of the tumour, kind of
  injection-s performed (intradermic and paratumoural and/or intraparenchymal and
  peritumoral), pathological size of the tumour, percentage of cases with no AxN
  invasion, total number of AxN removed by the surgeons. The percentages of no
  axillary SLN visualisation, the mean numbers of axillary SLN visualised on
  preoperative lymphoscintigram as well as of SLN removed by the surgeons were
  not statistically different in the groups of patients with (respectively,
  12.11, 2.6 and 3.03) and without BS (respectively, 12.99, 2.7 and 2.96). More
  noteworthy, the false negative (FN) rate of the SLN technique, albeit having a
  higher observed value in the group with BS (9.6%, 12/125), did not differ
  significantly from that in the group without BS (5.6%, 2/36). The accuracies
  (overall correct classification rates), the sensitivities and the negative
  predictive values of the SLN technique also did not differ significantly
  between the two groups. It is concluded that the SLN technique can be
  accurately performed just after one BS.

AB: Despite the widespread use of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNBx) in the
  surgical management of breast cancer patients, several areas remain
  controversial. The following controversies are reviewed: Learning curves and
  validation studies. There clearly is a learning curve, and a completion ALND
  should be done until adequate proficiency is exhibited, both in terms of
  identification and false-negative rates. Location of injection. Intradermal
  injection offers superior identification rates compared with peritumoral
  injection, with comparable false-negative rates. Subareolar injection is as
  accurate as peritumoral injection. The value of scintigraphy. Routine
  scintigraphy does not enhance identification or false-negative rates. Mapping
  agents. Blue dye and radioactive tracer combined to provide a higher
  identification rate than either used alone. SLNBx in DCIS. In patients with a
  high risk of microinvasion, such as large tumors, a mass or high-grade DCIS
  -SLNBx is justified. SLNBx following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Although there
  is evidence that SLNBx after neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be accurate, these
  data should be applied cautiously. Implications of non axillary SLN, especially
  internal mammary nodes. Data do not support routine resection of internal
  mammary sentinel lymph nodes outside a clinical trial. Implications of
  micrometastases in the sentinel lymph node seen only on immunohistochemistry.
  Since the significance of such metastases is unclear, decisions regarding
  treatment of these patients should be individualized. The value of completion
  axillary lymph node dissection. Is being addressed in clinical trials. Until
  those studies mature, completion ALND should be performed for patients with SLN
  metastases, but may be abandoned for patients with a negative SLN.

AB: Introduction: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a widely used technique
  for axillary staging in breast cancer patients. The principle to evaluate the
  axillary status of a breast cancer patient with a less invasive surgery than
  axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) meets the new minimally invasive concept
  in breast cancer surgery. Some breast cancer centers proceed to SLNB without
  ALND in SLN-negative patients. Patients and Methods: Between March 1998 and
  March 2002, 500 SLNBs were performed. After a learning period with SLNB and
  ALND in 75 patients with a sensitivity of 96.2% and a false-negative rate of
  3.8%, SLNB alone without further ALND was performed in a group of patients. In
  addition, the feasibility of SLNB in patients with locally advanced breast
  cancer, in patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and in patients with
  multicentricity was evaluated. The combined method with blue dye and technetium
  -99m-labeled human albumin for identification of SLNs was applied. Results: 500
  SLNBs were performed. The identification rate was 86.2%. After exclusion of
  patients with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and patients with multicentricity, the
  identification rate was 94.5%. SLNs were positive in 41.3% of patients and
  negative in 58.7% of patients. Discussion: SLNB is an excellent method for
  axillary staging and an alternative for ALND in a certain group of breast
  cancer patients.

AB: Postoperative quality of life of patients with gastric cancer is becoming
  more important because of the increasing number of patients with early gastric
  cancer and the increase in numbers of long term survivors. Limited lymph node
  dissection (D 1, D 1 + alpha , D 1 + beta), pylorus preserving distal
  gastrectomy, and vagus nerve preserving gastrectomy have been introduced in
  many institutes. Laparoscopic surgery which was started in the early nineteen
  -nineties is now widely performed in Japan. Not only wedge resection of the
  stomach but also gastrectomies with lymph node dissection are able to be
  performed laparoscopically. Establishing the proper indication and techniques
  of sentinel node navigation surgery for early gastric cancer has an important
  role for the limited surgery for gastric cancer and in improving quality of
  life of the patients. Present clinical status and future perspectives of
  treatment of early cancer was described along with the "gastric cancer
  treatment guideline" published in 2001.

AB: Background/Aims: Minimally invasive surgery has been used to improve the
  quality of life after operation in patients with gastric cancer. Sentinel-lymph
  -node biopsy can help to limit the extent of lymph node dissection, but the
  diagnostic and therapeutic usefulness of this technique has not been accurately
  evaluated in gastric cancer. This study was designed to clarify the role of
  intraoperative sentinel-node biopsy in patients with gastric cancer.
  Methodology: We were conducted to evaluate 1) mapping sentinel nodes according
  to tumor location 2) comparison sentinel node metastases as assessed by frozen
  section, permanent section (HE stain) and immunohistochemical diagnoses, and 3)
  comparison non-sentinel node metastases as assessed by permanent section (HE
  stain) and immunohistochemical diagnosis. Results: All sentinel nodes were
  identified in the regional perigastric lymph node group close to the tumor.
  Four of the 43 sentinel lymph nodes were positive for metastasis. Similar
  diagnostic results were obtained by the 3 different procedures. Lymph node
  metastasis was found in 10 (4 sentinel nodes and 6 non-sentinel nodes) of 779
  lymph nodes (1.28%) on HE staining. Immunohistochemical studies revealed a
  similar number of positive sentinel nodes as that obtained on HE staining, but
  identified metastases in 15 in non-sentinel nodes in 2 patients, as compared
  with only 6 nodes on HE staining. In one patient, sentinel nodes at No. 1 and
  No. 3 were negative for metastasis, whereas non-sentinel lymph nodes at No. 3
  were positive for metastasis. The other patient had negative sentinel nodes at
  No. 3 and No. 4d, but positive non-sentinel nodes at No. 4d. Conclusions: The
  results of this small study do not yet provide a firm basis for recommending
  that sentinel-node biopsy is used to reduce the extent of lymph node dissection.

AB: BACKGROUND: The authors evaluated the feasibility of a laparoscopic sentinel
  lymph node (SN) procedure with combined radioisotopic and patent blue labeling
  in patients with cervical carcinoma. METHODS: Thirteen women (median age, 52.5
  years) with cervical carcinoma (Stage Ia2 in 1 patient, Stage Ib1 in 10
  patients, Stage Ib2 in 1 patient, and Stage IIa in 1 patient) underwent a
  laparoscopic SN procedure using an endoscopic gamma probe after both
  radioactive isotope and patent blue injections. After the procedure, all
  patients underwent complete laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy and either
  laparoscopic radical hysterectomy (eight patients) or the Schauta-Amreich
  operation (five patients). RESULTS: SNs (mean, 1.7 SNs per patient; range, 1-3
  SNs per patient) were identified in 12 of 13 patients. A median of 10.5 pelvic
  lymph nodes per patient (range, 4-17 pelvic lymph nodes per patient) were
  removed. No lymph node involvement was detected in SNs with hematoxylin and
  eosin staining. Immunohistochemical studies identified four metastatic SNs in
  two patients, with micro-metastases in two SNs from the first patient and
  isolated tumor cells in two SNs from the second patient. No false-negative SN
  results were obtained. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that SN
  detection with a combination of radiocolloid and patent blue is feasible in
  patients with cervical carcinoma. The combination of laparoscopy and the SN
  procedure permitted minimally invasive management of early-stage disease.

AB: Background and Purpose: The use of lymphadenectomy in renal-cell carcinoma
  (RCC) is controversial. Proponents argue that lymphadenectomy improves
  survival, whereas opponents challenge the procedure on the basis of its
  morbidity and the variable lymphatic drainage of the kidney. Intraoperative
  gamma probes have been used to guide resection of radiolabeled sentinel nodes
  in cancers of the breast, penis, and head and neck and in melanoma. Our goal in
  applying this technique to RCC is to improve detection and to limit sampling of
  lymph nodes during lymphadenectomy. This preliminary study in a porcine model
  evaluated the feasibility and transit time of radiolabeled tracer injected into
  the kidney. Materials and Methods: Data were collected on four 40-kg Yorkshire
  pigs. The right kidney was exposed through a flank incision. Using both blue
  dye and technetium-99m, mapping and resection of the sentinel lymph nodes was
  performed with the assistance of an intraoperative gamma probe (Neoprobe(R)).
  Remote cervical lymph nodes were utilized as controls. Vascular counts along
  the carotid vessels were obtained to confirm that the radioisotope was not
  being dispersed systemically. Results: Within 10 minutes of renal injection of
  the tracer, excised sentinel lymph nodes demonstrated significant radioactive
  counts compared with controls. Vascular counts confirmed that radioisotope
  tracer did not enter the venous circulation. Conclusions: Sentinel lymph node
  sampling using a gamma probe and blue dye appears to be feasible in the porcine
  kidney. Further studies using this technique in humans will evaluate the impact
  of selective lymphadenectomy on survival in RCC.

AB: Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is not uncommon in patients with
  lymphoproliferative disorders, including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The
  association of AIHA with the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma
  subtype however, is rare with only one report found in the English literature,
  involving a patient with a cold autoantibody. We report on a 77 year-old female
  with a remote history of Lyme disease, admitted to our institution for weakness
  and exertional dyspnea. Pallor without lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly
  was noted on exam. Laboratory testing revealed Hb 5.8 g/dl, WBC 10,900/mul,
  platelets 262,000/mul, haptoglobin <4.2 mg/dl, reticulocyte count 3.0%, LDH 677
  U/L. ANA, RF, cryoglobulins and hepatitis serologies were negative. An
  asymptomatic lupus anticoagulant was present. Peripheral smear showed
  spherocytes, polychromasia and few erythrophagocytes. Urine hemosiderin was
  present. The direct antiglobulin test was strongly positive for both IgG and
  C3. The indirect antiglobulin test revealed a Coombs positive panagglutinin and
  an anti-I autoantibody reactive only at 4degreeC. No alloantibodies were
  demonstrated. Body CT demonstrated no masses or adenopathy. Bone marrow
  examination revealed hypercellularity, erythroid hyperplasia and no evidence of
  a clonal or lymphoproliferative disorder by immunophenotypic and cytogenetic
  analyses. Treatment with prednisone (2mg/kg/day), two days of IV gamma-globulin
  (400mg/kg and 800mg/kg) and plasmapheresis did not improve the patient's
  condition. Five additional days of IV gamma-globulin (800mg/kg/day) and
  treatment with danazol (800mg/day) were likewise unsuccessful. The patient
  received a total of eight units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). On hospital
  day 44, splenectomy was done. Pathology was negative for lymphomatous
  infiltration. Steroid therapy could not be discontinued. Two units of PRBCs
  were given on day 63 and the patient was discharged. Persistent hemolysis
  necessitated maintenance therapy over the next six months with prednisone,
  danazol, weekly erythropoietin and six units of PRBCs. Routine mammography at
  this time led to the excision of a left breast mass and sentinel internal
  mammary node. Pathology revealed monotonous monocytoid lymphocytes admixed with
  plasma cells. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated a predominant B-cell phenotype
  (CD 5-, CD 20+, CD 79a+, CD 43+, Ig-). Plasma cells were polyclonal by light
  chain staining. The findings were consistent with a marginal zone B-cell
  lymphoma, extranodal (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type). The lymph node
  was focally involved. Following surgery, prednisone, erythropoietin and PRBC
  transfusions were successfully discontinued and over the next twelve months,
  the patient's mean unsupported Hb was 13.7 g/dl. During this period, she
  received a five week course of fractionated radiotherapy (4,500 cGy) for a
  metastasis discovered in the left axilla. Despite the well established
  association of lymphoproliferative disorders with AIHA, a paucity of reports
  exist linking MALT lymphomas with this entity. The rapid remission of our
  patient's refractory hemolytic anemia following excision of her MALT lymphoma
  suggests the tumor's causative role in her severe AIHA. We believe this case is
  of significant importance as it (1) highlights a previously undescribed
  association of a warm antibody mediated AIHA with MALT lymphoma and (2)
  necessitates that physicians consider MALT lymphomas in the differential array
  of malignancies that can present with AIHA.

AB: A model sentinel plant (phytosensor) capable of signaling pathogen attack in
  the field was obtained by transformation with a construct containing the green
  fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter gene, driven by the promoter of gn1, a
  tobacco beta-1,3-glucanase gene. This is a first step towards the creation of
  sentinel plants for early disease diagnostics with an integral real-time,
  fluorescent-based reporting mechanism. The gn1 promoter is responsive to
  pathogens and salicylic acid (SA), which is synthesized by the plant during
  systemic acquired resistance (SAR). Transgenic plants were sprayed with benzo
  -(1,2,3)-thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid S-methyl ester (BTH), an SA analogue,
  at different stages of development. The presence of GFP transcript in
  transgenic plants after the induction with 5 mM BTH was determined. GFP was
  detected as early as 48 h after induction using Western blot analysis, but the
  fluorescence could not be robustly detected spectrally. Plants younger than 8
  weeks did not express detectable levels of GFP. We show systemic induction of
  gn1/mgfp5-er by BTH in non-treated plant tissues. Time course of induction of
  gn1/mgfp5-er by BTH in transgenic plants showed that induction and GFP
  accumulation was slow and maximum, GFP accumulation was found between 6 and 12
  days after treatment. gn1/mgfp5-er expression was also induced by inoculating
  plant leaves with the pathogen Plectosporium tabacinum.

AB: Sentinel node (SN) biopsy is a promising replacement for standard axillary
  lymph node dissection for the staging of early breast cancer, and various
  techniques have been studied to identify SNs with dye or radioactive colloid.
  This study assesses the effect of the dose of radioactivity and the time before
  biopsy in order to set standards for the use of 99mTc-rhenium sulphide for the
  detection of SNs in breast cancer patients. Sixty patients with stage T1-2 NO
  MO breast cancer underwent SN biopsy, which was immediately followed by
  standard axillary dissection to confirm the SN results. For SN biopsy, 99mTc
  -rhenium colloid was injected peritumorally. A 1 day (morning injection and
  afternoon surgery) or 2 day (day before afternoon injection and morning
  surgery) protocol was applied. A dose-finding study was performed
  simultaneously using 7.4-37 MBq for the 1 day protocol and 37-74 MBq for the 2
  day protocol. A scintigram was taken at 2 h for the 1 day protocol and 16 h for
  the 2 day protocol. After the injection of blue dye, SN biopsy was performed
  with a gamma probe, followed by standard axillary node dissection. The
  radiation exposure received by the surgical team during the operation was
  monitored. Histopathological comparison between SNs and axillary nodes was
  performed. Patient characteristics that might affect the radiocolloid uptake by
  SNs were assessed. SNs were identified in all patients regardless of the dose
  or administration protocol used. Two patients showed false negative
  pathological SN results, and the negative predictive value was 96% and the
  positive predictive value was 100%. In addition, radiation exposure to the
  surgical team and the amount of radioactive surgical waste were low, especially
  at lower doses. Two groups of patient characteristics were related to SN
  uptake. One was the body mass index (BMI) and the other was the age or
  menopausal status. Patients with a larger BMI tended to take up a smaller
  amount of 99mTc colloid. Older or post-menopausal patients showed lower SN
  uptake. 99mTc-rhenium sulphide colloid is an efficient radiopharmaceutical for
  SN detection. Both 1 day and 2 day protocols have equally good efficacy, and
  the recommended dose is 7.4 MBq for the 1 day protocol and 37 MBq for the 2 day
  protocol. Patients with larger BMI and older or post-menopausal patients tend
  to take up less 99mTc colloid.

AB: Lymphoscintigraphy for sentinel node (SN) detection has been studied
  extensively in melanoma and breast cancer. In head and neck squamous cell
  carcinoma (HNSCC), however, experience in this field is relatively meagre. The
  purpose of this study was to document and evaluate lymphoscintigraphic findings
  in HNSCC patients. Eighty-two patients with clinical T1-T4 NO SCC of the oral
  cavity or oropharynx received peritumoral injections of 25-75 MBq 99mTc
  -colloidal albumin (CA). Dynamic lymphoscintigraphy was performed in lateral
  projection for 20 min, followed by 2 min static imaging in anterior projection.
  In 26 patients, additional static images were obtained 2-6 h after injection of
  the tracer. In four of 82 patients, both early and late imaging revealed no
  tracer transport. In 78 of 82 patients, one (60), two (14) or three (4) SNs
  could be visualized, either by dynamic scintigraphy (73) or delayed static
  imaging (5). In 48 of 78 (62%) patients, the SN was visualized within the first
  minute of dynamic imaging. In particular, SNs of tumours of the mobile tongue
  were visualized within the first minute. No effect of T-stage or 99mTc-CA dose
  on the transport time of the tracer towards the SN was seen. The distribution
  of the SNs in the various levels of the neck relative to the primary tumour
  sites within the oral cavity was in concordance with the patterns of lymph node
  metastases reported traditionally for patients with SCC in the oral cavity.
  This study demonstrates the different variables affecting SN identification
  with lymphoscintigraphy using 99mTc-CA in HNSCC patients.

AB: This two-year prospective hospital population-based study of candidaemia is
  the first to be conducted in the UK. It was carried out on behalf on the
  British Society for Medical Mycology (BSMM) as part of the European
  Confederation of Medical Mycology (ECMM) epidemiological survey of candidaemia.
  Six hospitals in England and Wales acted as sentinel hospitals. Main outcome
  measures were hospital population-based incidence and 30-day mortality. There
  were 18.7 episodes of candidaemia per 100 000 finished consultant episodes or
  3.0/100 000 bed days and 45.4% cases occurred in intensive care unit (ICU)
  patients. Candida albicans was isolated in 64.7% of confirmed cases. The
  majority of isolates were sensitive to standard antifungal agents, including
  fluconazole. The overall 30-day mortality was 26.4% and removal of the central
  venous catheter was associated with a significant reduction in mortality. In
  conclusion, the incidence of candidaemia in England and Wales is similar to
  that of the USA, the majority of isolates remain sensitive to commonly used
  antifungal agents and mortality associated with this infection appears to be
  falling.

AB: A one year study (August 1998-July 1999) of bacteremia in febrile children
  was carried out in the Medical Unit (III), Yangon Children's Hospital (YCH),
  Myanmar, to determine: (1) the bacteria responsible for fever of five days or
  more in children; (2) the antibiotic sensitivity pattern of these bacteria.
  Children aged one month to 12 years who had fever for five days or more and who
  did not receive antibiotics within the first 48 hours irrespective of the
  diagnosis were included in this study. A total of 120 patients fulfilled the
  criteria. Bacteria could be isolated from 65 cases (54.2%). The commonest
  organism isolated was Salmonella typhi (43.1%). Others included Escherichia
  coli (12.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (7.7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.7%);
  Streptococcus, Shigella, Diplococcus, Klebsiella and Acinetobacter were also
  isolated. The Salmonella typhi were resistant to conventional antibiotics
  (ampicillin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, and co-trimoxazole); however, they
  were sensitive to amikacin, netilmicin, nalidixic acid, and cephalothin. A
  cluster of enteric fever cases from Mingalartaungnyunt township was noticed and
  was reported to the Directorate of Health. Changes in the incidence and
  etiology of bacteremia in hospitals are well documented. Sentinel surveys of
  bacteremia in major hospitals should be carried out in order to detect the
  changing patterns of bacteremia and antibiotic sensitivity; such surveys will
  be of great help in establishing local antibiotic policies.

AB: Background: We examined the usefulness of a new agent in the mapping and
  dissection of inguinal lymph nodes in the pig. Cy5-cobalamin bioconjugate is
  blue under visible light and fluoresces brilliant red with laser stimulation.
  The wavelength of the emitted red light is sufficiently long that it is visible
  through blood, subcutaneous fat, and fascia. Currently available surgical
  techniques of minimally invasive dissection are well suited for using
  fluorescent detection in a dark operating field with minimal modification of an
  existing Hopkins surgical telescope. Materials and methods: We tested this
  concept in the live post-adolescent, female, nonlactating pig (30 kg). We
  insufflated the subcutaneous tissue over the groin and inserted three ports
  (1X10 mm and 2X5 mm) for dissection. We injected the Cy5-cobalamin bioconjugate
  in a dermal location on the hind limb. A HeNe laser stimulated the
  CobalaFluorTM in the lymphatics and the emitted fluorescence passed through a
  holographic notch filter to a three-chip camera. Results: Under white light,
  the lymphatic trunks and the sentinel node were visualized within minutes of
  injection. Both the lymphatic trunks and the node fluoresced bright red under
  stimulation with red laser light. Conclusions: These preliminary studies
  establish the potential usefulness of this new agent in lymphatic mapping. This
  novel technology might be useful in visualizing cancers that spread to regional
  lymph nodes. This technique has the potential to map the lymphatic drainage and
  to identify the presence of malignant cells in that drainage with currently
  available minimally invasive technology.

AB: Currently, breast cancer patients without clinically suspicious lymph nodes
  are candidates for sentinel lymph node procedures (SLNPs). The aims of this
  study were to investigate whether preoperative axillary ultrasonography and
  fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNA) can reduce the number of the more time
  -consuming SLNPs, and to identify a subset of quantitative nodal features to
  predict metastatic involvement. 268 axillae were ultrasonographically examined.
  FNA was performed on suspicious nodes (smallest diameter gtoreq 5 mm or
  atypical cortex appearance). SLNP was omitted if a tumour-positive node was
  found on FNA. Length, width, maximum cortex thickness and appearance of cortex
  and hilus were ultrasonographically established. In 93 axillae (35%), at least
  one node was detected with ultrasound. FNA was performed once per axilla on 66
  nodes; 37 (56%) contained tumour cells. 31% of all tumour-positive axillae
  (macro- + micrometastases) was found by ultrasound and FNA (37/121). 41% of all
  axillae containing macrometastases was found by ultrasound and FNA (36/87).
  SLNPs were reduced by 14% (37/268). Maximum cortex thickness is the main
  feature to predict metastatic involvement (area under Receiver Operating
  Characteristic (ROC) curve (Az) = 0.87).

AB: Context: Previous investigations on sentinel lymph node biopsies have
  demonstrated their importance in nodal staging of patients with breast cancer.
  However, sentinel node biopsy in breast cancer is currently a controversial
  procedure and continues to provoke debate. Objectives: We designed our study to
  determine the usefulness of a standard protocol for evaluating sentinel lymph
  node metastases and to assess the value of sentinel node biopsy as the only
  procedure in nodal staging in breast cancer patients. Materials and Methods: A
  retrospective analysis of 84 breast cancer patients with sentinel node
  biopsies, who also underwent axillary dissection, was conducted using a
  standard protocol (3 levels of immunohistochemical stains for keratin and 2
  levels of hematoxylin-eosin (HE) stains on the first 3 negative lymph nodes).
  Results: Hematoxylin-eosin staining identified 20 patients (23.8%) with
  sentinel node metastases. The remaining 64 negative patients (76.1%) were tumor
  free on sentinel lymph nodes at level 1 HE. Additional immunohistochemical
  stains for keratin and HE stains on specimens from these 64 patients showed an
  additional 5 patients (7.8%) to be positive for lymph node micrometastases (<2
  mm). The total percentage of cases with sentinel lymph node metastases detected
  by HE staining and immunohistochemistry was 29.7%. Of the remaining 59 cases
  that were negative on HE and immunohistochemistry, axillary dissection revealed
  3 cases that had metastases in the axillary lymph nodes. The false-negative
  rate was 10.7%. The concordance rate between sentinel lymph nodes and axillary
  lymph nodes was 96.4%. The sensitivity was 89% and specificity was 100%.
  Conclusion: Immunohistochemistry and multiple-level sectioning increased
  detection of metastases by 7.8% in sentinel lymph nodes. Caution should be used
  in accepting sentinel node biopsy alone as the only procedure for staging due
  to a high false-negative rate (10.7%). A predictive value of 96.4% confirms
  that sentinel lymph node biopsy is most likely to contain metastatic carcinoma.
  Sentinel lymph node examination with the protocol we describe, combined with
  axillary dissection, increased the yield of metastatic disease by identifying 8
  additional cases of nodal metastatic disease (an increase of 28%), as compared
  to standard axillary nodal dissection and single-section sentinel lymph node
  examination alone.

AB: Context: Nodal staging accuracy is important for prognosis and selection of
  patients for chemotherapy. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping improves staging
  accuracy in breast cancer and melanoma and is being investigated for colorectal
  carcinoma. Objective: To assess pathologic aspects of SLN staging for colon
  cancer. Design: Sentinel lymph nodes were identified with a dual surgeon
  -pathologist technique in 51 colorectal carcinomas and 12 adenomas. The
  frequency of cytokeratin (CK)-positive cells in mesenteric lymph nodes, both
  SLN and non-SLN, was determined along with their immunohistochemical
  characteristics. Results: The median number of SLNs was 3; the median number of
  total nodes was 14. The CK-positive cell clusters were detected in the SLNs of
  10 (29%) of 34 SLN-negative patients. Adjusted per patient, SLNs were
  significantly more likely to contain CK-positive cells than non-SLNs (P<.001).
  Cell clusters, cytologic atypia, and/or coexpression of tumor and epithelial
  markers p53 and E-cadherin were supportive of carcinoma cells. Single CK
  -positive cells only, however, could not be definitively characterized as
  isolated tumor cells; these cells generally lacked malignant cytologic features
  and coexpression of tumor and epithelial markers and in 2 cases represented
  mesothelial cells with calretinin immunoreactivity. Colorectal adenomas were
  associated with a rare SLN CK-positive cell in 1 (8%) of 12 cases. Conclusions:
  Sentinel lymph node staging with CK-immunohistochemical analysis for colorectal
  carcinomas is highly sensitive for detection of nodal tumor cells. Cohesive
  cell clusters can be reliably reported as isolated tumor cells. Single CK
  -positive cells should be interpreted with caution, because they may
  occasionally represent benign epithelial or mesothelial cells.

AB: The objective was to elaborate the descriptive epidemiology of work-related
  cases of reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS). Cases of work-related
  asthma (WRA) were identified in four states in the United States during 1993
  -1995 as part of the Sentinel Event Notification Systems for Occupational Risks
  (SENSOR). Information gathered by follow-back interview was used to describe
  123 work-related RADS cases and to compare them to 301 other WRA cases whose
  onset of disease was associated with a known asthma inducer. RADS represented
  14% of all new-onset WRA cases identified by the state SENSOR surveillance
  systems. RADS cases had significant adverse medical and occupational outcomes
  identified by follow-back interview. In particular, 89% still had breathing
  problems, 78% had ever sought emergency care and 39% had ever been hospitalized
  for work-related breathing problems, 54% had applied for worker compensation
  benefits, and 41% had left the company where they experienced onset of asthma.
  These values equaled or exceeded the comparable figures for those WRA cases
  whose onset was attributed to a known inducer. Work-related RADS represents a
  minority of all WRA cases, but the adverse impact of this condition appears to
  equal that of other WRA cases.

AB: FA and PNH are two conditions associated with potentially life-threatening
  bone marrow failure. Somatic mutations of the PIG-A gene are part of the
  pathogenesis of PNH, but it is uncertain whether they occur as a result of
  intrinsic genomic instability. In contrast, patients with FA have increased
  sensitivity to clastogenic agents and therefore may have an increased
  spontaneous mutation rate. We have developed a robust technique to measure the
  mutation rate (mu) in human B-lymphoblastoid cells (BLCLs) using PIG-A as a
  sentinel gene. Cells are sorted by flow cytometry to eliminate pre-existing GPI
  -negative cells, establishing a large population of GPI-positive (wild type)
  cells, which are then expanded in culture. After several weeks, the cells are
  stained with antibodies specific for CD48, CD55, and CD59 (GPI-linked proteins)
  and HLA-DR (a transmembrane protein) and analyzed by flow cytometry to
  determine the frequency (f) of GPI-negative cells that have arisen as a result
  of spontaneous mutation in culture. The mutation rate is calculated as mu = f /
  d, where d represents the number of cell divisions in culture. In normal
  individuals mu thus measured is from 2.4 to 30 x 10-7 mutations per cell
  division-- a figure consistent with mathematical models. Having generated GPI
  -positive BLCLs from 5 patients with PNH, we determined that mu is in the
  normal range (2-26 x 10-7). In contrast, mu was markedly elevated in cells from
  patients with FA (mean 411 x 10-7, range 36 to 1175 x 10-7, p <0.0001). We
  conclude that the development of PNH is not due to an increased risk of PIG-A
  mutations: rather the rate of PIG-A mutations is normal and expansion of rare
  mutant clones occurs as a result of selection. Conversely, in FA there is no
  such selection and therefore the GPI-deficient cell population does not expand,
  despite an increased mutation rate in PIG-A. In FA, the increased rate of
  spontaneous somatic mutations that we have demonstrated may be key to
  explaining the phenotype of this condition-- particularly stem cell damage and
  the development of malignancy

AB: Dendritic cells are involved in the initiation of both innate and adaptive
  immune responses. Direct contact with many pathogens leads to the maturation of
  DCs, which is characterized by an increase in antigen presentation, expression
  of costimulatory molecules and subsequent stimulation of naive T cells in
  lymphoid organs. We found immature DCs to be activated and to differentiate
  into mature DCs in response to Aspergillus antigens. In contrast, we showed CMV
  infection with certain (endotheliotropic) strains to down-regulate the
  expression of MHC class I and II and of co-stimulatory molecules as well as to
  inhibit DC maturation. Here we used oligonucleotide microarrays to test to what
  extent monocyte-derived immature DCs respond to Aspergillus fumigatus and its
  cell wall components and to HCMV variants. Immature dendritic cells (purity >
  80%) were generated from purified peripheral blood monocytes under serum free
  conditions. DCs were then cultured with Aspergillus hyphae, a protein
  precipitate of Aspergillus fumigatus supernatant (PpSAB), human cytomegalovirus
  strains AD169 and TB40E as well as Pamp3cys, which recognizes and interacts
  with TLR2 and TLR4. As a positive control lipopolysaccharide and as negative
  control mock-infected and unstimulated DCs were used. After incubation for 8 h,
  total RNA was extracted, followed by cDNA synthesis, in vitro transcription
  using biotinylated NTP and hybridization to microarrays for 16 h at 45degreeC.
  To control for DC maturation and stimulation, TNF-alpha and IL12p40 expression
  was documented by real-time RT-PCR. Stimulation experiments with each pathogen
  and component were repeated from four independent donors. Expression analysis
  was perfomed with the Affymetrix Gene Arrays HG U133A. Genes with expression
  level that changed in response to stimuli (termed regulated genes) were
  selected on the basis of repeated differences in the expression levels of the
  treated and untreated samples. Of the 22000 genes represented on the
  oligonucleotide array, in average, a total of 5640 genes changed their
  expression significantly (fold change > 2.0) upon encounter with one of the
  pathogen, more than 100 genes showed an increased expression by a factor of >
  2.5. Such large-sacle change in gene expression demonstrated that DCs are able
  to undergo marked transformation in their cellular phenotype. Analysis of the
  individual responses to pathogens showed that a unique number of genes was
  regulated by each pathogen. Analysis of Aspergillus hyphae and surprisingly
  also PpSAB-specific regulated genes showed that DCs strongly and rapidly up
  -regulated most innate immune genes on the array, including inflammatory
  cytokines, (e.g. GM-CSF, TNalphaF, IL1alpha, IL1beta, IL6), gro oncogenes and
  neutrophil and monocyte-attracting chemokines (e.g. MIP3a, RANTES). DC are
  exquisitely sensitive to different pathogens making them sentinel for innate
  recognition and initiation of Th cell differentiation.

AB: Sentinel lymph node biopsy is changing surgical management of breast cancer
  and pathologic evaluation of lymph nodes. Although it has long been known that
  lymph nodes contain occult metastases, pathologists have not generally pursued
  their identification. Compared with level I-II axillary dissection, the reduced
  number of sentinel lymph nodes has made additional evaluation more attractive;
  however, the consequences of increased detection of micrometastases has not
  been fully explored or appreciated. National data suggest that the composition
  of traditional TNM stage groupings is changing, with a recent increase in node
  -positive, stage II breast cancer, most likely the result of increased
  pathologic scrutiny. Clinical management of this new group of stage II patients
  is complicated by the lack of a historic prognostic comparison group because
  many of these patients would have been classified as stage I, node-negative in
  the past. Early outcome data in sentinel lymph node biopsy suggest no adverse
  outcome for patients with metastases no larger than 2.0 mm, a finding aligned
  with the current definition of micrometastasis. When sentinel lymph nodes are
  sliced at 2.0-mm intervals and totally embedded, the probability of identifying
  all metastases >2.0 mm is high. Using reasonable sampling strategies, minute
  metastases have a nearly equal chance of being missed or detected. New staging
  guidelines have established a lower limit for micrometastases and defined
  metastases no larger than 0.2 mm as isolated tumor cells or tumor cell
  clusters; nodes with isolated tumor cells will be classified as node negative
  (pN0) for stage grouping. Rigorous strategies designed to reliably detect
  single cells or small cell clusters in sentinel nodes remain time-intensive and
  cost prohibitive.

AB: Introduction: Having in mind the promising results of lymphoscintigraphy and
  intraoperative gamma probe application for the detection of sentinel lymph
  nodes (SLN) in malignant melanoma, breast and penis cancer, we tried to
  identify the SLN in prostate cancer by applying a comparable technique.
  Materials and Method: 350 patients with prostate cancer were examined after
  providing informed consent. The day before pelvic lymphadenectomy technetium
  -99m nanocolloid was transrectally injected into the prostate under ultrasound
  guidance. A single central application was done per prostate lobe in most
  cases. Activity attained 90-400 MBq, and the total injected volume was about 2
  -3 ml. Hereafter, lymphoscintigraphy was carried out. Those lymph nodes having
  been identified as SLN by means of gamma probe detection and lymphoscintigraphy
  were removed intraoperatively. Later, most of the cases had different types of
  pelvic lymphadenectomy. SLN received serial sections and immunohistochemistry,
  non-SLN step sections. Results: 335 patients showed at least 1 SLN in
  lymphoscintigraphy. 24.7% had lymph node metastases. In 2 patients, metastases
  in non-SLN were found without at least one SLN being affected (false-negative
  patient). Conclusion: Our experience suggests that the SLN identification is
  not only feasible in breast cancer and malignant melanoma, but also in prostate
  cancer with a comparable technique.

AB: The combination of preoperative lymphatic mapping with intra-operative probe
  detection is becoming the standard procedure for identifying tumour lymphatic
  spread at the time of initial treatment in breast cancer. There are a number of
  identification techniques for sentinel lymph nodes, but the concordance of the
  results of a sentinel lymph node biopsy with axillary lymph node dissection did
  not vary significantly among them. Periareolar (p.a.) injection of tracer is a
  new procedure specifically studied to overcome some limitations of other
  techniques; in two groups of patients with early breast cancer we compared the
  periareolar with the subdermal technique. One hundred and fifty biopsy proven
  breast cancer patients were consecutively enrolled in this study. This
  population was divided into two groups: (1) group A, including 100 cancers;
  lymphatic mapping was performed by s.d. injection of both blue dye and
  radiotracer; and (2) group B, including 50 cancers; lymphatic mapping was
  performed with a combination of blue dye injected p.a. and radiotracer injected
  s.d. For group A, with both techniques we identified one or more SLNs in
  100/100 tumours; blue dye detected the SLNs in 99/100 cancers (99%),
  lymphoscintigraphy in 93/100 cancers (93%). The concordance rate was 92%. For
  group B, with both techniques we identified one or more SLNs in 49/50 cancers
  (98%); blue dye detected the SLNs in 48/50, lymphoscintigraphy in 46/50 cancers
  (92%). The concordance rate was 92%. In the present study p.a. and s.d.
  injection of blue dye give similar and comparable results. The periareolar
  technique is simpler and has several advantages over the subdermal technique.

AB: When many lymph nodes are found by using lymphoscintigraphic techniques
  performed to detect the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in breast cancer, it is
  usual to find that the 'hottest' SLN is not always the node that is
  pathologically positive (pN+). Various criteria have been proposed to define
  which radioactive lymph nodes should be removed. In order to determine the
  frequency with which the hottest SLN 'fails' to be pN+, and to determine which
  criteria best define the radioactive lymph node to be removed, we reviewed and
  analysed our cases in which more than one SLN was detected and where there was
  also at least one pN+ node. From a series of 181 patients, 40 were selected. In
  11 of these 40 cases (27.5%), the hottest SLN was not pN+. Radioactivity levels
  in the pN+SLN of these 11 patients ranged from 2% to 94% of the activity of the
  hottest SLN. Twenty-one patients (52.5%) showed only micrometastatic (pN1a)
  disease in one or more SLNs. In four of these patients (19%) the pN1a SLN was
  not the hottest node. Two of the patients had radioactivity levels in the
  pN+SLN which were more than 50% of that of the hottest SLN. In another two of
  these patients (9.5%), radioactivity levels were lower than 50% of that of the
  hottest node (respectively, 38% and 2%). However, in these two last cases, the
  first and hottest SLN removed surgically was found, by the pathologist, to
  consist of six nodes. Macrometastases (dimensions greater than 2 mm) were found
  in 19 patients. In 12 of these patients, the hottest SLN was macrometastatic
  although macrometastases and/or micrometastases were found in other 'cooler'
  SLNs in four of them. In another seven of these patients (36.8%),
  macrometastases were found in SLNs with radioactive levels lower than 51% of
  that of the hottest node. One patient (with three SLNs) out of the 40 (2.5%)
  had one SLN pN+ with less than 10% of that of the hottest. In fact, it
  contained only one micrometastasis and its activity was equal to 2%. Upon
  pathological examination, however, the hottest lymph 'node' was found to
  consist of six nodes. It is concluded that, with four intra-mammary and
  peritumoural injections of 99mTc labelled nanosized colloids of Human Serum
  Albumin (Nanocoll R: Sorin: 74 MBq and 0.05 mg per injection) performed 18-24 h
  before using a gamma probe to detect the SLNs, the hottest SLN was not the
  pathologically positive node in 27.5% of patients in our series. By using the
  activity in the hottest SLN as the reference point, and 10% of this activity as
  the lower threshold for removing active SLNs, the sensitivity of the technique
  is 97.5%.

AB: Background: Fluconazole (FLU) is standard therapy for many Candida
  infections, increasing the importance of monitoring changes in Candida species
  distribution and in vitro FLU susceptibility. We report 5 year trends from a
  global surveillance study. Methods: From January 1997-December 2001, 4000
  clinical isolates of Candida spp. were submitted from 94 centers in 29
  countries. Species identification and in vitro susceptibility testing (by NCCLS
  M-27A broth microdilution method) were performed in a central lab. NCCLS
  breakpoints for FLU were used. Results: The overall species distribution was:
  56% C. albicans, 16% C. glabrata, 13% C. parapsilosis, 10% C. tropicalis and 2%
  C. krusei. No major changes in species distribution by year were seen either
  overall or within regions (US, Canada, Latin America and Europe). Specifically,
  the proportion of isolates identified as C. glabrata or C. krusei did not
  change over time (p=0.3 for trend by year). C. albicans remained highly
  susceptible (S) to FLU (MIC90, 0.5 mug/mL, 99% S), and among all species
  combined, only 3% were FLU resistant (R). No significant change in overall mean
  FLU MIC by year was noted during the study period (p=0.4). The new triazoles
  voriconazole (VORI) and posaconazole (POSA) were very active against FLU S
  Candida (MIC90, 0.12 mug/mL), less active against FLU S dose-dependent Candida
  (MIC90, 1 mug/mL), and least active against FLU R Candida (MIC90, 8 mug/mL for
  VORI, 16 mug/mL for POSA). The only Candida spp. for which cross-resistance was
  not seen was C. krusei, against which both VORI and POSA had good activity
  (MIC90, 0.5 mug/mL). Conclusions: Five years of sentinel surveillance have not
  shown major changes in species distribution or FLU susceptibility among Candida
  spp. Some cross-resistance exists between FLU and the new triazoles for Candida
  other than C. krusei.

AB: Context: In the United States, the annual incidence of myocarditis is
  estimated at 1 to 10 per 100000 population. As many as 1% to 5% of patients
  with acute viral infections involve the myocardium. Although many viruses have
  been reported to cause myopericarditis, it has been a rare or unrecognized
  event after vaccination with the currently used strain of vaccinia virus (New
  York City Board of Health). Objective: To describe a series of probable cases
  of myopericarditis following smallpox vaccination among US military service
  members reported since the reintroduction of vaccinia vaccine. Design, Setting,
  Participants: Surveillance case definitions are presented. The cases were
  identified either through sentinel reporting to US military headquarters
  surveillance using the Defense Medical Surveillance System or reports to the
  Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System using International Classification of
  Diseases, Ninth Revision. The cases occurred among individuals vaccinated from
  mid-December 2002 to March 14, 2003. Main Outcome Measure: Elevated serum
  levels of creatine kinase (MB isoenzyme), troponin I, and troponin T, usually
  in the presence of ST-segment elevation on electrocardiogram and wall motion
  abnormalities on echocardiogram. Results: Among 230734 primary vaccinees, 18
  cases of probable myopericarditis after smallpox vaccination were reported (an
  incidence of 7.8 per 100 000 over 30 days). No cases of myopericarditis
  following smallpox vaccination were reported among 95 622 vaccinees who were
  previously vaccinated. All cases were white men aged 21 years to 33 years (mean
  age, 26.5 years), who presented with acute myopericarditis 7 to 19 days
  following vaccination. A causal relationship is supported by the close temporal
  clustering (7-19 days; mean, 10.5 days following vaccination), wide geographic
  and temporal distribution, occurrence in only primary vaccinees, and lack of
  evidence for alternative etiologies or other diseases associated with
  myopericarditis. Additional supporting evidence is the observation that the
  observed rate of myopericarditis among primary vaccinees is 3.6-fold (95%
  confidence interval, 3.33-4.11) higher than the expected rate among personnel
  who were not vaccinated. The background incidence of myopericarditis did not
  show statistical significance when stratified by age (20-34 years: 2.18
  expected cases per 100 000; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.90-2.34), race
  (whites: 1.82 per 100 000; 95% CI, 1.50-2.01), and sex (males: 2.28 per 100
  000; 95% CI, 2.04-2.54). Conclusion: Among US military personnel vaccinated
  against smallpox, myopericarditis occurred at a rate of 1 per 12819 primary
  vaccinees. Myopericarditis should be considered an expected adverse event
  associated with smallpox vaccination. Clinicians should consider
  myopericarditis in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with chest
  pain 4 to 30 days following smallpox vaccination and be aware of the
  implications as well as the need to report this potential adverse advent.

AB: Context: The United States recently implemented smallpox vaccination of
  selected military personnel in a national program of preparedness against use
  of smallpox as a biological weapon. The resumption of smallpox vaccinations
  raises important questions regarding implementation and safety. Objective: To
  describe the US military smallpox vaccination program. Design: Descriptive
  study of the vaccination program from its inception on December 13, 2002,
  through May 28, 2003. Setting: US Department of Defense (DoD) fixed and field
  medical treatment facilities on multiple continents and ships at sea. Subjects:
  US service members and DoD civilian workers eligible for smallpox vaccination.
  Main Outcome Measures: Numbers of vaccinations and rates of vaccination
  exemptions, symptoms, and adverse events. Data were collected via reports to
  headquarters and rigorous surveillance for sentinel events. Results: In 5.5
  months, the DoD administered 450293 smallpox vaccinations (70.5% primary
  vaccinees and 29.5% revaccinees). In 2 settings, 0.5% and 3.0% of vaccine
  recipients needed short-term sick leave. Most adverse events occurred at rates
  below historical rates. One case of encephalitis and 37 cases of acute
  myopericarditis developed after vaccination; all cases recovered. Among 19461
  worker-months of clinical contact, there were no cases of transmission of
  vaccinia from worker to patient, no cases of eczema vaccinatum or progressive
  vaccinia, and no attributed deaths. Conclusions: Mass smallpox vaccinations can
  be conducted safely with very low rates of serious adverse events. Program
  implementation emphasized human factors: careful staff training,
  contraindication screening, recipient education, and attention to bandaging.
  Our experience suggests that broad smallpox vaccination programs may be
  implemented with fewer serious adverse events than previously believed.

AB: In 1999-2001, a national measles control strategy was implemented in Uganda,
  including routine immunization and mass vaccination campaigns for children aged
  6 months to 5 years. This study assesses the impact of the campaigns on measles
  morbidity and mortality. Measles cases reported from 1992 through 2001 were
  obtained from the Health Management Information System, and measles admissions
  and deaths were assessed in six sentinel hospitals. Measles incidence declined
  by 39%, measles admissions by 60%, and measles deaths by 63% in the year
  following the campaigns, with impact lasting 15 to 22 months. Overall, 64% of
  measles cases were among children <5 years of age, and 93% were among children
  ltoreq15 years old. The cost per child vaccinated was dollar sign0.86. Routine
  immunization coverage remained low, at 61% in 2001. To eliminate measles in
  Uganda, routine immunization should be strengthened, campaigns should be
  conducted among those <15 years of age, and nationwide case-based measles
  surveillance should be put in place.

AB: New surgical oncology techniques, such as lymphatic mapping and sentinel
  node biopsy, require precise identification of the presence of even very small
  numbers of tumor cells. The gold standard for such analysis remains microscopic
  assessment of tissue sections, stained conventionally or by
  immunohistochemistry for appropriate tumor markers. This approach is limited by
  sampling constraints and requires a high degree of expertise from the
  microscopist. Recent studies have demonstrated a subgroup of patients whose
  sentinel nodes are negative on microscopy, but whose nodes yield an enhanced
  signal for melanoma markers when evaluated by RT-PCR. These enhanced signals
  reflect a mixture of signal sources, including small numbers of melanoma cells
  and cells other than melanoma cells that express the relevant markers(s).
  Because the preparative techniques for RT-PCR destroy the structural integrity
  of the tissues and disrupt individual cells, the exact cellular source of
  enhanced signal from a tissue cannot be demonstrated by conventional RT-PCR. RT
  in situ PCR, in which the RT-PCR technique is applied on a tissue section, does
  identify the cells that are the source of signal. We have attempted to optimize
  this interesting approach and have applied it to the detection of relevant
  melanoma markers in tissue culture lines.

AB: A patient with an accessory breast on the anterior abdominal wall was found
  to have cancer of this tissue, because of its unusual position it was decided
  that lymphatic mapping was necessary to identify the lymphatic drainage of this
  tumour. A metastasis was found in a sentinel node deep to the 'true'
  ipsilateral breast; however, the sentinel node identified in the axilla of this
  patient was free of metastases. The use of the sentinel node technique up
  staged the cancer from I to II and the patient went on to have adjuvant
  treatment with chemotherapy. The use of lymphatic mapping and sentinel node
  biopsy in the case of cancer of an accessory breast allows more accurate
  determination of lymph node status.

AB: This review surveys the staging systems used for the classification of
  colorectal carcinomas, including the TNM system, and focuses on the assessment
  of the nodal stage of the disease. It reviews the quantitative requirements for
  a regional metastatic work up, and some qualitative features of lymph nodes
  that may help in the selection of positive and negative lymph nodes.
  Identification of the sentinel lymph nodes (those lymph nodes that have direct
  drainage from the primary tumour site) is one such qualitative feature that is
  claimed to allow the upstaging of colorectal carcinomas via an oriented,
  enhanced pathological work up. Current evidence in favour of a change in the
  requisite of assessing as may lymph nodes as is possible, and concentrating the
  efforts on only a selected number of lymph nodes, is weak.

LA: English
AB: An essential prerequisite for a successful sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)
  procedure is an accurate map of the pattern of lymphatic drainage from the
  primary tumor site in each patient. In melanoma patients, mapping requires high
  -quality lympho-scintigraphy, which can identify the actual lymphatic
  collecting vessels as they drain into the sentinel lymph nodes. Small-particle
  radiocolloids are needed to achieve this goal, and imaging protocols must be
  adapted to ensure that all true sentinel nodes, including those in unexpected
  locations, are found in every patient. Clinical prediction of lymphatic
  drainage from the skin is not possible. The old clinical guidelines based on
  Sappey's lines therefore should be abandoned. Patterns of lymphatic drainage
  from the skin are highly variable from patient to patient, even from the same
  area of the skin. Unexpected lymphatic drainage from the skin of the back to
  sentinel nodes in the triangular intermuscular space and, in some patients,
  through the posterior body wall to sentinel nodes in the paraaortic,
  paravertebral, and retroperitoneal areas has been found. Lymphatic drainage
  from the head and neck frequently involves sentinel nodes in multiple node
  fields and can occur from the base of the neck up to nodes in the occipital or
  upper cervical areas or from the scalp down to nodes at the neck base,
  bypassing many node groups. The sentinel node is not always found in the
  nearest node field and is best defined as "any lymph node receiving direct
  lymphatic drainage from a primary tumor site." Lymphatic drainage can occur
  from the upper limb to sentinel nodes above the axilla. Drainage to the
  epitrochlear region from the hand and arm as well as to the popliteal region
  from the foot and leg is more common than was previously thought. Interval
  nodes, which lie along the course of a lymphatic vessel between a lesion site
  and a recognized node field, are not uncommon, especially in the trunk.
  Drainage across the midline of the body is quite common in the trunk and in the
  head and neck. Micrometastatic disease can be present in any sentinel node
  regardless of its location, and for the SLNB technique to be accurate, all true
  sentinel nodes must be biopsied in every patient.

AB: Molecular methods, including DNA probes, were used to identify and enumerate
  pathogenic Vibrio species in the Chesapeake Bay; our data indicated that Vibrio
  vulnificus exhibits seasonal fluctuations in number. Our work included a
  characterization of total microbial communities from the Bay; development of
  microarrays that identify and quantify the diversity of those communities; and
  observation of temporal changes in those communities. To identify members of
  the microbial community, we amplified the 16S rDNA gene from community DNA
  isolated from a biofilm sample collected from the Chesapeake Bay in February,
  2000. The resultant 75 sequences were 95% or more similar to 7 species
  including two recently described Shewanella species, baltica and frigidimarina,
  that have not been previously isolated from the Chesapeake. When the genera of
  bacteria from biofilm after culturing are compared to those detected by
  subcloning amplified 16S fragments from community DNA, the cultured sample
  exhibited a strong bias. In oysters collected in February, the most common
  bacteria were previously unknown. Based on our 16S findings, we are developing
  microarrays to detect these and other microbial species in these estuarine
  communities. The microarrays will detect each species using four distinct loci,
  with the multiple loci serving as an internal control. The accuracy of the
  microarray will be measured using sentinel species such as Aeromonas species,
  Escherichia coli, and Vibrio vulnificus. Using microarrays, it should be
  possible to determine the annual fluctuations of bacterial species (culturable
  and non-culturable, pathogenic and non-pathogenic). The data may be applied to
  understanding patterns of environmental change; assessing the "health" of the
  Bay; and evaluating the risk of human illness associated with exposure to and
  ingestion of water and shellfish.

AB: We describe the first documented field transmission of West Nile (WN) virus
  by a North American mosquito. WN was first detected in northern Florida in
  2001. An intensive mosquito trapping and surveillance program was conducted in
  this region for four nights to assess mosquito transmission of WN. Four
  mosquito traps, each with a single sentinel chicken, were placed at five
  different locations on each of four nights. A total of 11,948 mosquitoes was
  collected, and 14 mosquito pools were found to contain WN, giving a minimum
  infection rate between 1.08 and 7.54 per 1,000. Only one of the 80 sentinel
  chickens seroconverted to WN, demonstrating a single mosquito transmission
  event during the study and a mosquito transmission rate of between 0.8 and 1
  per 1,000. Culex nigripalpus Theobald was responsible for WN transmission to
  the sentinel chicken, although both Cx. nigripalpus and Culex quinquefasciatus
  Say were found infected with WN. Mosquito transmission rates are reported in
  this study for the first time for a WN outbreak. This information is essential
  to determine risk of human and animal infection.

AB: Incursions of Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus into northern Queensland are
  currently monitored using sentinel pigs. However, the maintenance of these pigs
  is expensive, and because pigs are the major amplifying hosts of the virus,
  they may contribute to JE transmission. Therefore, we evaluated a mosquito
  -based detection system to potentially replace the sentinel pigs. Single,
  inactivated JE-infected Culex annulirostris Skuse and C. sitiens Wiedemann were
  placed into pools of uninfected mosquitoes that were housed in a MosquitoMagnet
  Pro (MM) trap set under wet season field conditions in Cairns, Queensland for
  0, 7, or 14 d. JE viral RNA was detected (cycling threshold (CT) = 40) in
  11/12, 10/14, and 2/5 pools containing 200, 1,000, and 5,000 mosquitoes,
  respectively, using a TaqMan real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain
  reaction (RT-PCR). The ability to detect virus was not affected by the length
  of time pools were maintained under field conditions, although the CT score
  tended to increase with field exposure time. Furthermore, JE viral RNA was
  detected in three pools of 1,000 mosquitoes collected from Badu Island using a
  MM trap. These results indicated that a mosquito trap system employing self
  -powered traps, such as the MosquitoMagnet, and a real-time PCR system, could
  be used to monitor for JE in remote areas.

AB: Although cardioviruses related to Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus
  (TMEV) appear to be common in mice and rats, few TMEV isolates have been
  obtained from rat colonies. In 1991, a cardiovirus isolate designated NGS910
  was obtained from sentinel rats exposed to cage bedding previously used by
  adult rats that were TMEV seropositive, but had never manifested clinical signs
  of disease. To determine to which group and subgroup of cardiovirus this virus
  belongs, the sequence of the viral genome was determined. The NGS910 genome
  consisted of 8,021 nucleotides and the 5'-nontranslated region had a predicted
  secondary structure that is similar to members of the TMEV group of
  cardioviruses. The Leader-P3D open reading frame (L ORF) of NGS910 had strong
  homology with L ORFs of other TMEVs (72% identity), but lower homology with
  EMCV cardioviruses (55 to 56%). Phylogenetic analyses on the basis of aligned
  nucleotide sequences of the L ORF (6,924 b) and the internal L* ORF (471 b)
  supported this classification of NGS910 as a TMEV strain. However, within the
  TMEV group, NGS910 was sufficiently divergent from other isolates that it could
  not be regarded as simply a mutant strain of a known TMEV. As genetic distances
  between NGS910 and other TMEVs were greater than those between Mengo virus of
  EMCV and other EMCVs, we propose to designate the NGS910 isolate as a rat
  Theiler-like virus.

AB: Little information is available in the United States regarding the incidence
  and distribution of diseases caused by critical microbiologic agents with the
  potential for use in acts of terrorism. We describe disease-specific,
  demographic, geographic, and seasonal distribution of selected bioterrorism
  -related conditions (anthrax, botulism, brucellosis, cholera, plague,
  tularemia, and viral encephalitides) reported to the National Notifiable
  Diseases Surveillance System in 1992 to 1999. Tularemia and brucellosis were
  the most frequently reported diseases. Anthrax, plague, western equine
  encephalitis, and eastern equine encephalitis were rare. Higher incidence rates
  for cholera and plague were noted in the western United States and for
  tularemia in the central United States. Overall, the incidence of conditions
  caused by these critical agents in the United States is low. Individual case
  reports should be considered sentinel events. For potential bioterrorism
  -related conditions that are endemic and have low incidence, the use of
  nontraditional surveillance methods and complementary data sources may enhance
  our ability to rapidly detect changes in disease incidence.

AB: Background. Nodal status is an important prognostic factor in oral cancer.
  Sentinel node studies may enable accurate identification of high-risk nodes
  without a formal neck dissection. Imprint cytology is an emerging tool to
  assist in the rapid intraoperative detection of nodal metastases with
  encouraging results in other solid tumors. This study was planned to evaluate a
  novel method of intraoperative staging using sentinel node biopsy and
  intraoperative imprint cytology in oral cancer. Methods. Thirty-two cases of
  oral cancer underwent sentinel node mapping using 1% isosulfan blue during the
  study period. The sentinel node was sent for evaluation by imprint cytology.
  The average time taken for reporting was 15 minutes. The result was compared
  with the final histopathology, which was taken as the "gold standard." Results.
  Sentinel nodes (SLN) were identified in 30 cases (93.75% identification rate),
  with two false negatives. Intraoperative imprint cytology (IIC) could
  accurately predict the nodal status in 28 of the 30 patients. There was one
  false-positive result and one false-negative result. The overall sensitivity,
  specificity, and accuracy of IIC were 87.5%, 95.4%, and 93.3 %, respectively.
  Conclusion. Sentinel node biopsy along with IIC provides a reliable,
  inexpensive, and accurate method of intraoperative identification of the nodal
  status in oral cancer.

AB: Sentinel node (SN) status is the most important prognostic factor for
  localized melanoma. Usually, patients with Breslow thickness of less than 1.0
  mm are not included in SN protocols. However, the literature presents a rate
  ranging from 3 to 7% of nodal recurrence in thin melanoma. Ulceration,
  regression and high mitotic rate have been considered to be indications for an
  SN biopsy. The metastatic potential of the vertical growth phase is uncertain.
  To correlate pathological features in thin melanoma with SN metastasis, we
  reviewed 358 patients submitted to SN biopsy. Seventy-seven patients with
  lesions of 1 mm or smaller were included in the study group. Histological
  evaluation of the primary tumor included thickness, Clark level, mitotic rate,
  ulceration, regression, and growth phase. Lymphoscintigraphy was performed on
  all patients. Lymphatic mapping and gamma probe detection were both used for SN
  biopsy. Histological examination of SN consisted of hematoxylin-eosin and
  immunohistochemical staining. Median follow-up was 37 months. Six patients had
  micrometastases. Statistical analysis by the Fisher test showed that ulceration
  (P=0.019), high mitotic rate (P=0.008) and vertical growth phase (P=0.002) were
  positively correlated with micrometastases. If other studies confirm these
  results, more melanoma patients must be submitted to SN biopsy.

AB: Three porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV)
  recombinants, generated by mutagenesis of an infectious cDNA clone of the
  Lelystad virus (LV) isolate, were tested for their safety and protective
  efficacy as potential PRRSV vaccines in pigs. Recombinant vABV688 contains two
  amino acid substitutions in the minor structural protein GP2 resulting in
  improved growth on cell line CL2621; in recombinant vABV707 the region encoding
  the ectodomain of the major unglycosylated membrane protein M has been replaced
  by that of the murine lactate dehydrogenase-elevating arterivirus; recombinant
  vABV746 lacks the six C-terminal amino acids of the nucleocapsid protein N.
  First, we determined the safety of these recombinant viruses by monitoring the
  stability of the introduced mutations in 8-week-old pigs. We showed that the
  introduced genomic mutations were maintained throughout the viraemic period.
  Second, the protective efficacy of immunization with the recombinant viruses
  against challenge with a homologous and a heterologous PRRSV strain was
  determined in two pigs and compared with the efficacy of vABV437, a virus
  derived from the parental LV cDNA. The viraemia in pigs immunized with the
  recombinant viruses was reduced compared to pigs immunized with vABV437. In
  addition, the length of viraemia was reduced in the sentinel pigs that were
  introduced into the groups immunized with vABV746, vABV688, and vABV707,
  however, all of the sentinel pigs became infected. Pigs immunized with vABV707
  and vABV437 were protected against challenge with homologous virus LV-Ter
  Huurne and transmission of the latter virus. None of the immunized pigs were
  protected against heterologous challenge with the virulent US isolate SDSU73,
  but the vABV707- and vABV746-immunized pigs were protected against transmission
  of this virus from challenged pigs. In conclusion, the obtained viral
  recombinants are interesting candidates to be further explored for their use as
  vaccines against PRRSV.

AB: A vaccine is now available to prevent varicella-zoster infection, but its
  place in routine preventive care is not yet determined. The age specific
  incidence of shingles was examined separately by gender and age groups (15-24,
  25-44, 45-64, 65-74 and 75 years and more) over the years 1994-2001. These
  incidence data were applied to national available data for the UK on current
  life expectancy to calculate the risk of shingles infections at varying ages.
  The potential benefit of an effective vaccine was estimated using three models
  of vaccine efficacy applied separately to males and females at ages 50, 60 and
  65 years and assuming vaccination at a single age. Similar calculations were
  made using a two dose strategy at age 45 and 65 years and at age 50 and 70
  years. The cost per case saved was estimated from a vaccination cost of pnd40
  per dose. The probability of having had an attack of shingles before age 45
  years is 8.6% for males and 10.5% for females, The risk of acquiring shingles
  over an expected lifetime (assuming no preventive vaccination) for males aged
  45 years is 22% and for females 32%. Whichever vaccine efficacy model was
  chosen, a single vaccination policy at age 65 years was the most favourable
  option in both males and females. A two age vaccination policy was estimated to
  increase the cost per case saved by 30% over a single age policy but
  administration at age 50 and 70 years substantially increased the number of
  cases saved as compared with a single age policy and was potentially better
  than vaccination at 45 and 65 years.

TI: The tattooing paradox: Are studies of acute hepatitis adequate to identify
  routes of transmission of subclinical hepatitis C infection?

AB: Background: The Hepatitis Branch of the Centers for Disease Control and
  Prevention does not recommend routine regulation and inspection of tattoo
  parlors because surveillance of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive acute
  hepatitis cases rarely identifies tattooing in the incubation period. However,
  the majority of seroepidemiological studies agree that tattooing is a strong,
  independent risk factor for subclinical HCV seropositivity. We postulated that
  this paradox might be explained if transmission of HCV by tattooing generally
  caused subclinical HCV seropositivity without the acute hepatitis syndrome.
  Methods: We reanalyzed data from a prior seroepidemiological study of 626
  consecutive patients who were unaware of their HCV serologic status and whose
  risk factors were ascertained by interview of an internist. Separate multiple
  logistic regression models were developed to predict a history of the acute
  hepatitis syndrome and HCV seropositivity. Results: A history of injection-drug
  use was strongly associated with both HCV seropositivity (adjusted odds ratio
  (AOR), 7.2; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.1-16.5) and a history of acute
  hepatitis (AOR, 5.9; 95% CI, 2.5-13.8), whereas having a commercially applied
  tattoo was strongly associated with HCV seropositivity (AOR, 6.5; 95% CI, 2.9
  -14.4) but not with a history of acute hepatitis (AOR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.5-3.3).
  Conclusions: Intravenous injection of relatively large quantities of innocula
  of HCV may be more likely to result in the relatively rare acute HCV hepatitis
  syndrome, whereas intradermal exposure to small quantities of innocula may
  cause only subclinical HCV infections. If so, public policy on regulation and
  inspection of tattoo parlors should be determined by seroepidemiological
  studies rather than by the Sentinel Counties Study of acute hepatitis cases.

AB: Background: Positive sentinel node biopsy or clinically/radiologically
  demonstrable lymph node metastases in patients with malignant melanoma
  establishes the indication for inguinal dissection. Currently the deep (pelvic)
  part of the dissection is the subject of lively discussion. For the past 3
  years we have been carrying out all pelvic lymph node dissections using an
  endoscopic extraperitoneal approach in combination with conventional
  superficial inguinal dissection. Methods: In analogy to endoscopic
  extraperitoneal hernia repair we open the extraperitoneal space with the aid of
  a dissection balloon and then perform a complete dissection of the para-iliac
  and obturator lymph nodes. The superficial part of inguinal dissection is then
  carried out in the conventional manner. Results: Among a total of 31
  consecutive dissections performed on 30 malignant melanoma patients between
  April 1999 and June 2002 neither intraoperative nor postoperative complications
  of the endoscopic part of the dissection were observed. Conclusions: While
  enabling better local tumor control as a result of the complete dissection,
  this modification entailing the use of endoscopic pelvic dissection also
  appreciably reduces the extent of operative trauma without compromising
  oncological radicalness or increasing morbidity. We recommend this approach to
  all surgeons with experience with endoscopic extraperitoneal procedures for use
  in patients requiring inguinal dissection.

AB: The occurrence of vesicular stomatitis (VS) was investigated in El Salvador
  through monthly visits to 12 sentinel cattle operations located in four
  different departments. Management, environmental, and spatial data were
  collected. Heifers were enrolled on the operations and were examined and bled
  monthly for 3 years. Two competitive ELISAs were used to detect antibodies on
  each sample for each serotype of VS virus (VSV). On 8 of the 12 operations,
  small terrestrial rodents were trapped, blood samples collected, and antibodies
  to both VS serotypes evaluated using a serum-neutralization test for each virus
  serotype. Similar to other studies of VS in Central America, the seroprevalence
  of the New Jersey serotype was higher than the seroprevalence to the Indiana
  serotype. An outbreak of VS appeared to occur in the Department of Sonsonate in
  the summer of 1999. We confirmed that VS is endemic in the four departments
  investigated in El Salvador.

AB: Objective: To determine the feasibility of intraoperative radioisotopic
  mapping using an endoscopic gamma probe associated with patent blue dye
  injection in patients with early stage cervical cancer. Methods: Between April
  2001 and March 2002 a total of 12 patients underwent laparoscopic bilateral
  pelvic lymphadenectomy (squamous carcinoma in 10 cases, all stage FIGO IB1, and
  adenocarcinoma in 2 cases, stages IA2 and IB1). Lymphoscintigraphies were
  performed on the day before surgery to visualize sentinel lymph nodes, 31+-22.5
  and 174+-34 min after injection of 200 muCi of technetium 99m rhenium sulfur
  colloid. The marker was injected at the 3, 6, 9, and 12 o'clock positions. The
  day of surgery 2 ml of patent blue dye plus 2 ml of physiological serum was
  injected in the cervix, at the same locations as the radioactive isotope
  injection. Results: A total of 35 sentinel lymph nodes were detected. Eight
  sentinel lymph nodes were only detected by color, 8 sentinel lymph nodes were
  only detected by the endoscopic gamma probe, and 19 sentinel lymph nodes were
  "hot and dyed." We found 3 metastatic lymph nodes. In one case, bilateral
  positive sentinel nodes were only detected by the endoscopic gamma probe.
  Permanent section identified one inframillimetric micrometastasis in a lymph
  node that was neither blue nor hot intraoperatively (sensitivity=66%,
  specificity=100%, positive predictive value=100%, negative predictive
  value=90%). Conclusion: The identification of the sentinel lymph node with blue
  dye and radioisotope using an endoscopic gamma probe is feasible and improves
  detection rate. False negatives still occur, but the proportion is low even at
  the beginning of the learning curve. Isotopic imaging identifies nodes in areas
  outside the pelvis not routinely sampled in early cervical cancer patients.

AB: Background: In primary cutaneous melanoma, the sentinel node (SN) biopsy is
  an accurate method for the staging of the lymph nodes. Positron emission
  tomography (PET) has been suggested as a useful alternative. However, the
  sensitivity of PET may be too low to detect SN metastases, which are often
  small. Aim: To predict the value of PET for initial lymph node staging in
  melanoma based on morphometric analysis of SN metastatic load, without exposing
  patients to PET. Material and methods: In 59 SN positive patients with
  melanoma, the sizes of tumour deposits in the SNs and subsequent dissection
  specimens were measured by morphometry and correlated with the detection limits
  of current and future PET scanners. Results: The median tumour volume within
  the basin was 0.15 mm3 (range, 0.0001-118.86). Seventy per cent of these
  deposits were smaller than 1 mm3. State of the art PET scanners that have a
  resolution of about 5 mm would detect only 15-49% of positive basins. Logistic
  regression analysis revealed no pretest indicators identifying patients
  expected to have a positive PET. However, the SN tumour load was a significant
  and single predictor of the presence of PET detectable residual tumour.
  Conclusion: Morphometric analysis of metastatic load predicts that PET scanning
  is unable to detect most metastatic deposits in sentinel lymph nodes of
  patients with melanoma because the metastases are often small. Therefore, the
  SN biopsy remains the preferred method for initial regional staging.

  anatomy of the upper aerodigestive tract (UADT), there is less detailed
  knowledge of the architecture and drainage patterns of the lymphatic system.
  Detailed knowledge of the lymphatic system is critical for understanding the
  role of sentinal node identification in the management of different cancers.
  Methods. We have combined microscopic techniques with in vivo and in vitro
  lymphographic studies to survey the architecture and drainage patterns of the
  lymphatic system of the UADT in 850 organ specimens. Results. These studies
  show an interaction of superficial and deep lymphatic networks that vary in
  density but have a constant distribution characterized by predictable patterns
  of lymph drainage into the regional lymph nodes. Conclusions. Detailed
  knowledge of the lymphatic system of the UADT contributes to a better
  understanding of the patterns of metastatic spread of carcinomas of the UADT
  and provides a strong rationale for the practice of sentinel node
  identification in the management of these tumors.

AB: The ability to detect gamma ray passage through fatty tissue has biomedical
  applications in the diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer. The uptake of a
  99mTc-labeled sulfur colloid solution into the primary or sentinel lymph nodes
  (SLN) supplying the breast is one mechanism by which potential metastasis is
  being assessed. If gamma-rays from the decaying 99mTc could be measured
  externally, the invasiveness of this diagnostic procedure would be greatly
  reduced. Using a 57Co source, this experiment assessed gamma-ray intensity
  attenuation through porcine fatty tissue for thickness up to 76 mm. The porcine
  tissue accounted for a significant attenuation of intensity, but further
  significant losses were seen due to the increase in distance between the
  detector and the 57Co Source. It was found that porcine fatty tissue has gamma
  -ray attenuation properties nearly identical to that of breast tissue. From the
  porcine tissue study and subsequent observation of three SLN biopsy procedures,
  it was found that detecting SLN's via external gamma-ray detection is not self
  -sufficient. The use of a blue dye as an adjunct diagnostic tool is also
  necessary for the high success rate desired. While an external gamma-ray
  detection method will not replace the traditional SLN biopsy procedure, it may
  serve as a pre-operative tool to limit the invasiveness of the procedure.

AB: Tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAF) and tumor-associated macrophages are the
  main stromal components in desmoplastic breast tumors. These host cell types
  were extensively studied individually with regard to tumor development and
  progression but little is known about their reciprocal interactions. To
  elucidate the role of TAF in the recruitment of monocytes (MO) we designed a 3D
  co-culture system of multicellular fibroblast spheroids of different origin, co
  -cultured with MO suspensions from healthy donors. Spheroids of tumor-derived
  but not of normal fibroblasts were extensively infiltrated by MO. A linear
  correlation between number of infiltrated MO and number of MO applied per
  spheroid was shown, indicating a distinct migratory MO subpopulation
  (apprxeq15%) within the peripheral blood MO pool. Our data imply that MO
  migration into fibroblastic tumor areas may partially result from high
  expression of CCL2 (monocyte chemotactic protein-1), which was regulated by
  endogenous IL-6 as shown by neutralization experiments. The effect of CCL2 on
  MO migration was inhibited by CCL2 neutralizing antibody in tumor-derived
  fibroblast conditioned media in a Boyden chamber migration assay but not in
  spheroid culture. While this phenomenon needs further evaluation, our data
  clearly support the concept of fibroblasts as "sentinel cells" relevant for
  tumor progression.

AB: Background: Resistance imperils medicine and so demands close surveillance,
  which may best be achieved by sentinel surveys (for quality) together with
  routine data gathering (for quantity). Methods: In 2001, the British Society
  for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) commissioned a sentinel surveillance of
  bacteremias, with 24 laboratories in the UK and Ireland each collecting 10
  consecutive isolates of each of the commonest agents. These were tested
  centrally by the BSAC agar dilution MIC method and categorised by BSAC
  breakpoints. Simultaneously, the Public Health Laboratory Service LabBase
  system collected routine susceptibility data (generated and interpreted by
  local standards) from most laboratories in England and Wales, with 57994
  bacteremia reports from >200 labs in 2001. Results: Linezolid resistance was
  not found in any of the sentinels' gram-positive isolates, and imipenem
  resistance was not found in Enterobacteriaceae except Proteeae, whereas LabBase
  recorded 1-3% imipenem resistance in other Enterobacteriaceae. Conclusion:
  Comparison of sentinel and routine data gave good agreement for most
  drug/organism combinations. Exceptions may indicate quality problems with
  routine data, or biases in the sentinel sampling. Identification of such
  disagreements (e.g. with penicillin and pneumococci) allows investigation and
  corrective action.

AB: BACKGROUND. Several subtypes of sweat gland carcinoma have been found to
  demonstrate a propensity to metastasize systemically and to regional lymph
  nodes. The predictive value and benefit of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy
  have been established in numerous other malignancies, but to the authors'
  knowledge there is little literature published to date regarding the use of SLN
  biopsy in patients with sweat gland carcinoma. In the current study, the
  authors demonstrated the utility of SLN biopsy in detecting subclinical
  metastases of sweat gland carcinoma, which may result in early treatment.
  METHODS. The authors identified five patients with malignant eccrine tumors in
  whom SLN biopsy was performed at the study institution. Clinical and
  histopathologic data were reviewed. RESULTS. The five study cases included two
  cases of aggressive digital papillary adenocarcinoma (both occurring on upper
  extremity digits), two cases of hidradenocarcinoma (occurring on the knee and
  foot, respectively), and an eccrine carcinoma (occurring on the scalp). In each
  biopsy-established case, there was no clinical evidence of metastatic disease,
  and a wide local excision or amputation was performed with concurrent SLN
  biopsy. Four of 18 SLNs in 3 of the 5 patients (60%) were found to be positive
  for metastatic carcinoma, as identified in hematoxylin and eosin stains and/or
  cytokeratin immunohistochemical stains. All three lymph node-positive patients
  subsequently underwent regional lymphadenectomy and were found to have no
  evidence of additional metastases. CONCLUSIONS. The results of the current
  study demonstrate that SLN biopsy detects subclinical metastases from sweat
  gland carcinomas to regional lymph nodes. SLN mapping and biopsy at the time of
  resection can provide useful information with which to guide early treatment.
  Further studies are necessary to determine whether this procedure results in a
  survival benefit in patients with sweat gland carcinomas.

AB: BACKGROUND. Sentinel lymph node mapping and biopsy (SLNB) has become a
  standard staging procedure for patients with cutaneous neoplasms of known
  metastatic potential. In the current study, the authors explored the use of
  SLNB in patients with primary sweat gland carcinomas (SGCs). METHODS. Six
  patients with SGC underwent SLNB. The tumors and lymph nodes were examined
  using routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections and by
  immunohistochemistry using antibodies against epithelial membrane antigen and
  cytokeratins. RESULTS. Metastases were detected in the SLNs of four of the six
  patients with SGC. One patient with a primary tumor of the neck was found to
  have bilateral positive SLNs. Tumor deposits were detected by H&E stained
  sections alone in all but two SLNs, in which the metastatic cells were
  recognized only with the aid of immunohistochemical stains. Positive non-SLNs
  were found in two patients after complete regional lymph node dissection was
  performed. CONCLUSIONS. The high frequency of positive SLNs in this small
  series suggests that SLNB is a useful staging tool for patients with SGC. As in
  SLNBs of other tumors, immunohistochemistry appears to facilitate the
  recognition of small microscopic metastases.

AB: Pandemic influenza is a zoonosis. Studies on influenza ecology conducted in
  Hong Kong since the 1970s in which Hong Kong essentially functioned as an
  influenza sentinel post indicated that it might be possible, for the first
  time, to have influenza preparedness at the baseline avian level. This
  appreciation of influenza ecology facilitated recognition of the H5N1 'bird
  flu' incident in Hong Kong in 1997 in what was considered to be an incipient
  pandemic situation, the chicken being the source of virus for humans and, if
  so, was the first instance where a pandemic may have been averted. The 2001 and
  2002 H5N1 incidents demonstrated that it was possible to have an even higher
  order of baseline preparedness with the recognition in chicken of a range of
  genotypes of H5N1-like viruses before they had the opportunity to infect
  humans. Investigations of these incidents revealed a complex ecology involving
  variously precursor avian H5N1 virus in geese and ducks, and H9N2 and H6N1
  viruses in quail, the quail possibly functioning as an avian 'mixing vessel'
  for key genetic reassortment events for onward transmission of H5N1 viruses
  highly pathogenic for chicken and humans. These findings highlight the
  importance of systematic virus surveillance of domestic poultry in recognizing
  changes in virus occurrence, host range and pathogenicity as signals at the
  avian level that could presage a pandemic. For example, there is now an
  increasing prevalence of avian influenza viruses in terrestrial (in contrast to
  aquatic) poultry. Prior to 1997, no particular virus subtype other than H4N6
  would have been considered a candidate for pandemicity and this was based, in
  the absence of any other data, on its high frequency of occurrence in ducks in
  southern China. Now, with the isolation of H5N1 and H9N2 viruses from humans
  supported by genetic, molecular and biological studies on these and other avian
  isolates, there is credible evidence for the candidacy, in order, of H5N1, H9N2
  and H6N1 viruses. These viruses have been made available for the production of
  diagnostic reagents and exploratory vaccines. The 1997 incident upheld the
  hypothesis that southern China is an epicentre for the emergence of pandemic
  influenza viruses. However, the intensification of the poultry (chicken)
  industry worldwide coupled with the spread of viruses such as the Eurasian
  lineage of H9N2 suggest that the genesis of a pandemic could take place
  elsewhere in the world. This re-emphasizes the importance of systematic virus
  surveillance of poultry globally for international public health and for
  economic and food concerns. Faced with an incipient pandemic in 1997, Hong Kong
  brought in international experts to join the investigative effort. Good
  teamwork at all levels is essential in dealing with the many facets. The threat
  of a pandemic should not be minimized, nor should governments be lulled into a
  sense of false security. The media is a powerful channel and has the
  responsibility and the avenues to convey and influence public perception of
  events. Close liaison between the media and those on the operational side
  ensures effective, accurate and timely dissemination of information. This will
  enhance public confidence in the investigative process and in steps taken for
  its safety and health.

AB: The movement of populations shapes the patterns and distribution of
  infectious diseases globally. The consequences of travel are seen in the
  traveller and in places and populations visited and may persist long after
  travel. The traveller can be seen as an interactive biological unit who picks
  up, processes, carries and drops off microbial genetic material. A traveller
  can introduce potential pathogens in the absence of signs or symptoms of
  illness. Travellers can serve as a sentinel population; study of them can
  provide insights into the presence and level of risk of transmission of
  infections in other geographical regions. Travellers can also be seen as
  couriers who inadvertently ferry pathogens and microbial genetic material to
  regions where researchers can carry out detailed analyses that can help to map
  the location and movement of strains, genotypes and resistance patterns. The
  laboratory plays a key role in the identification and characterization of
  pathogens, which can inform management of individual patients and the public
  health response. The connectedness and mobility in the world today facilitate
  the emergence of infectious diseases in humans and also in animals and plants.
  Many traditional barriers have been breached by travel, roads and technology.
  Population size and density favour spread of many infections. The rapid
  generation time of microbes and their capacity to adapt to changes in the
  physico-chemical and immunological environment will pose continuing challenges.

AB: Understanding the mode of action of carcinogens is critical to
  scientifically assessing exposure-related risk. Regulatory hazard
  classification schemes and dose-response assessment paradigms generally require
  basic knowledge of genotoxic potential to guide decisions on which scheme or
  paradigm is most appropriate. Although convention suggests that classification
  and dose-response assessment of genotoxic chemicals should be assessed using
  conservative assumptions of no threshold, several examples, such as vinyl
  acetate, exist that challenge this assumption. Vinyl acetate is carcinogenic at
  portals of entry (nasal cavity and upper gastrointestinal tract). Local
  metabolism of vinyl acetate produces DNA-reactive acetaldehyde but also
  produces acetic acid and protons, which contribute to intracellular
  acidification, cytotoxicity and cell proliferation. This paper reviews their
  relative contributions to the overall mode of action. Elevated cellular
  proliferation, well understood to be a risk factor for carcinogenesis, is
  observed at concentrations associated with tumor formation. Cytotoxicity and
  compensatory tissue regeneration is one pathway for stimulating cellular
  proliferation while intracellular acidification is a mitogenic stimulus. Both
  of these pathways may be operative in nasal tissues while mitogenic
  proliferation alone appears to be induced in the upper gastrointestinal tract.
  Using a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model, quantitative relationships
  between critical tissue dosimeters and tissue responses are developed to assess
  the relative importance of genotoxicity and cell proliferation in the overall
  mode of action of vinyl acetate. This approach supports the concept that
  intracellular acidification is the sentinel response that precedes cytotoxicity
  and cellular proliferation. Secondarily, the carcinogenic potential of vinyl
  acetate is expressed only when tissue exposure to acetaldehyde is high and when
  cellular proliferation is simultaneously elevated. This mode of action suggests
  that exposure levels that do not increase intracellular acidification beyond
  homeostatic bounds will be adequately protective of adverse downstream
  responses including cancer. These mechanistic insights provide the scientific
  basis for a cancer classification that incorporates thresholds for cytotoxic
  and/or mitogenic cell proliferation secondary to intracellular acidification.

AB: Objective To examine the progress made towards the Safe Motherhood
  Initiative goals in three areas of the United Republic of Tanzania during the
  1990s. Methods Maternal mortality in the United Republic of Tanzania was
  monitored by sentinel demographic surveillance of more than 77 000 women of
  reproductive age, and by prospective monitoring of mortality in the following
  locations: an urban site; a wealthier rural district; and a poor rural
  district. The observation period for the rural districts was 1992-99 and 1993
  -99 for the urban site. Findings During the period of observation, the
  proportion of deaths of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) due to maternal
  causes (PMDF) compared with all causes was between 0.063 and 0.095. Maternal
  mortality ratios (MMRatios) were 591-1099 and maternal mortality rates
  (MMRates; maternal deaths per 100 000 women aged 15-49 years) were 43.1-123.0.
  MMRatios in surveillance areas were substantially higher than estimates from
  official, facility-based statistics. In all areas, the MMRates in 1999 were
  substantially lower than at the start of surveillance (1992 for rural
  districts, 1993 for the urban area), although trends during the period were
  statistically significant at the 90% level only in the urban site. At the
  community level, an additional year of education for household heads was
  associated with a 62% lower maternal death rate, after controlling for
  community-level variables such as the proportion of home births and
  occupational class. Conclusion Educational level was a major predictor of
  declining MMRates. Even though rates may be decreasing, they remained high in
  the study areas. The use of sentinel registration areas may be a cost-effective
  and accurate way for developing countries to monitor mortality indicators and
  causes, including for maternal mortality.

AB: We studied metal contamination of streams in the forestry dominated and
  close-on pristine subcatchments in Finland and Russian Karelia. In this area,
  atmospheric deposition and point loading are insignificant as sources of
  metals, while geochemical sources and silvicultural activities are important.
  Aquatic moss Fontinalis antipyretica Hedw. was used as a sentinel organism
  measuring the metal contamination. Tufts of Fontinalis were collected at 10
  Russian and 8 Finnish stream sites for the measurement of whole-plant Al, Fe,
  Cd, Zn, Cu, Pb and Ni concentrations. The average Al, Fe, Cd, Cu, Zn and Ni
  concentrations were statistically significantly higher in the Finnish moss
  samples than in the Russian ones. In particular, concentrations of Al, Fe, Cu,
  Ni and Zn in many Finnish streams clearly exceeded natural background
  concentrations and were comparable to the earlier results from streams affected
  by metal loading from point and non-point sources. The results suggest that
  silvicultural practices in combination with specific geochemical features may
  cause metal contamination of streams in areas considered otherwise unpolluted.
  We stress the importance of taking precautions against forestry-induced metal
  contamination.

AB: BACKGROUND. Dissection of the "sentinel lymph node" (SLN) as identified by
  lymphoscintigraphy is becoming increasingly important in the treatment of
  patients with malignant melanoma. The purpose of the current study was to
  determine whether the SLN also could be identified by ultrasound. METHODS.
  Sixty-seven patients with malignant melanoma (40 females and 27 males, with an
  average age of 48.8 years) in whom extirpation of the SLN was indicated
  underwent ultrasonography of the regional lymph nodes prior to preoperative
  lymphoscintigraphy. The location of the melanoma was the legs in 30 patients,
  the arms in 14 patients, and the trunk in 23 patients. During regional
  ultrasonography, the location of the lymph nodes that differed in the
  cortex/medulla ratio from the surrounding lymph nodes was marked on the skin
  corresponding to the planes of insonation (M1) when the probe was held
  vertically to the skin surface. After lymphoscintigraphy using technetium-99m,
  the position of a gamma probe at which the highest count rate vertical to the
  skin surface was recorded also was marked (M2). RESULTS. In the inguinal
  region, the agreement between M1 and M2 was found to be 100% (40 of 40 SLNs)
  and was 72.5% in the axilla (29 of 40 SLNs). In patients with melanomas located
  on the leg, the location of M1 and M2 agreed in 97% of cases (36 of 37 lymph
  nodes in 30 patients); in patients with melanomas located on the arms, the
  agreement was 76% (13 of 17 lymph nodes in 14 patients) and in patients with
  melanomas located on the trunk, the agreement was 75% (21 of 28 lymph nodes in
  23 patients). The position documented by ultrasound relative to the neighboring
  structures of the SLN was confirmed intraoperatively in all cases. CONCLUSIONS.
  The results of the current study indicate that the SLN in patients with
  melanoma located on the limbs, especially the legs, are characterized by a
  specific sonomorphologic pattern. Preoperative sonography might constitute an
  important addition to lymphoscintigraphy in the planning of SLN biopsy.

AB: This report traces the evolution of surveillance programmes for influenza in
  the United Kingdom and countries of western Europe since the World Health
  Organisation (WHO) resolution to establish an international influenza reference
  centre in 1947. The introduction of clinical surveillance schemes in the late
  1960s and their gradual integration with laboratory-based surveillance is
  described, with particular emphasis on the need for integrated surveillance
  based on population-specific denominators. The function of the European
  Influenza Surveillance Scheme (EISS), its work programme in the last 5 years,
  and the likely direction of future developments is outlined. The report
  advocates the EISS model of influenza surveillance, which involves the
  integrated collection of clinical and laboratory data in the same population
  using sentinel practitioners.

AB: The incidence of malignant melanoma (MM) is continuing to rise, although
  childhood MM remains rare. We describe an 8-year-old Afro-Caribbean girl who
  developed a non pigmented lesion on the tip of her left thumb, which persisted
  despite treatment in primary care with cryotherapy. At biopsy she was found to
  have an acquired acral MM. She underwent amputation of the distal phalanx of
  her thumb, together with positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy and
  subsequent axillary lymph node clearance and adjuvant chemotherapy. MMs are
  very rare in this age and skin-type group, therefore requiring strict
  diagnostic criteria. These criteria include the distinction from MM mimics,
  especially Spitz tumours, and an appropriate use of staging techniques such as
  SLN biopsy to influence management.

AB: In 1998 the New South Wales (NSW) Health Department funded the development
  and implementation of the State's first standardized methodology for the
  surveillance of healthcare-associated infection for public hospitals. Fifteen
  pilot hospitals targeted inpatient groups considered to represent their core
  patient groups to act as sentinel measurements of patient safety. The
  aggregated rates of surgical site infection for coronary artery bypass graft
  (CABG) (chest & leg) surgery was 1.7% (95%CI: 1.1-2.5), CABG (chest only) 2.1%
  (95%CI: 1.0-3.7), vascular 7.1% (95%CI: 4.6-10.3), hip prosthesis 1.3% (95%CI:
  0.5-2.7), knee prosthesis 6.1% (95%CI: 2.8-11.2) and colorectal 12.5% (95%CI:
  9.5-16.1). The development of a bloodstream infection (BSI) associated with a
  central venous catheter (CVC) was not significantly (P=0.6) different when
  examined by duration of exposure with 3.7 BSI per 1000 line-days for CVC in
  situ six or more days compared with 4.0 BSI per 1000 line-days for CVC in situ
  for five or less days. A significantly (P<0.0001) greater proportion of
  patients whose CVC was in situ six or more days (6.8 per 100 patients, 95%CI:
  4.2-10.2) developed a BSI compared with the proportion of patients whose CVC
  was in situ for five or fewer days (0.6 per 100 patients, 95%CI: 0.3-1.3).
  Significantly (P<0.0001) different rates of patients acquiring a new
  methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection were found when hospital
  type was examined with rates ranging from 0.2 to 5.0 per 10 000 occupied acute
  -care bed-days. The pilot highlighted that the collection of data for
  aggregation of some procedures and intravascular catheters may take many years
  before a reliable benchmark can be identified and many hospitals may not
  achieve reliable local rates annually. For surveillance to provide timely
  measures of patient safety we should consider surveillance methods for many
  small to medium sized hospitals that includes active surveillance only for
  infections with concurrent passive surveillance of the relevant denominators.

AB: Background: Current massive transfusion guidelines are derived from washout
  equations that may not apply to bleeding trauma patients. Our aim was to
  analyze these guidelines using a computer simulation. Methods: A combined
  hemodilution and hemodynamic model of an exsanguinating patient was developed
  to calculate the changes in prothrombin time (PT), fibrinogen, and platelets
  with bleeding. The model was calibrated to data from 44 patients. Time
  intervals to subhemostatic values of each coagulation test were calculated for
  a range of replacement options. Results: Prolongation of PT is the sentinel
  event of dilutional coagulopathy and occurs early in the operation. The key to
  preventing coagulopathy is plasma infusion before PT becomes subhemostatic. The
  optimal replacement ratios were 2:3 for plasma and 8:10 for platelets.
  Concurrent transfusion of plasma with blood is another effective strategy for
  minimizing coagulopathy. Conclusion: Existing protocols underestimate the
  dilution of clotting factors in severely bleeding patients. The model presents
  an innovative approach to optimizing component replacement in exsanguinating
  hemorrhage.

AB: Heavy metal pollution is known to be widespread in the sediments of the
  Lagoon of Venice. Therefore, physiological parameters influenced by this form
  of contamination were examined. The bivalve molluscs blue mussel (Mytilus
  galloprovincialis), ark clam (Scapharca inaequivalvis), and Japanese littleneck
  (Tapes philippinarum) were sampled in two sites (Marghera, Chioggia) every 3
  months for 1 year. The digestive gland and gills of each bivalve were analyzed.
  The concentrations of essential and nonessential metals (including chromium,
  manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, and cadmium) were determined.
  Because glutathione and metallothioneins (MTs) are involved in metal
  homeostasis and detoxification, their concentrations were evaluated in relation
  to metal concentrations. Results show that (1) all three studied species
  accumulate metals to a considerable extent, with some species-specific
  differences between the digestive gland and gills; (2) gills are a good tissue
  to evaluate pollution by examining the MT content. In particular, the
  correlation between Zn and MT levels in the gills indicates that M.
  galloprovincialis and S. inaequivalvis are sentinel organisms and can be used
  specifically for Zn pollution; (3) T. philippinarum accumulates Cu in the
  digestive gland more readily than the other two bivalves and therefore has the
  highest MT.

AB: The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)
  recommended that the Standard Threshold Shift (STS) be replaced as the sentinel
  indicator of hearing loss in workplace audiometric surveillance programs. We
  conducted a retrospective cohort study of 1220 workers followed for eight
  consecutive years in the hearing conservation program at the Hanford nuclear
  facility, to evaluate the relative accuracy of eight candidate threshold-shift
  criteria for detecting hearing loss over time, using two evaluation methods and
  comparing to NIOSH findings. The NIOSH-recommended criterion was one of the
  better criteria. However, the differences between better criteria were less
  evident using a different evaluation method than the one described by NIOSH.
  Also, when we compared our findings with those underlying the NIOSH
  recommendation, the between-database differences were large enough that the
  smaller between-criteria differences may have limited importance.

AB: Breast surgery evolves towards always more precise, but less invasive
  techniques. The halstedian concept of radical surgery has been abandoned and
  the majority of patients are now allowed to preserve their breasts provided
  they receive radiation therapy after surgery. In many institutions standard
  axillary lymph-node dissection is being replaced by the less invasive and
  probably also more accurate staging technique known as sentinel-node
  dissection. Nevertheless, the procedure requires interdisciplinary
  collaboration and rigorous quality control monitoring to provide optimal
  results. Many issues, some of which will be discussed in the light of our
  personal experience, still need to be tested in clinical controlled trials.

AB: The knowledge of the status of axillary lymph nodes (LN) of patients with
  breast cancer is a fundamental prerequisite in the therapeutic decision. In the
  present work, we evaluated the impact of fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)
  of ultrasonographically (US) selected axillary LN in the diagnosis of LN
  metastases and subsequently in the treatment of patients with breast cancer.
  Axillary US was performed in 298 patients with diagnosed breast cancer (267
  invasive carcinomas and 31 ductal carcinoma in situ DCIS), and in 95 patients
  it was followed by FNAC of US suspicious LN. Smears were examined by routine
  cytological staining. Cases of uncertain diagnosis were stained in
  immunocytochemistry (ICC) with a combination of anticytokeratin and anti-HMFG2
  antibodies. Eighty-five FNAC were informative (49 LN were positive for
  metastases, 36 were negative). In 49 of 267 patients with invasive breast
  carcinoma (18%), a preoperative diagnosis of metastatic LN in the axilla could
  be confirmed. These patients could proceed directly to axillary dissection. In
  addition, US-guided FNAC presurgically scored 49 out of 88 (55%) metastatic LN.
  Of all others, with nonsuspicious LN on US (203 cases including 31 DCIS), in
  which no FNAC examination was performed, 28 invasive carcinomas (16%) turned
  out to be LN positive on histological examination. Based on these data, US
  examination should be performed in all patients with breast cancer adding ICC
  -supported FNAC only on US-suspect LN. This presurgical protocol is reliable
  for screening patients with LN metastases that should proceed directly to
  axillary dissection or adjuvant chemotherapy, thus avoiding sentinel lymph node
  biopsy.

AB: Epithelial inclusions representing ectopic breast tissue are uncommonly seen
  in axillary lymph nodes. The extensive histopathologic examination of axillary
  sentinel lymph nodes of patients with breast carcinoma may increase the chances
  to encounter tiny foci of ectopic breast tissue, which may be misinterpreted as
  (micro)metastatic disease and lead to unwarranted completion of axillary
  dissection and to inaccurate staging and improper adjuvant treatments for the
  patients. Here we report on seven cases of ectopic breast tissue in axillary
  sentinel lymph nodes. In three cases there were coexistent micrometastases, and
  in the remaining cases the ectopic tissue was not associated with metastatic
  disease. The ectopic breast tissue showed remarkably varied morphologic
  features, including apocrine metaplasia and proliferative changes
  indistinguishable from those occurring in sclerosing adenosis and florid
  epithelial hyperplasia of the breast. A peripheral layer of myoepithelial cells
  was consistently detected in the ectopic glands and ducts. Besides awareness
  and purely morphologic criteria, a false-positive identification of these
  inclusions as metastatic carcinoma may be avoided by the use of
  immunohistochemical reactions for the localization of specific markers of the
  myoepithelial cell component, which is associated with the ectopic breast
  tissue.

AB: Many countries are studying currently the possibility of mass vaccination
  against varicella. The objective of this study was to provide a complete
  picture of the pre-vaccine epidemiology of the Varicella-Zoster Virus in
  England and Wales to aid in the design of immunisation programs. Population
  -based data including general practitioner sentinel surveillance,
  hospitalisation data, and death certificates from England and Wales were
  analysed. The average incidence rates for varicella and zoster between 1991 and
  2000 were 1,291 and 373 per 100,000 years, respectively. Overall
  hospitalisation rates were equal for varicella and zoster (4.5 vs. 4.4
  hospitalisation per 100,000 population) with 5 and 8%, respectively, having
  underlying immunosuppressive conditions. The age-specific proportion of cases
  hospitalised and length of stay were similar between the two diseases. However,
  the overall burden of disease is considerably higher forzoster. The number of
  inpatient days and case-fatality due to zoster are roughly 4 to 6 times greater
  than for varicella (11 vs. 3 days and 25 vs. 4 deaths per 100,000 case). These
  results provide base-line estimates should mass varicella vaccination be
  introduced in England and Wales.

AB: Objectives: Estimates of the HIV/AIDS burden in Burma (Myanmar) are
  uncertain. Using data from the 1999 national HIV sentinel surveillance and
  available population data, we generated estimates of Burma's HIV burden in
  1999. Methodology: The 1999 sentinel surveillance included women attending
  antenatal clinics, male military recruits, blood donors, injecting drug users,
  patients of sexually transmitted disease clinics, and sex workers. We used data
  for women attending antenatal clinics and male recruits aged 20-29 years to
  estimate HIV prevalence among women and men, respectively. Data points were
  merged to give five regional estimates of prevalence for men and women. Census
  figures were used to obtain national population estimates of the numbers of
  Burmese living with HIV infection, along with confidence intervals (CIs).
  Results: HIV prevalence varied by region, with the lowest rates in the West,
  intermediate rates in the central region, and highest rates in the North, East,
  and South. The highest rates were in the East (Shan State), with female
  prevalence of 3.0% (95% CI, 1.9-4.5). The total number of infected women
  nationwide was 218,300 (95% CI, 159,400-277,100), and that of men was 468,700
  (95% CI, 343,300-594,200). We estimated HIV prevalence of at least 3.46% (95%
  CI, 2.72-4.19) among adults aged 15-44 years; 5700 infants were born with HIV
  infection in 1999. Discussion: Burma has a generalized epidemic of HIV-1 in
  reproductive age adults. We estimated that there were 687,000 (95% CI, 541,100
  -832,900) Burmese adults living with HIV infection in 1999, or about one of
  every 29 adult citizens. This estimate is higher than the UNAIDS estimate for
  the same year of 530,000 adults and children living with AIDS, or a population
  prevalence of about one in 50 adults. HIV prevention and care programs are
  urgently needed in Burma.

AB: The purpose of this prospective study of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in
  a large series of melanoma patients with clinically negative regional lymph
  nodes from one cancer centre was to analyse the reliability of the procedure,
  the pattern of failures during follow-up and the factors affecting the clinical
  outcome of patients. Between April 1995 and November 2001, 726 consecutive
  patients with primary cutaneous malignant melanoma underwent SLN biopsy with
  preoperative lymphoscintigraphy. The vital blue dye technique was used in 170
  patients, and the blue dye technique combined with intraoperative
  lymphoscintigraphy in 556 patients. The primary melanoma sites were head and
  neck in nine patients, the extremities in 419 patients, and the trunk in 298
  patients. The median Breslow thickness was 3.0 mm. All patients were followed
  closely, the median follow-up time being 34 months. The sentinel node(s) were
  successfully identified in 96% of patients. Intraoperative lymphoscintigraphy
  combined with the blue dye technique improved the SLN identification rate
  (technical success in 97.3% of cases) compared with the blue dye technique
  alone (technical success in 91.6%). The rate of failed SLN procedures was
  significantly (P = 0.007) lower in inguinal basins (3.1%) compared with
  axillary basins (7.9%). SLN metastases were detected in 147 patients (20.2%).
  The presence of SLN metastases correlated significantly with primary tumour
  thickness and ulceration (P < 0.001). The false-negative SLN biopsy rate was
  4.66% (27 out of 579 SLN-negative patients). All but two node-positive patients
  underwent complete lymphadenectomy. Lymph nodes other than SLNs were found to
  contain metastases in 26.9% of patients (39 out of 145). The 5 year overall
  survival (OS) rate was 84% for SLN-negative patients and 40% for SLN-positive
  patients. Five variables showed a strong, statistically significant negative
  independent prognostic association with OS: positive SLN status (P = 0.000001),
  primary melanoma thickness > 4 mm (P = 0.0009), male gender (P = 0.001), more
  than one lymph node involvement (P = 0.02) and lymph node extracapsular
  extension (P = 0.03). SLN biopsy is currently a valuable and effective
  diagnostic procedure for the precise staging of patients with clinically NO
  cutaneous melanoma. So far SLN biopsy seems to be the only accessible method
  for consciously oriented detection of nodal micrometastases in melanoma that
  would otherwise go undetected. SLN status is the most important factor proven
  to distinguish high and low risk melanoma patients.

AB: BACKGROUND: This report describes the first year of a government-sponsored
  program that uses daily reports from 29 sentinel sites to monitor the capacity
  of the US blood supply to meet demand. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: From August
  15, 2001, to August 14, 2002, 29 sentinel sites provided daily reports of the
  number of units of RBCs in inventory, transfused, exported, and outdated by ABO
  and Rh, and platelets by random or apheresis donor. Days supply of each
  component category was calculated as the number of units in inventory reported
  on a day divided by the sum of units transfused, exported, and outdated on that
  day. Sites also provided daily responses to questions about threatened or
  actual shortages. RESULTS: The median of the days supply of RBCs at the 26
  hospital transfusion services was 7.2 days. However, median days supply varied
  substantially by site and by day of the week. A+, O+, and O- units accounted
  for 30, 35, and 12 percent of total inventory and were maintained at a median
  supply of 7.4, 6.4, and 9.5 days, respectively. Reports of threatened RBC
  shortages peaked in early January 2002 and again in early July 2002. The July
  2002 peak was about twice the January 2002 peak. Inventories at community-based
  centers were similar to those at hospital transfusion services. Hospitals
  maintained only a 1-day supply of platelets. Eight percent of random and 4
  percent of apheresis platelets were outdated. There were 20 reports that
  surgery had to be postponed or canceled because platelets were unavailable.
  CONCLUSIONS: Inventories of RBCs maintained at the participating sites were
  sufficient, with only one brief exception, to meet local demand during the
  first year of this monitoring program. The weekly rate of threatened shortage
  reports was more sensitive than days inventory as a predictor of actual
  shortages of RBCs. Unlike RBCs, platelet days supply, reports of threatened or
  actual platelet shortages, and platelet outdate rates did not vary seasonally.

AB: Several studies in sub-Saharan Africa have reported that HIV prevalence in
  young women is higher than in young men. We used data from Kenya HIV sentinel
  surveillance conducted from 1990 to 2001 among sexually transmitted disease
  (STD) patients (15-49 years old) to investigate consistency of gender
  differentials over time and their risk factors. Of the 15,889 STD patients, the
  HIV prevalence ranged from 16.0% in 1990 to 41.8% in 1997. The odds ratios
  (ORs) of HIV infection for women compared to men decreased by age; women 15-24
  years were nearly twice as likely as men of the same ages to be HIV infected
  (OR 1.7 (1.5-2.0)), but risk in those >44 years was almost equal (OR 0.8 (95%
  CI 0.7-1.2)). The odds of HIV infection for women compared to men were twice in
  unmarried patients (OR 2.1 (95% CI 1.8-2.3)). This association persisted after
  controlling for age groups or marital status, residence, level of education,
  and presence of STD syndromes. This pattern had been consistent over 12 years.
  Adolescent women with symptoms of STDs should be a focus for the HIV/STD
  intervention programmes because of their high risk for HIV.

AB: Objective: To perform sentinel node with local anaesthesia in the breast
  carcinoma without frozen section. So we used definitive histological and
  immunohistochemical results of sentinel node the day of conserving surgery with
  complete axillary lymph node dissection under general anaesthesia in case of
  involved nodes. Methods: Patients with a stage TNM > T1 or N1, a multicentric
  breast cancer, a neoadjuvant chemotherapy, an allergy, an obesity or no
  detection of hot sentinel node were excluded. Patients in ambulatory surgery
  had scintigraphy 3 hours after injection of radiotracer. If we had a hot
  sentinel node, we applied Emla(R) 5% cream on the aveolar and axillary site and
  gave midazolam. We performed an intradermal injection of 2 ml of xylocaine with
  adrenaline above cancer and in the subareolar site in case of non-palpable
  cancer. With the same needle, we injected 2 ml of blue dye. We injected so 2 ml
  of xylocaine with adrenaline in the axillary hot spot. We completed local
  anaesthesia with 16 ml of xylocaine with adrenaline step by step on the route
  that intraoperative gamma probe showed us. Results: We performed 17 patients
  (52.6 years (38-62); body mass index = 23.7 (20-34. 1), size of tumour = 10.8
  mm (1-25)). We detected 100% of sentinel node. We hada second haematoma which
  was evacuated. Conclusion: Perform sentinel node under local anaesthesia is
  possible for patients with no obesity but radio tracer is absolutely necessary.

AB: We examined the reliability of the use of lymphoscintigraphy (LS) and a hand
  -held gamma probe (GP) to identify the sentinel lymph node (SLN), and
  sequentially determined the feasibility of SLN radiolocalization in clinical
  neck node-negative oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients. A radiolabel
  with the unfiltered 99mTc tin colloid was injected submucosally around the
  primary site followed by LS at 2-hour intervals. Preoperative localization was
  performed with GP. After en bloc removal of the regional lymphatics,
  histopathologic results for the nodes were compared with the SLN
  radiolocalization. The LS and GP counts were well correlated, and there was
  concordance between SLN and neck node status in 7 of 8 cases (87.5%). We thus
  considered that our concept in this study was valid in determining the
  necessity for neck dissection for those node-negative oral SCC patients.

AB: Objectives: Pelvic lymph node metastases indicate a poor prognosis for
  patients with clinically localized prostate cancer. The aim of the study was to
  investigate the value of extended histopathological techniques considering the
  extent of pelvic lymphadenectomy and preoperative risk factors. Methods: Total
  of 194 patients with prostate cancer were examined. At first all patients had a
  sampling of the sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) followed in most cases by a modified
  or extended pelvic lymphadenectomy. Step sections, serial sections and
  immunohistochemistry (IHC, pancytokeratin antibody) were analyzed in all SLN
  and so-called non-SLN of the first 100 patients. Later serial sections and IHC
  of non-SLN were left out. Results: In 26.8% lymphatic metastases were found.
  The detection rate of lymph node-positive patients depend significantly on the
  chosen extension of pelvic lymphadenectomy. Limiting the histopathological
  investigation to the lymph node specimen of the obturator fossa only 44.2% of
  lymph node-positive cases would have been identified. An additional inclusion
  of all lymph nodes surrounding the external iliac vessels improves the
  sensitivity to 65.4% (46.7% and 73.3% for the first 100 patients). Compared to
  the extension of pelvic lymphadenectomy the diagnostic gain of serial section
  and IHC (13.8% versus 53.3%) was comparably low. Conclusions: The extension of
  pelvic lymph node dissection is of outstanding value for the identification of
  node-positive patients. Limiting the number of lymph nodes to the ones with the
  highest probability of bearing lymphatic spread (SLN) makes the use of
  extensive histopathological techniques more feasible.

AB: Background: The aim of this study was to determine by radioisotope use
  whether the sentinel lymph node concept is applicable to esophagogastric
  cancers. In addition, we examined radioactivities of hot nodes and compared
  them with the sensitivity of a gamma probe. Methods: The subjects were 44
  patients, 23 with esophageal cancer and 21 with gastric cancer. The day before
  surgery, patients underwent endoscopic submucosal injection of 184 MBq of Tc
  -99m tin colloids into sites surrounding the tumor. Radioisotope activities of
  lymph nodes dissected at surgery were measured with a well-typed gamma detector
  and each lymph node was categorized as a hot or cold node. Histopathology of
  the lymph nodes was examined by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Radioisotope
  activities and histopathological results were compared to determine whether
  radioisotope flow reflects lymphatic flow to regional lymph nodes. The
  sensitivity of a gamma probe was measured in a laboratory study and the
  relation between the radioisotope activities of hot nodes and the detection
  sensitivity of the gamma probe was examined. Results: Histopathological
  examination revealed lymph node metastasis in 18 of the 44 patients. In 15 of
  these 18 patients, metastatic foci were recognized in at least one hot node.
  Subsequent analysis was performed on the 36 patients in whom tumor invasion was
  confined to the muscle layer and in whom endoscopic clippings had not been
  applied. Lymph node metastases were observed in 12 of these 36 patients. In
  these 12 patients, at least one hot node was positive for metastasis. The
  laboratory study revealed that the gamma probe was able to detect radioisotope
  activities of gtoreq0.02 muCi. Thirty-two of 63 (51%) esophageal cancer hot
  nodes and 16 of 86 (19%) gastric cancer hot nodes showed radioisotope
  activities below the detection sensitivity of the gamma probe. Conclusion: The
  sentinel lymph node concept is applicable to patients with esophageal and
  gastric cancers; however, further studies are necessary to identify hot nodes
  accurately using gamma probes.

AB: Recent studies revealed that intestinal acanthocephalans of fish can
  accumulate heavy metals to concentrations orders of magnitude higher than those
  in the host tissues or the aquatic environment. This significant heavy metal
  accumulation by acanthocephalans, even surpassing that of established free
  living accumulation bioindicators, encouraged us to study the bioavailability
  of the platinum-group-metals (PGM) Pt and Rh for parasites. These precious
  metals are used in catalytic converters of cars for exhaust gas purification in
  Europe since the early 1980s. In addition to the beneficial effect in reducing
  the emission of CHx, CO and NOx of cars there is an increasing emission of
  these metals. However, it still remains unclear if these elements become
  accumulated in the biosphere and whether they affect the health of organisms.
  The present study reveals that in European eels (Anguilla anguilla) naturally
  infected with the eoacanthocephalan parasite Paratenuisentis ambiguus and
  experimentally exposed to ground catalytic converter material, the parasites
  take up and accumulate the catalytic active metals Pt and Rh whereas in the
  examined host tissues we found no metal uptake. Compared with the PGM
  concentrations in the water the worms contained 1600 times higher Rh and 50
  times higher Pt concentrations. Thus, the parasites can be used as sentinel
  organisms reflecting even very low levels of precious metals.

LA: English
AB: Background: The relapsing form of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is
  characterized by recurrent optic neuritis and myelitis, usually leading to
  severe, permanent, relapse-related neurologic impairment (e.g., blindness,
  paraplegia) within 5 years. Aggressive therapy aimed at relapse prevention
  initiated soon after disease onset may be expected to have a relatively greater
  impact on early relapse-related disability in NMO than in typical MS. Early
  prediction of a relapsing course and subsequent disease severity would
  facilitate design and implementation of clinical trials of such therapies.
  Methods: A database of clinical and laboratory features of patients with NMO (n
  = 80) was used to develop potentially useful models predictive of a relapsing
  disease course and of subsequent disease severity as measured by survival.
  Results: Predictors of a relapsing course were longer interattack interval
  between the first two clinical events (rate ratio (RR) = 2.16; per month
  increase), older age at onset (RR = 1.08; per year increase), female sex (RR =
  10.0, female vs male), and less severe motor impairment with the sentinel
  myelitis event (RR = 0.48; per severity scale point increase). A history of
  other autoimmune disease (RR = 4.15; presence vs absence), higher attack
  frequency during the first 2 years of disease (RR = 1.21; per attack), and
  better motor recovery following the index myelitis event (RR = 1.84; per point
  increase) were associated with mortality due to relapsing NMO. Conclusions:
  These predictive models identify several clinical features, each available at
  diagnosis or early in the disease course, that predict relapsing disease and
  survival. These results may be useful to identify patients at high risk for
  severe, relapsing neuromyelitis optica in order to initiate early therapy for
  relapse prevention and to design clinical trials to study such interventions.

AB: We determined the composition and organization of avian mixed-species
  foraging flocks during the non-breeding season from April to August 2000 in a
  high-Andean forest fragment of Polylepis besseri (Rosaceae) (3710-3880 m
  a.s.l., 11 ha) in Cochabamba, Bolivia. Forest birds were color-banded monthly
  starting December 1999. Sixty-three observations of flocks were made containing
  a total of 10 species with a mean (+- SD) of 2.8 +- 0.9 species and 5.4 +- 1.8
  individuals per flock. The entire Polylepis bird community contained 30 core
  species. Since the forest was small, most flocks contained at least some of the
  same individuals. Three species occurred in > 70% (Giant Conebill Oreomanes
  fraseri Tawny Tit-Spine-tail Leptasthenura yanacensis, and White-throated
  Tyrannulet Mecocerculus leucophrys, with 2.6 +- 0.6, 1.9 +- 0.6, and 1.6 +- 0.5
  individuals per flock respectively), one species (Asthenes dorbignyi with 1.4 +
  - 0.5 individuals per flock) in 21%, and the remaining six species in pnd 5% of
  all flocks. All flock participants except one were insectivores. Individuals of
  O. fraseri showed high intraspecific group or pair fidelity and often, but not
  always, acted as flock leader, whereas the sentinel role was mainly assumed by
  L. yanacensis or A. dorbignyi. For the three species regularly associated with
  mixed-species flocks, home ranges of banded individuals observed in flocks were
  determined. Mean home ranges (100% minimum convex polygons) were 6.13 +- 0.87
  ha for O. fraseri (n = 4), 2.13 +- 1.26 ha for L. yanacensis (n = 6), and 3.41
  +- 2.73 ha for M. leucophrys (n = 3). Intraspecific home range overlap was
  moderate to high in all species, clear associations of Tawny Tit-Spinetail and
  White-throated Tyrannulet individuals with one of the two Giant Conebill
  pairs/groups were lacking, and agonistic interactions were almost absent except
  in August. In other words, neither individuals nor flocks were territorial, and
  flocks were much more loosely structured than those studied in Neotropical
  lowlands, resembling in some respects mixed-species flocks in northern
  temperate zones. Selective advantages of mixed flocks in Polylepis forests are
  briefly discussed, finding support only for the predation avoidance hypothesis.

AB: The sensitivity and specificity of detecting metastatic breast carcinoma in
  sentinel lymph nodes using a rapid immunohistochemistry technique was
  determined and compared with methods currently used at the authors'
  institution. At the time of intraoperative consultation, after routine
  diagnostic touch preparations and frozen sections were prepared, 6-mum frozen
  sections of 72 sentinel lymph nodes from 32 patients with breast carcinoma were
  placed on plus slides, fixed in cold acetone for 2 or 3 minutes, and stored at 
  -70degreeC. These sections were immunostained with a prediluted broad-spectrum
  anticytokeratin monoclonal antibody coupled to an inert polymer with
  horseradish peroxidase (DAKO EPOS). Slides were ready for interpretation within
  16 minutes and were scored as positive, negative, or equivocal for metastatic
  carcinoma. Results were compared with those of the intraoperative touch
  preparations and frozen sections and with paraffin-embedded, hematoxylin and
  eosin-stained, and AE1/AE3 immunostained permanent sections. Fourteen (19%)
  sentinel lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma in 13 patients. All
  methods tested were 100% specific. The rapid immunohistochemistry method was
  the least sensitive (57% sensitivity) of all methods used to detect metastasis.
  Routine diagnostic touch preparations, frozen sections, and permanent sections
  had sensitivities of 69%, 86%, and 100% respectively. In conclusion, this rapid
  immunohistochemistry method would not be helpful in intraoperative assessment
  of sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer patients due to its low sensitivity.

AB: Data from a recent study support the hypothesis that axillary lymph node
  metastases frequently localize near the inflow junction of the afferent
  lymphatic vessel. Our goal was to evaluate the microscopic location of axillary
  sentinel lymph node metastases in a prospective study of breast cancer
  patients. A total of 305 axillary sentinel lymph nodes from 213 breast cancer
  patients undergoing surgery at our institution were evaluated. Preoperative
  lymphoscintigraphy using technetium-labeled sulfur colloid and intraoperative
  isosulfan blue dye injection were used for identifying the sentinel lymph node.
  Intraoperatively, the surgeon placed a suture either at the point of entry of
  isosulfan blue dye or at the area with the highest radioactive counts, and this
  area was inked at the grossing bench before processing. Metastases were
  identified in 55 of the 305 lymph nodes examined. Thirty-four nodes contained
  metastases in both the inked half and the opposite half. Metastatic tumor was
  identified in the inked half alone in 18 lymph nodes. Only three nodes
  contained metastatic tumor in the opposite half with no tumor in the inked half
  (p <0.001). Similar results were found when nodes tagged at the point of blue
  dye entry and nodes tagged at the area with the highest radioactive counts were
  analyzed separately. Our findings suggest that metastatic tumor has a higher
  probability of being present in the region of the inflow junction of the
  afferent lymphatic vessel. This information may be useful in determining the
  optimal method for evaluating axillary sentinel lymph node specimens from
  breast cancer patients.

AB: Muscle concentrations of organochlorinated compounds as well as biliary
  levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) metabolites were determined in
  red mullet Mullus barbatus as a sentinel species for assessing the pollution
  along the western Mediterranean coast. A battery of biochemical markers
  -biotransformation and antioxidant enzymes-were also measured in liver
  subcellular fractions to assess exposure to pollutants. Among them, 7
  -ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity, as well as 7-penthoxyresorufin O
  -deethylase (PROD) activity and cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) content evidenced
  strong differences among sampling sites, and a good correlation with the amount
  of PCBs bioaccumulated by fish. No clear pollution-related response was
  observed for cytosolic glutathione S-transferase, whereas uridine-diphosphate
  UDP-glucuronyltransferase (UDPGT) was elevated in fish from polluted sites.
  Antioxidant enzymes-superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and glutathione
  peroxidase (GPX)-were used to assess oxidative stress. Among them, catalase
  activity was well related to PCB body burden.

AB: Background: Accurate localization of the breast sentinel lymph node (SLN)
  can be challenging as a minimally invasive approach to the treatment of early
  -stage breast cancer. We tested the potential capability of interstitial
  computed tomographic lymphography (CT-LG) using a conventional contrast agent
  (iopamidol) for SLN mapping. Methods: In 14 female dogs, 0.5 and 1 mL of
  undiluted iopamidol was injected subcutaneously into the 2 skin areas overlying
  the mammary gland. Contiguous, 2 mm-thick multidetector helical CT images were
  obtained through the upper breast and axilla before, and for 60 minutes after,
  gentle massage at the injection site. Three-dimensional (3D) CT images were
  obtained from the postcontrast images showing the greatest SLN enhancement.
  This CT-LG with 2 mL of iopamidol was also evaluated in 5 human female
  volunteer. Results: The direct connection of SLN and lymphatic vessels draining
  from the injection sites in the animal models was clearly visualized, even with
  0. 5 mL of iopamidol. With this dose, the SLN attenuation was maximally
  enhanced, with a mean of 274 Hounsfield units (HU) on the first postcontrast
  images. The topographic 3D images provided the comprehensive anatomy of these
  lymphatic pathways. Of the 28 SLNs and 184 distant nodes visualized on CT
  images, all of the SLNs (100%) and 161 (87.5%) of the distant nodes could be
  resected at premortem and/or postmortem, with a good correlation in the
  locations and sizes with those on the CT images. The CT-LG effectively
  localized 5 SLNs with averaged maximum attenuation of 223 HU in the human
  volunteers, without any significant adverse effects. Conclusion: Interstitial
  CT-LG using small volumes of iopamidol can sufficiently visualize breast
  lymphatic drainage and may have potential utility for breast SLN mapping.

AB: Routine testing of bedding sentinels from a barrier room revealed one mouse
  seropositive to ectromelia virus (EV). Results of hemagglutination-inhibition
  testing and western blot analysis were confirmatory for orthopoxvirus
  antibodies. Additional seropositive animals were not identified. Interviews
  indicated that replication-competent vaccinia virus (VV), Western Reserve
  strain (VV-WR), recently had been given to mice. Although VV-WR was not
  expected to spread by contact or via fomites, the case evidence suggested
  transmission of vaccinia via soiled bedding. In a follow-up experiment, 15
  index mice were inoculated with 107 plaque-forming units of VV by either
  subcutaneous or intrarectal instillation. A dedicated contact sentinel and a
  bedding sentinel were provided for each index mouse. All 15 index mice were
  positive for antibodies when tested 22 days after inoculation. One mouse,
  inoculated by the subcutaneous route, appeared ill and developed lesions on the
  proximal portion of the tail. The contact sentinel mouse housed with this index
  mouse was the only sentinel to seroconvert. We conclude that VV-WR can spread
  to contact sentinels and potentially to bedding sentinels. The ability of other
  VV strains to be transmitted horizontally and the susceptibility of different
  mouse strains to infection merit further investigation. The use of W in animal
  facilities must be managed carefully since the available serologic tests do not
  distinguish between VV and EV, an exotic agent of major concern to laboratory
  animal facilities.

AB: The surveillance of pneumococcal antibiotic resistance and serotype
  distribution is hampered by the relatively low numbers of invasive pneumococcal
  infections. In Switzerland, a nationwide sentinel surveillance network was used
  to assess antibiotic resistance and serotype distribution among 1179
  pneumococcal isolates cultured from 2769 nasopharyngeal swabs obtained from
  outpatients with acute otitis media or pneumonia during 1998 and 1999. The
  proportion of penicillin-susceptible pneumococcal isolates overall (87%) and
  among infants <2 years old (81%) was comparable to that of invasive isolates
  (90% and 81%, respectively). The high number of nasopharyngeal isolates allowed
  for the detection of a rapid increase in the number of penicillin
  -nonsusceptible pneumococcal (PNSP) strains in the West region of Switzerland,
  partly because of an epidemic caused by the 19F clone of Streptococcus
  pneumoniae. Clustering of risk factors for the carriage of PNSP isolates
  further explained the geographic variation in resistance rates. The nationwide
  sentinel surveillance of nasopharyngeal pneumococcus proved to be valuable for
  the monitoring of antibiotic resistance, risk factors for carriage of PNSP
  isolates, and serotype distribution and for the detection of the emergence of a
  new epidemic clone.

AB: The egg parasitoid Trichogramma brassicae Bezdenko was introduced from
  Moldavia to western Europe some 30 years ago and since then has been
  inundatively released to control the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis
  Hubner, in maize. We investigated parasitism of non-target butterfly eggs by T.
  brassicae in field cages and under field conditions in Switzerland. Parasitism
  of eggs (exposed for 24 h) of six non-target species (Papilio machaon L.,
  Clossiana selene Denis and Schiffermuller, Maniola jurtina L., Melanargia
  galathea L., Hipparchia alcyone Denis and Schiffermuller, Cyaniris semiargus
  Rottemburg) in field cages of 2X2X2 m ranged between 2.5 and 18.7% when based
  on a relative high number of released parasitoid females (780+-273 SD/cage).
  This number is 16-fold more compared to agricultural practices (120,000/ha). As
  a control, Ephestia kuehniella Zeller eggs were glued on the same plant. A
  difference in parasitism rates between the non-target species and E. kuehniella
  was only observed for M. galathea. During inundative releases of T. brassicae
  in maize, sentinel eggs of two suitable non-target hosts and of E. kuehniella
  were exposed for 72 h. Parasitism rates of E. kuehniella egg masses inside
  maize fields averaged 40% compared to significantly lower parasitism rates of
  26.2 and 12.6% for eggs of H. alcyone and M. galathea. At 2 m distance from the
  maize field, parasitism rates decreased to 2.3% for M. galathea, 6.1% for H.
  alcyone, and 9.8% for E. kuehniella while no single egg was found parasitized
  at 20 m distance from the release fields. We conclude that, although the tested
  non-target butterflies were all attacked under semi-field and field conditions,
  effects on non-target butterflies due to mass released T. brassicae are minimal.

AB: Recognition of stereotypic chemical patterns by sentinel cells of the innate
  immune system provokes a transient deviation from homeostasis, the acute-phase
  response (APR). Although APR effectors have been identified individually, the
  complexity of the response suggested that emergent properties would be
  uncovered by a more comprehensive examination. Our global assessment revealed
  that apprxeq7% of genes in the mouse are mobilized in the hepatic APR to
  endotoxin. Extensive metabolic adjustments include suppression of pathways for
  cholesterol, fatty acid, and phospholipid synthesis. Increased expression of
  genes for innate defense was accompanied by coordinate induction of the MHC
  class I antigen presentation machinery, illustrating an intersection between
  innate and adaptive immunity.

AB: Purpose: To review the literature, contributing factors, prevention
  recommendations, and medical legal data regarding wrong-site eye surgery.
  Methods: We preformed a computer literature search assessing the published
  ophthalmic literature pertaining to wrong-site eye surgery. We reviewed medical
  and nursing society internet web sites and journals for materials and
  recommendations for prevention of wrong-site surgery. We obtained malpractice
  and liability data through personal communication with physican insurer
  consultants, and with the review of physician insurer and professional
  liability internet web sites. Results: To the best of our knowledge, wrong-site
  eye surgery has not been discussed in the published ophthalmic literature since
  1947. Between 1995-2001, 10.4% of 1294 sentinel events reviewed by the Joint
  Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations were wrong site
  surgeries. The worlds largest malpractice database indicates 928 closed claims
  from wrong-site surgery from 1985-1997. Nineteen of these 928 claims occured in
  ophthalmology. Seventy-nine percent of wrong-site ophthalmology claims resulted
  in an indemnity payment, whereas 70-77% of overall closed ophthalmology claims
  result in no payment. Orthopedic surgery is the discipline with the highest
  number of wrong site surgery malpractice claims. Accordingly, the American
  Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons created a campaign to increase awareness of
  prevention strategies. The American Academy of Ophthalmology internet web site
  has recently posted their first patient safety bulletin, entitled, "Eliminating
  Wrong Site Surgery". We will discuss the currently accepted contributing
  factors and prevention strategies suggested by these societies. Conclusion:
  Wrong-site eye surgery is rarely discussed in the ophthalmic literature.
  Implications of wrong-site eye surgery include high likelihood of indemnity
  payment, as well as deleterious effects to a patient's health and vision. These
  events can be avoided by implementation of prevention strategies in all
  surgical facilities.

AB: The determination of field inactivation rates of oocysts in sludge and soil
  is important as many land applications use sludge as a means of fertilizing the
  soil. Approximately 2.5X105 oocysts were spiked into separate sentinel chambers
  containing a 1.0 g mixture of sludge and soil. The sentinel chambers were
  exposed to the soil surface environment for 60 days at a depth of 10 cm in
  order to evaluate the field inactivation rates of oocysts. The mass balance
  approach was used to determine the number of oocysts lost in the experiments.
  The results of the study showed that oocysts could survive environmental stress
  in soil. The mean inactivation rate of oocysts in the sentinel chambers at time
  intervals of 0 to 17 days, 17 to 30 days, 30 to 45 days, and 45 to 60 days were
  0.0045, 0.0033, 0.0043, and 0.012 day-1, respectively. Whereas, the mean
  inactivation rates of oocysts in control units at time intervals of 0 to 17
  days, 17 to 30 days, 30 to 45 days, and 45 to 60 days were 0.0023, 0.0019,
  0.0017, and 0.0025 day-1, respectively. An average of 4.8 percent of oocysts
  were lost in the experiments. Overall, the study demonstrated the presence of
  viable oocysts in sludge samples, which could potentially be used to fertilize
  agricultural land.

AB: We performed experimental infection in 10-week-old pigs with the Paderborn
  isolate of classical swine fever virus (CSFV). Despite being epidemiologically
  linked to the major CSFV outbreak in The Netherlands in 1997, the in vivo
  replication kinetics of this isolate have to our knowledge not been described
  in detail previously. We found that oronasal infection with 104.7 TCID50
  produced mortality in three out of five pigs after 29-31 days, and severe
  clinical symptoms in one out of five pigs, while one out of five pigs exhibited
  no clinical symptoms. At this infection dose, pigs had viral RNA (monitored by
  quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR) in serum as soon as 2 days post
  -infection, and excretion of infectious virus (monitored by sentinel pigs)
  appeared to be virtually concomitant with viremia onset. While virus RNA was
  cleared from the serum of most pigs after 1-2 weeks, some pigs had viral RNA in
  serum for more than 30 days, and exhibited only mild clinical symptoms. We
  observed an excellent correlation between clinical symptoms and viral RNA loads
  in serum, while serum antibody levels were low. Clinically affected pigs had up
  to 1000-fold higher serum viral RNA loads than did pigs without clinical
  symptoms. At this level of infection, and this age group, the Paderborn isolate
  exhibited a strikingly wide range of replication patterns, which might be
  relevant to the spread of the virus through susceptible pig populations, and
  the severity of the 1997-1998 outbreak.

AB: Minimally invasive radio-guided surgery (MIRS) of parathyroid adenomas has
  been favoured by three main factors. One is the significant improvements
  achieved in preoperative localizing imaging, particularly with sestamibi
  scintigraphy. Another is the availability of intra-operative quick parathyroid
  hormone measurement, and finally the increase in availability of the intra
  -operative gamma probes in many surgical centres especially those performing
  sentinel node biopsy. In contrast with the traditional wide bilateral neck
  exploration (BNE), MIRS requires strict inclusion criteria: 1) high probability
  of a solitary parathyroid adenoma, 2) a significant sestamibi uptake in the
  parathyroid adenoma, 3) absence of a concomitant thyroid nodular disease, 4) no
  family history of familial hyperparathyroidism (HPT) of multiple endocrine
  neoplasia, 5) no previous neck irradiation. Following these criteria about 60
  -70% of all primary HPT patients are suitable for a MIRS. Two main protocols
  for MIRS have been proposed. The single day, imaging and surgery, protocol is
  based on the injection of a 740 MBq dose of 99mTc sestamibi with the purpose of
  obtaining scintigraphic imaging and then MIRS within 3 hours from radio-tracer
  injection. An alternative is for imaging to be performed a few days before
  surgery, with a further small administered activity of 37MBq of 99mTc sestamibi
  injected intravenously in the operating theatre a few minutes before commencing
  the intervention for the purpose of MIRS only. The latter protocol allows both
  better planning of operating theatre scheduling and reduction of the radiation
  exposure to the surgical staff. The main advantages of MIRS in respect to the
  traditional BNE include less surgical trauma, a shorter duration of anaesthesia
  and surgery, a shorter hospital stay with the possibility of same-day
  discharge, less postsurgical pain with improved cosmetic results and lower
  costs. Moreover, MIRS has proven to be a safe technique with a low morbidity
  rate and a cure rate higher than 95% in patients with primary HPT.

AB: Biochemical measurements in the sentinel clam Chamaelea gallina have been
  used as biomarkers of marine pollution. In this study, S9, cytosolic fractions
  (CF), and microsomal fractions (MF) prepared from unexposed clams and clams
  exposed to model pollutants were used to activate 2-aminoanthracene (2-AA) and
  2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF) to mutagens in Salmonella typhimurium strain BA149,
  which overexpresses O-acetyltransferase. Arylamine activation was similar with
  subcellular fractions from unexposed and Aroclor 1254-exposed clams, but
  decreased with fractions from As(III)- and Cu(II)-exposed clams. Bioactivation
  of arylamines by CF was higher than by MF, and higher with NADH than with NADPH
  as the reducing agent. alpha-Naphthoflavone inhibited AAF activation by CF and
  MF, but increased 2-AA activation nearly twofold. In contrast to the results
  with arylamine activation, benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylase (BPH) activity increased
  twofold in fractions from Aroclor 1254- and Cu(II)-exposed clams. Activation of
  2-AA was also evaluated using S9 fractions from clams sampled at littoral sites
  with different pollutant levels. Compared to a reference site, lower 2-AA
  bioactivation and higher BPH activity were found in clams containing high
  levels of copper and organic contaminants, although the differences were not
  statistically significant. While these findings agree with the results of the
  model Cu(II) exposure, the effects of other pollutants cannot be ruled out. The
  results of the study demonstrate that arylamine activation by clams is not
  preferentially catalyzed by microsomal monooxygenases but by unknown cytosolic
  system(s), and that bioactivation of 2-AA and AAF appears to occur by different
  pathways.

AB: Epizootic avian vacuolar myelinopathy (AVM) was first recognized as a
  neurologic disease in bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and American coots
  (Fulica americana) in Arkansas, USA in 1994 and 1996, respectively, but
  attempts to identify the etiology of the disease have been unsuccessful to
  date. Between 1998 and 2001, wing clipped sentinel birds (wild American coots
  and game farm mallards (Anas platyrhynchos)) were released at Lake Surf, North
  Carolina, a lake with recurrent outbreaks of AVM, in order to gain a better
  understanding of the epizootiology of the disease. As early as 5-7 days post
  -release, sentinel coots and mallards showed neurologic signs of disease and
  were confirmed with AVM upon histologic examination of their brains. Serial
  releases of sentinel mallards during the summer, fall, and winter of 2000-01
  demonstrated that exposure to the causative agent at a threshold sufficient to
  manifest disease was seasonal and occurred over about a 2 mo period, during
  November and December. Our findings that disease onset can be very rapid (5-7
  days) and that exposure to the causative agent of AVM is site-specific,
  seasonal (late fall to early winter), and occurs over a relatively short
  duration (several months) supports the hypothesis that the disease is caused by
  a chemical substance, most likely of natural origin.

AB: Identifying the presence of bovine tuberculosis (TB; Mycobacterium bovis) in
  wildlife is crucial in guiding management aimed at eradicating the disease from
  New Zealand. Unfortunately, surveys of the principal wildlife host, the
  introduced brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), require large samples
  (>95% of the population) before they can provide reasonable confidence that the
  disease is absent. In this study, we tested the feasibility of using a more
  wide-ranging species, feral pig (Sus scrofa), as an alternative sentinel
  capable of indicating TB presence. In January 2000, 17 pigs in four groups were
  released into a forested area with a low density of possums in which TB was
  known to be present. The pigs were radiotracked at 2 wk intervals from February
  to October 2000, and some of them were killed and necropsied at various
  intervals after release. Of the 15 pigs successfully recovered and necropsied,
  one killed 2 mo after release had no gross lesions typical of TB, and the only
  other pig killed at that time had greatly enlarged mandibular lymph nodes. The
  remainder were killed at longer intervals after release and all had gross
  lesions typical of TB. Mycobacterium bovis was isolated from all 15 pigs by
  mycobacterial culture. Home range sizes of pigs varied widely and increased
  with the length of time the pigs were in the forest, with minimum convex
  polygon range-size estimates averaging 10.7 km2 (range 4.7-20.3 km2) for the
  pigs killed after 6 mo. A 6 km radius around the kill site of each pig would
  have encompassed 95% of all of their previous locations at which they could
  have become infected. However, one pig shifted 35 km, highlighting the main
  limitation of using unmarked feral pigs as sentinels. This trial indicates use
  of resident and/or released free-ranging pigs is a feasible alternative to
  direct prevalence surveys of possums for detecting TB presence.

AB: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is rapidly emerging as an alternative to
  axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for many female breast cancer patients.
  In contrast, ALND remains the standard of care for male breast cancer patients
  with similar tumors. We evaluated the results of SLN biopsy in male breast
  cancer patients with clinically negative axillae. This study included all male
  breast cancer patients who underwent SLN biopsy at our institution between
  October 1999 and 2000. All patients had negative axillae on clinical
  examination and sonography. All patients underwent preoperative
  lymphoscintigraphy followed by SLN biopsy performed using a combination of
  isosulfan blue dye and technetium Tc 99m sulfur colloid. Tc 99m sulfur colloid
  was injected at a dose of 2.5 mCi 24 h before surgery (four patients) or 0.5
  mCi 2-4h before surgery (three patients). Intraoperatively, 5 ml of 1%
  isosulfan blue was injected adjacent to the breast tumor or biopsy cavity prior
  to SLN biopsy. A gamma probe was used intraoperatively in order to localize
  SLNs. Any node that was blue or associated with ex vivo radioactivity counts at
  least 10 times higher than the axillary background counts was defined as a SLN.
  SLNs were assessed intraoperatively using touch preparation cytologic
  examination. Completion ALND was performed if nodal metastases were identified.
  Seven patients, 44-76 years of age, were included in the study. Preoperative
  lymphoscintigraphy identified SLNs in five patients. Intraoperatively, SLNs
  were identified in all seven patients. SLNs were identified in six patients
  using the gamma probe and in all seven patients using blue dye. The mean number
  of SLNs encountered was 2.9. Findings on touch preparation cytology correlated
  with findings on the final pathological analysis examination in all patients.
  One patient had a positive SLN, this patient had three additional positive
  nodes identified in his completion ALND specimen. Three patients with negative
  SLNs had been elected preoperatively to undergo ALND regardless of findings on
  SLN biopsy, no positive lymph nodes were identified in the ALND specimens from
  these patients. These findings compare favorably with findings reported in the
  literature regarding SLN biopsy in female breast cancer patients. Blue dye
  injection and radioisotope injection were complementary. SLN biopsy should be
  considered for axillary staging in male breast cancer patients with clinically
  negative axillae.

AB: To date, there are no reliable criteria to identify those patients with
  melanoma-infiltrated sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) of the groin who might benefit
  from an extended lymphadenectomy, including the pelvic lymph nodes. We
  hypothesised that there are pelvic lymph nodes that receive lymph directly from
  the primary tumour, thus being at an increased risk for metastasis. In order to
  determine the frequency of radioactively labelled pelvic lymph nodes and the
  kinetics of their appearance, we introduce here a combination of dynamic
  lymphoscintigraphy, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and
  image fusion of SPECT and pelvic Computed Tomography (CT)-scans. By dynamic
  lymphoscintigraphy and intraoperative gamma probe detection, superficially
  located inguinal SLNs (median 2 nodes) could be identified in all of the 51
  patients included in this analysis. The histological search for micrometastases
  was positive in 16 patients (median Breslow thickness of the primary melanoma
  2.5 mm). In 29 patients, SPECT and the image fusion technique were additionally
  performed. Radioactively labelled pelvic lymph nodes were detected in 20
  individuals, 6 of them presenting aberrant pelvic SLNs that, on dynamic
  lymphoscintigraphy, had appeared simultaneously with the superficial SLN(s). Of
  the 6 patients in whom radioactive pelvic lymph nodes were excised together
  with the superficial SLN(s), only one had positive superficial SLNs. In this
  patient, the aberrant pelvic SLN proved to be tumour-positive. In 9 patients,
  there was no radiotracer uptake in the pelvic lymph nodes at all. Image fusion
  of SPECT and pelvic CT-scans is an excellent tool to localise exactly the
  pelvic tumour-draining nodes. The significance of radioactively labelled pelvic
  lymph nodes for the probability of pelvic metastases should be analysed further.

AB: Currently, axillary lymph node dissection is increasingly being replaced by
  the sentinel node procedure. This method is time-consuming and the full
  immunohistochemical evaluation is usually only first known postoperatively.
  This study was designed to evaluate the accuracy of preoperative ultrasound
  -guided fine needle aspirations (FNAs) for the detection of non-palpable lymph
  node metastases in primary breast cancer patients. We evaluated the material of
  183 ultrasound-guided FNAs of non-palpable axillary lymph nodes of primary
  breast cancer patients. The cytological results were compared with the final
  histological diagnosis. Ultrasound-guided FNA detected metastases in 44%
  (37/85) of histologically node-positive patients, in 20% of the total patient
  population studied. These pecentages are likely to be higher when women with
  palpable nodes are included. Cytologically false-negative and false-positive
  nodes were seen in 28 (15%) and three cases (1.6%), respectively. Interestingly
  25% (n=7) of the false-negative nodes, revealed micrometastases on
  postoperative histology. The sensitivity was 57%, the specificity 96%. We
  conclude that ultrasound-guided FNA of the axillary lymph nodes is an effective
  procedure that should be included in the preoperative staging of all primary
  breast cancer patients. Whether lymph nodes are palpable or not, it will save
  considerable operating time by selecting those who need a complete axillary
  lymph node dissection at primary surgery and would save a significant number of
  sentinel lymph node dissections (SLNDs).

AB: Patients identified as having symptomatic HIV infection or AIDS have been
  reported to the Division of Epidemiology (DOE), in the Thai Ministry of Public
  Health (MOPH) since 1984. In addition, since 1989, the DOE and the Royal Thai
  Army have conducted annual serosurveillance of HIV in particular populations.
  Sexual behavior surveys have been conducted annually since 1995. HIV prevalence
  among direct commercial sex workers (CSWs) peaked in 1994 (33%) but has
  declined to 22%. Prevalence among male CSWs reached 18% in 1994 but has not
  changed since. HIV prevalence among blood donors was 1% in 1992, but has
  declined to 0.5%. HIV prevalence among pregnant women peaked in 1995 (2.3%) and
  has since declined to 1.5%. HIV prevalence among 21-year-old male conscripts
  peaked in 1993 (4%), but declined to 1.9% in 1998. Prevalence among IDUs has
  remained between 30%-40% since the late 1980's. The number of reported AIDS
  cases was 128,606 by October of 1999, and has increased yearly. Nonetheless
  this figure is likely unreliable due to significant underreporting. Thailand's
  surveillance program appears to be effective in increasing public knowledge and
  information about the epidemic, although it faces growing problems of good data
  management, interpretation, timely distribution of information, and
  investigation of abnormal events.

AB: In Germany, since 1982, information on AIDS cases has been collected at the
  AIDS Center of the Robert Koch Institute. Since 1987, all laboratories
  performing HIV confirmatory testing have been required to report positive
  results anonymously. AIDS incidence peaked at about 2000 cases per year in 1993
  and began to decline in 1995 following the widespread use of highly effective
  antiretroviral treatment. Current data indicate that the AIDS incidence has
  stabilized at a level of 750 cases per year since 1998. The number of newly
  diagnosed HIV infections has remained fairly stable at approximately 2000 to
  2500 per year since 1993. Unlinked anonymous testing of dried blood spots from
  newborns is carried out in two federal states. The average prevalence of HIV
  seropositivity from 1993 to 1997 among women bearing children was 0.57 per 1000
  in Berlin and 0.14 per 1000 in Lower Saxony.

AB: This article describes the methods, results and future perspectives of four
  information sources used to monitor the HIV epidemic in Canada: AIDS case
  surveillance, HIV case surveillance, HIV sentinel serosurveillance, and
  behavioral surveillance. Synthesizing data from these multiple sources provides
  a more comprehensive picture of the HIV epidemic than any one source alone
  could provide. In Canada, there has been a shift over time from an epidemic
  dominated by men who have sex with men to one where more than half of new
  infections are attributed to other groups, such as injection drug users and non
  -injecting heterosexuals. The available evidence also suggests increasing HIV
  infections among Aboriginal persons and among women. Surveillance data have
  been used in Canada to guide prevention and care programs and to formulate
  policy. In particular, these data have been used to support the development of
  an HIV testing program in pregnancy, to re-direct community work toward
  injection drug users and the young, and to demonstrate the effectiveness of new
  treatments for HIV. The main challenge now is to continue to improve the
  monitoring of the shifting HIV epidemic with more accurate data and to use the
  resulting information to inform appropriate prevention and care responses.

AB: Study objective: To describe the development of the public health
  surveillance system for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games; document its major
  findings; and discuss the implications for public health surveillance for
  future events. Design: Planning for the system took almost three years. Its
  major components included increased surveillance of communicable diseases;
  presentations to sentinel emergency departments; medical encounters at Olympic
  venues; cruise ship surveillance; environmental and food safety inspections;
  surveillance for bioterrorism; and global epidemic intelligence. A daily report
  integrated data from all sources. Setting: Sydney, Australia. Surveillance
  spanned the period 28 August to 4 October 2000. Participants: Residents of
  Sydney, athletes and officials, Australian and international visitors. Main
  results: No outbreaks of communicable diseases were detected. There were around
  5% more presentations to Sydney emergency departments than in comparable
  periods in other years. Several incidents detected through surveillance,
  including injuries caused by broken glass, and a cluster of presentations
  related to the use of the drug ecstasy, prompted further action. Conclusions:
  Key elements in the success of public health surveillance for the Games
  included its careful planning, its comprehensive coverage of public health
  issues, and its timely reporting and communication processes. Future systems
  need to be flexible enough to detect the unexpected.

AB: Influenza-like-illness (ILI) is monitored in France by Inserm through a
  computerised network of sentinel GPs. Between November 1984 and July 2002,
  about 270 000 cases of ILI have been individually reported and described
  according to a standard operating procedure and a unique case definition. This
  database is available on the Internet without any access restriction
  (http://www.u444.jussieu.fr/sentiweb). From these data, epidemiologic research
  was first oriented to manage large continuous fluxes of information and then
  for a better understanding of epidemic dynamics. Research is currently focused
  on early warning and Influenza forecasting. Friendly user interfaces were
  developed, delivering a customizable information system kit for many
  epidemiologic purposes. It allows for remote data collection, automated and
  real-time analyses and feedback of information. Since 1997, this concepts has
  been successfully applied to WHO global monitoring of diseases, such as
  influenza, dengue, rabies, and antimicrobial resistances.

AB: Purpose: Trachoma is a blinding eye disease caused by Chlamydia trachomatis.
  Current trachoma control programs utilize the prevalence of clinically active
  trachoma as a guide for antibiotic treatment of the chlamydial infection. We
  evaluated the validity of clinically determined active trachoma as a surrogate
  for chlamydial eye infection using the ligase chain reaction (LCR) to identify
  C. trachomatis. Methods: The sample population consisted of 1,059 subjects age
  1-15 years from a clinical trial which compared mass treatment with oral
  azithromycin to topical tetracycline in a hyperendemic area of Egypt (the
  Azithromycin in the Control of Trachoma study, ACT). Using the WHO's simplified
  grading system for trachoma, participants were clinically active if they had 5
  or more follicles (TF) or intense inflammatory infiltration (TI) on the central
  upper tarsal conjunctiva. At each exam conjunctival swabs were tested by LCR to
  detect C. trachomatis DNA. Results: The peak prevalence of both clinical
  activity, 120 of 190 (63%; 95% CI 56-70%), and infection, 110 of 186 (59%; CI
  52-66%), occurred in 3 to 4 year olds and then decreased with age.
  Pretreatment, 110 of 355 (31%; CI 26-36%) clinically active children age 1-10
  did not have infection by LCR. However, 108 of the 353 infected children (31%;
  CI 26-36%) were not clinically active. Only a single infection would have been
  missed using TF alone, thus using the TI grade in addition to TF added little
  benefit. The validity of the exam as a marker of infection decreased with age:
  among 1 to 5 year olds, 155 of 200 clinically active cases (78%; CI 71-83%)
  were infected, whereas among 11 to 15 year olds, only 15 of 85 clinically
  active cases (17%; CI 10-27%) were infected (chi2 test, p<0.001). After
  treatment the clinical exam greatly overestimated the prevalence of infection;
  that is, the proportion of those clinically active who were infected declined
  from 244 of 355 (69%; CI 64-74%) pretreatment to 9 of 92 (10%; CI 5-18%) 14
  months after treatment (chi2 test, p<0.001). Conclusion: The clinical diagnosis
  of active trachoma is not always a reliable marker of infection; it is less
  reliable in teenagers and after treatment. Because trachoma control programs
  base the decision to treat on the prevalence of C. trachomatisinfection, an
  alternate strategy could be to sample populations by one of the DNA
  amplification tests to detect infection. When laboratory testing is not
  available, clinical examination may be more useful if it is limited to a
  sentinel group of either 1-10 year olds or preferably 1-5 year olds.

AB: Recently, sentinel lymph node (SN) concept has been validated for
  gastrointestinal and breast cancers. Our previous study has shown that the No.
  13 posterior pancreaticoduodenal lymph node group constitutes the major
  regional drainage site from primary tumors in the pancreatic head, and that the
  status of these nodes predicts that of the No. 16 abdominal paraaortic lymph
  node group. Based on these results, we have developed SN navigation surgery for
  pancreatic cancer, in the search for more curable and less invasive surgery. In
  brief, 2% patent blue dye is injected into the peritumoral area. Approximately
  5 min later, one or more blue-stained nodes within the area of the No. 13 lymph
  node group are identified and excised for intraoperative frozen section
  examination. The subsequent surgical decision-tree is as follows: i) if No. 13
  SNs are negative, an extended No. 16 lymph node dissection is not performed to
  reduce morbidity, and ii) when cancer is found, the No. 16 lymph nodes are
  dissected completely. Since July 1997, nine of 21 patients scheduled to undergo
  an extended curative surgery underwent SN biopsy. SNs within the area of the
  No. 13 lymph node group were identified in 8 (89%) patients. An extended No. 16
  lymph node dissection was avoided in 4 SN-negative patients. The overall 3-year
  survival rate of the 21 patients was 36%, and 4 patients (three SN-negative and
  one SN-positive patients) with stage IVa disease were alive 3 years after
  surgery. Three SN-negative patients underwent an extended curative pylorus
  -preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PpPD) with combined portal vein resection,
  but without an extended No. 16 dissection. In conclusion, SN biopsy and
  curative PpPD can increase curability, reduce morbidity, and provide long-term
  survival in patients with locally advanced pancreatic head cancer as an
  alternative to routine extended No. 16 lymph node dissection.

AB: Background: The application of lymphoscintigraphy followed by sentinel lymph
  node (SN) biopsy to patients with primary melanoma has revolutionised the
  ability to identify accurately, yet conservatively, those patients who harbour
  occult nodal metastases. The molecular detection of SN micrometastases
  facilitates the cost effective analysis of the entire SN using multiple
  markers. Currently, a lack of marker specificity is the main barrier preventing
  the molecular evaluation of SN tissue from becoming clinically applicable.
  Aims: To develop a reproducible multimarker reverse transcription-polymerase
  chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, with the emphasis on achieving high specificity
  for the accurate detection of melanoma metastases in nodal tissue. Methods:
  Three pigment cell specific (PCS) markers-tyrosinase, Pmel-17, and MART-1-and
  one cancer testis antigen (CTA)-MAGE-3-were selected for use in a multimarker
  RT-PCR assay. The conditions for this assay were optimised. Results: High
  specificity was achievable for each marker by optimising the PCR cycle number
  such that unwanted transcripts (that is, illegitimate transcripts and/or
  specific transcripts from other low abundance nodal cell types) remained
  undetectable in appropriate controls (normal visceral nodes). yrosinase was
  100% specific at 40 PCR cycles, MAGE-3 and MART-1 at 35 PCR cycles, and Pmel-17
  at 30 PCR cycles. Tyrosinase proved to be the most sensitive marker, detecting
  10 melanoma cells in 0.1 g of nodal tissue. Conclusions: Excellent
  reproducibility of the entire nodal processing and RT-PCR protocol for the
  detection of very low numbers of melanoma cells in nodal tissue was shown,
  although there is a risk of false positives using the PCS markers alone,
  because of an approximate 4-8.5% incidence rate of nodal nevi in melanoma
  draining SNs (these nevi being absent in all other normal nodes). MAGE-3 was
  shown to be the only marker that is not expressed by melanocytes. However,
  because not all melanomas express MAGE-3, it is recommended that more emphasis
  should be placed on the development of a panel of CTA markers to ensure a zero
  false positive rate and to provide optimum detection.

AB: To elucidate the functions of circulating gammadelta T cells, in the absence
  of antigen stimulation, the differential gene expression of two circulating
  gammadelta T cell subsets was analyzed. The two subsets, with distinct
  trafficking phenotypes in young calves, were GD3.5+, CD8-, WC1+ or GD3.5-,
  CD2+, WC1-, and 90-100% CD8+ and were sorted based on GD3.5 and gammadelta T
  cell receptor expression. Results from two different human arrays probed with
  cDNA from these gammadelta T cell subsets indicated that they have markedly
  different tissue-specific functions. The genes preferentially expressed by
  GD3.5+ (CD8-) gammadelta T cells demonstrated that they were highly activated,
  proliferative, and inflammatory, whereas those expressed by GD3.5- (primarily
  CD8+) gammadelta T cells were involved in promoting quiescence, consistent with
  a role for gammadelta T cells as sentinel mucosal cells, and several were
  interferon-regulated genes. Gene expression and phenotypic assays indicated
  that CD8+ gammadelta T cells were apoptotic, whereas CD8- gammadelta T cells
  were apoptosis-resistant. Differential expression of multiple genes was
  confirmed in both arrays: That of 14 genes was confirmed by quantitative
  reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and that of seven proteins was
  confirmed by flow cytometry. This novel, genomic analysis of circulating
  gammadelta T cell subsets, without confounding effects of the tissue
  microenvironment, offers new insight into the biology and development of
  neonatal gammadelta T cells.

AB: Habitat use by sexually dimorphic Bar-tailed Godwits (Limosa lapponica) was
  examined in an Australian estuary during the midwintering (November-December)
  and premigratory (March) periods of a nonbreeding season. In an area with two
  available habitats, Zostera seagrass beds and unvegetated sand flats, males
  occurred almost exclusively in seagrass, whereas the females occurred at equal
  densities in both habitats. Estimates of intake rates seemed greater for
  individuals foraging in seagrass (0.114-0.128 g dry mass (DM)cntdotmin-1) than
  on sand (0.064-0.087 g DMcntdotmin-1). Males appeared less well adapted for
  foraging on sand than in seagrass, and the presence of females could interfere
  with males' foraging on sand. The reason for the equal distribution of the
  females between the habitats probably lies in the inability of one particular
  habitat to support the entire population of females. Little interhabitat
  movement by individuals was detected. Within a habitat, sexes moved
  synchronously at the 1-ha scale but showed a degree of segregation at the
  individual scale, suggesting that some avoidance existed. Three diet types were
  observed in the godwits in the area: (1) dominated by soldier crabs (Mictyris
  longicarpus) on sand, (2) dominated by sentinel crabs (Macrophthalmus spp.) in
  seagrass, and (3) dominated by soft-bodied prey in seagrass.

AB: Reasons for performing study: Horses vaccinated against common agents of
  infectious upper respiratory disease (IURD) may not have detectable serum
  antibody and may not be protected from clinical disease. Objectives: The
  objectives of this study were to 1) investigate the serological response of
  horses to vaccination against influenza virus (H3N8 and H7N7) and equine
  herpesviruses (EHV) in a field setting and 2) evaluate associations among
  vaccination status, serum antibody concentrations, and occurrences of IURD in
  monitored horses. Methods: In this study, horses on 6 Colorado premises were
  vaccinated parenterally against influenza virus and EHV, and serological
  response evaluated. Horses were monitored, and biological samples collected
  from individuals with clinical IURD and control horses. Results: Of 173 horses,
  61 (353%), 21 (12.1%) and 4 (2.3%) seroconverted in response to vaccination
  against EHV, influenza virus H7N7 and influenza virus H3N8, respectively.
  Conclusions: Outbreaks of IURD in study horses were associated with influenza
  virus H3N8 and Streptococcus equi infection, and serological response to
  vaccination with conventional products was poor. Potential relevance: These
  results confirm that horses may not respond with detectable serological
  responses to conventional vaccination against common respiratory viruses and,
  therefore, suggest that alternate methods of protecting horses against common
  respiratory viruses should be sought.

AB: Purpose: To explore and modulate the lymphatic drainage system and to
  determine its influence on corneal graft survival in mice. Methods: Two
  microliters of 99mTC colloidal albumin (Nanocoll(R)) were injected into the
  anterior chamber of the left eye of 6 BALB/c mice. Four groups of 6 mice
  received subconjunctival Nanocoll(R) injections. The submandibular lymph nodes
  were removed either on the left 7 or 21 days prior to Nanocoll(R) injection or
  bilaterally 7 days beforehand. Twenty-four hours later blood was obtained from
  each animal by heart puncture. The right and left eyes, the right and left
  submandibular lymph nodes and the spleen and liver were removed. The probes
  were weighed, and radioactivity was measured by a well-type NaI(TI) gamma
  scintillation detector (Baird Atomic). A standard probe was measured for each
  animal to calculate the radioactivity per mg of tissue or ml of blood
  corresponding to 106 counts per minute of the injected suspension. Four further
  groups of 6 BALB/c mice each received an orthotopic corneal transplant from C3H
  mice. Three of these groups underwent preoperative submandibular
  lymphadenectomy as in the above-mentioned tracer experiments. Results:
  Radioactivity was detected as follows: 90.7% in the liver, 7.5% in the spleen
  and 1.1% in the left lymph node after intracameral Nanocoll injection; 25.2% in
  the liver, 1.5% in the spleen and 71.6% in the regional lymph node after
  subconjunctival injection. The count rate/min/mg of tissue was about five times
  higher in the left than in the right submandibular lymph node after
  intracameral injection (p<0.01). However, subconjunctival injection increased
  this factor to 200. Removal of the left submandibular lymph node dramatically
  increased the count rate in the right submandibular lymph node (p<0.01).
  Bilateral lymphadenectomy increased the count rate in the blood (p<0.01) and
  spleen (p0.05). In three animals of group 4 the transplant was clear on day 35.
  Conclusion: Our data confirm functional lymphatic drainage via the uveoscleral
  pathway and conjunctiva in mice. The more intensive lymphoid connection between
  the outer eye and the regional lymph node could potentially be manipulated to
  improve graft survival.

AB: Objective: To evaluate the feasibility of lymphoscintigraphy in sentinel
  lymph node biopsy of breast cancer. Method: Lymphoscintigraphy was performed
  after peritumoral or subdermal injection of radioactive colloid. Then, sentinel
  lymph node (SLN) biopsy guided by gamma detector probe was performed. Factors
  correlated with identification-detection rate were assessed. Results: Lymphatic
  drainage was present in preoperative lymphoscintigraphy in 88 (93%) out of 95
  patients, with 39 (44.3%) positive for lymphatic drainage other than in the
  axilla. A total of 91 (95.8%) patients had their SLN identified in the
  intraoperative procedure. The quality of lymphoscintigraphic image was closely
  related to SLN identification-detection rate in the intraoperative procedure
  (P=0.025). Conclusion: Sentinel lymph node outside the axilla can be detected
  by lymphoscintigraphy. The combination of lymphoscintigraphy and gamma detector
  probe for sentinel lymph node biopsy of breast cancer not only is acceptable
  but promising.

AB: Background: Sentinel surveillance of the antimicrobial resistance of
  Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains isolated from female sex workers in North
  Sumatra, Indonesia, has been carried out since 1975. In 1996 a high prevalence
  of N. gonorrhoeae strains with plasmid-mediated resistance to tetracycline and
  penicillin was observed. Goal: The goal was to further characterize N.
  gonorrhoeae strains isolated from a core group of patients in Indonesia with
  sexually transmitted infections in 1996. Study Design: The strains were
  characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, plasmid analysis,
  subtype of the tetM determinant, and analysis of genomic DNA by pulsed-field
  gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Results: A total 161 N. gonorrhoeae strains
  obtained from 592 female sex workers in 10 different places in North Sumatra,
  Indonesia, in 1996 were investigated. All strains exhibited plasmid-mediated
  resistance to penicillin (PPNG: penicillinase-producing N. gonorrhoeae) and/or
  tetracycline (TRNG: tetracycline-resistant N. gonorrhoeae); 115 strains were
  PPNG/TRNG (71%), 45 were TRNG (28%), and 1 was PPNG. All strains were
  susceptible to ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, kanamycin, and spectinomycin. All
  PPNG strains tested carried the 7.2-kb (Asian type) plasmid except one, which
  carried the 4.9-kb (Toronto type) plasmid. All TRNG strains except one
  contained the Dutch-type term gene. PFGE analysis of 156 N. gonorrhoeae strains
  documented that a diversity of strains existed and that certain genotypes had
  spread in a defined area or between different areas in North Sumatra.
  Conclusion: Our results underline the importance of continuous surveillance of
  the changing patterns of antimicrobial resistance of N. gonorrhoeae in high
  -risk populations.

TI: Do the soft tissues of Helix aspersa serve as a quantitative sentinel of

AB: Previous research suggests that free metal concentrations in soils are the
  best correlate of the proportion available for uptake, especially by plants.
  The same may be true for animals which ingest soil, such as earthworms and
  gastropod molluscs. Using predictions from a simple model proposed by Sauve et
  al. (Environ. Pollut. (1997) 149) and based on soil pH and total soil
  concentrations, the relationship between free soil Pb and soft tissue Pb
  concentrations is evaluated in the garden snail Helix aspersa. Five replicate
  adults collected from 23 sites in England and Wales were partitioned into two
  tissue fractions and the relationship between their Pb concentrations and those
  of their native soil was examined using simple regression analysis. Levels in
  both fractions rose with free Pb concentrations, but the terms of each
  relationship and its level of significance were greatly influenced by the most
  contaminated soils. Neither tissue fraction served as an effective sentinel of
  free soil Pb and the regression coefficient was a poor summary statistic across
  sites with a large range of contamination. The same was true of Pb
  concentrations in the whole soft tissues. It may be that free ion
  concentrations are not indicative of metal availability to animals with a range
  of mechanisms to assimilate nutrients, perhaps because of undescribed
  environmental and physiological factors governing assimilation or limiting soft
  tissue concentrations.

AB: A nuclear or leader species is the one around which foraging activity is
  organized. In the campo-cerrado (Brazilian savannah) up to four bird species
  (Saltator atricollis, Cypsnagra hirundinacea, Mimus saturninus, and Neothraupis
  fasciata) may function as nuclear or leader species in mixed species flocks.
  The aim of this study was to assess the features shown by these nuclear
  species. I quantified parameters of sociality, communication and alertness of
  nuclear bird species in mixed flocks with different composition. Parameters
  related to sociality (mean intraspecific group size) and communication
  (frequency of contact calls) were not correlated with the leadership. On the
  other hand, the most alert species was in the front of a given mixed flock most
  of the time. The leader species spent more time in vigilance and gave most
  alarm calls due to approaching raptors earlier. The results of this study
  strongly suggest that the alertness of a species is the major character of
  nuclear bird species in mixed flocks of the campo-cerrado.

AB: Background: The disease status of axillary lymph nodes at diagnosis is the
  most powerful predictor of prognosis for patients with breast cancer. Axillary
  lymph node dissection (ALND) has been the standard treatment. Recently,
  lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) have been suggested as
  alternatives to ALND. However, a clear indication for SNB has not yet been
  established. The goal of this study was to determine which patients might best
  benefit from the SNB method. Methods: A retrospective study compared the
  relationship of age, menopausal status, tumor size group, histology and
  clinical evaluation of nodes to histological axillary lymph node status in 5892
  consecutive Japanese breast cancer patients who underwent ALND. A simulation
  analysis with reported SNB sensitivity and specificity was carried out.
  Results: Clinical lymph node evaluation was the most relevant factor to predict
  axillary nodal status. However, even patients with no clinical nodal
  involvement (NO) showed only 71% axillary nodal negativity. Tumor group based
  on tumor size and histology also related to axillary nodal status. The
  simulation analysis revealed that of patients with negative lymph node
  probability, more than 66% were good candidates for SNB. Conclusion: The
  clinically negative node (NO) is the most important indication for SNB.
  Therefore, the candidates for SNB should be picked from the patients with NO.
  When no histological information is available, patients whose tumor is 20 mm or
  smaller are candidates for SNB. When histological information is available, the
  SNB indication extends to patients whose type of tumor has histologically good
  prognosis or a low probability of having nodal involvement, regardless of tumor
  size.

  axillary lymph nodes on MR lymphography after intramammary injection of
  superparamagnetic iron oxide (Ferumoxides) for detection of the sentinel lymph
  node. MR lymphography was performed in a total of 11 patients with breast
  cancer without palpable axillary lymph node swelling before operation. Coronal
  and axial images were obtained before and after intramammary injection of 1.5
  ml Ferumoxides adjacent to the breast tumor. In all patients, decreased
  intensity was recognized in the axillary lymph nodes. MR lymphography could
  detect the sentinel lymph node with its decreased signal intensity 20 minutes
  after the intramammary injection of Ferumoxides.

AB: The authors have reported on 5 young patients who had brain tumors that
  appeared within 10 yr of initial occupational exposures to radar. Four of the
  patients were less than 30 yr of age when the diagnoses were initially made.
  Brief induction periods that follow high exposures in individual sentinel
  patients are a recognized indicator of impending group risk, and these periods
  call attention to the need for precautionary measures. Similarly, reports of
  short induction periods for brain cancer on the side of the head in which there
  has been prior use of cell phones may also indicate increased risk.

AB: Echinococcus granulosus is shown to occur in eastern Finland in a sylvatic
  cycle involving wolves (Canis lupus) as the definitive host and reindeer
  (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) and probably also elk (Alces alces) and the wild
  forest reindeer (Rangifer tarandus fennicus) as intermediate hosts. Even though
  the prevalence of E. granulosus in reindeer has increased in recent years, it
  is still very low (<0.013%). The results suggest, however, that the reindeer is
  a good sentinel animal to show the contamination of soil with Echinococcus
  eggs. This is the first report of wolves acting as a definitive host for E.
  granulosus in northern Europe. The parasite seems to be quite common in the
  Finnish wolf population, with a prevalence of approximately 30% in both
  intestinal and faecal samples. The present results and previous ones indicate
  that E. granulosus infection has not spread to dogs in the reindeer herding
  area.

AB: BACKGROUND. Spindle and/or epithelioid melanocytic proliferations that
  display overlapping histopathologic features of Spitz nevus and Spitz-like
  melanoma are diagnostically difficult and controversial melanocytic tumors.
  There are reports of such lesions metastasizing to regional lymph nodes, with a
  few widely disseminating, resulting in death. METHODS. The authors reviewed
  clinical and histopathologic data on all patients with atypical or borderline
  spitzoid melanocytic proliferations who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy
  (SLNB). They examined how frequently histologically problematic or borderline
  spitzoid melanocytic lesions metastasized to sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) and
  which clinical or histologic features, if any, predisposed patients to a higher
  risk lesion. RESULTS. Six male patients and 12 female patients, ages 5-32 years
  (mean, 16 years), had tumors ranging in size from 1.2 mm to 7.9 mm (mean, 3.5
  mm) in thickness. Atypical histologic features that were present most
  frequently included incomplete maturation (18 of 18 patients), deep dermal
  mitoses (16 of 18 patients), nuclear pleomorphism (10 of 18 patients), and
  focal sheet-like growth (10 of 18 patients). Eight of 18 patients (44%) had SLN
  metastasis and were offered adjuvant treatment. One of eight patients with SLN
  positive results who underwent regional lymphadenectomy had one additional
  involved lymph node. All 18 patients were alive and well with no evidence of
  recurrent or metastatic disease after a follow-up of 3-42 months (mean, 12
  months). CONCLUSIONS. Histologically atypical or borderline spitzoid,
  melanocytic tumors are diagnostically challenging and controversial melanocytic
  lesions, some of which represent unrecognized melanomas. SLNB aids in
  confirming a diagnosis of melanoma and identifies patients who may benefit from
  early therapeutic lymph node dissection and/or adjuvant therapy.

AB: BACKGROUND. The current study was performed to compare the value of sentinel
  lymph node dissection (SND) and axillary lymph node dissection (AND) in
  improving the utility-adjusted survival for early-stage breast carcinoma
  patients. METHODS. A number needed to treat (NNT) analysis was used to compare
  SND with AND. In the NNT equation, 1/(SSND - SAND), S is the 5-year utility
  -adjusted survival. A literature review was performed to estimate 1) the
  prevalence of axillary lymph node disease for early-stage breast carcinoma, 2)
  the sensitivity and specificity of SND and AND, 3) the 5-year overall survival
  as a function of axillary lymph node involvement, 4) the risk of arm lymphedema
  as a function of the intervention performed, and 5) the utility correction (Uc;
  impairment of quality of life) for arm lymphedema. RESULTS. The NNT method of
  analysis favored SND over nearly the entire range of parameters with a sign
  change to a negative value occurring only as Uc becomes very close to unity.
  This suggests the superiority of the SND approach. Only when there is minimal
  loss of utility does AND become favored and then only minimally. CONCLUSIONS.
  Compared with AND, SND improves the utility-adjusted survival in patients with
  early-stage breast carcinoma. This finding is quite robust and was found to
  remain constant over a range of values for utility and lymph node prevalence.

AB: Unlike animals which are carriers of foot and mouth disease (FMD), sub
  -clinically infected animals may be highly contagious. The implications of sub
  -clinical infections for the control of FMD are serious because such animals
  are likely to disseminate the disease when in contact with susceptible
  livestock. Recent dissemination of FMD virus (FMDV) in Europe shows that sub
  -clinically infected animals render trade in animals or animal products a
  potential risk for importing countries. This clearly demonstrates that the
  paradigm 'free of FMD without vaccination' is not synonymous with 'risk-free'.
  The risk of introduction of sub-clinical FMD into FMD-free countries may
  increase significantly, with the occurrence of large susceptible animal
  populations, changed agricultural practices, expansion of trade in live animals
  and animal movements, increased trade in animal products and greater mobility
  of people. Such changes in circumstances require that national and
  international authorities remain continuously vigilant to determine any altered
  risk for importation of FMD. A few historical reports and some recent
  observations in southern Africa indicate the possibility of dissemination of
  FMD by bovine carriers into herds of susceptible cattle. These reports have
  greatly influenced FMD trade policies and thus, FMD control and eradication
  strategies. However, other field evidence does not support this claim and
  several controlled experiments were unable to show that carriers are able to
  initiate disease. When millions of cattle were systematically vaccinated with
  good quality vaccines, FMD disappeared in spite of a large sentinel population
  in the form of calves and unvaccinated sheep and pigs. A low number of carriers
  most likely persisted, but they did not hamper the eradication of the disease.
  Vaccination policies and trade regulation must be based on risk assessments
  taking these factors into consideration.

AB: Objective: The objective of this article is to provide a comprehensive
  overview of the evolution of the Mexican HIV/AIDS surveillance system between
  1986 and 2001. Design: All information was collected through an extensive
  literature search. Methods: Databases such as the Mexican National AIDS
  Programmes RIMSIDA (Registry of Mexican AIDS Research), MedLINE, PopLine, and
  AIDSLINE were used. Databases, keywords, and MeSH headings to search were
  discussed and agreed upon before and during the literature search. Results: Two
  hundred and twenty articles and conference abstracts were reviewed and showed
  that the Mexican surveillance system has undergone many adaptations. The
  HIV/AIDS surveillance system began in 1986, when the focus was on identifying
  AIDS cases. This period was followed by special studies among risk groups, and
  served as the basis for the sentinel surveillance system that was adopted in
  1990. The system now requires HIV and AIDS case reporting as well as sentinel
  surveillance. Mexico has also carried out the piloting of the behavioural
  surveillance component of Second Generation Surveillance. Conclusion: The
  Mexican experience illustrates how surveillance systems need to be dynamic in
  order to monitor trends in HIV over time. This review also demonstrates that
  middle-income countries can successfully implement surveillance systems.
  However, although Mexico has had many successes, a need exists to address
  issues that limit its ability to implement AIDS case and behavioural
  surveillance fully and consistently.

AB: RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The capability of an indirect computed tomographic
  lymphography (CT-LG) using a non-ionic monometric contrast medium iopamidol for
  visualizing breast lymphatic pathways was preliminarily tested. MATERIALS AND
  METHODS: In 10 female dogs, a total of 0.5 and 1 mL of undiluted iopamidol was
  injected subcutaneously into the skin areas overlying the both caudal mammary
  glands. Contiguous 2-mm-thick multidetector raw helical CT images were obtained
  through the upper thorax and axilla before and during 60 minutes after gentle
  massage at the injection sites, with reconstruction into three-dimensional (3D)
  postcontrast CT images. The first lymph node (1st LN) directly draining from
  the injection sites was marked under CT guidance, followed by pre- and
  postmortem examinations. This CT-LG with 2-mL iopamidol was also attempted in
  five human female volunteers. RESULTS: Even with 0.5-mL iopamidol, the CT-LG
  clearly visualized the direct connection of the 1st LN and lymphatic vessels
  draining from the injection sites throughout the examination time in all the
  animals, with the maximum CT attenuation of 269 Hounsfield units (HU)+-137 in
  the 1st LN on the first postcontrast images. The topographic 3D images provided
  comprehensive anatomic outlines of these lymphatic pathways. Of the total of 20
  opacified 1st LN and 110 distant nodes, all the 1st LN (100%) and 92 (83.6%)
  distant nodes could be resected at pre- or postmortem, with a good correlation
  with the CT images. The CT-LG also effectively localized the 1st LN with the
  maximum attenuation of 223 HU+-63 in the human volunteers, without any
  significant late adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Indirect CT-LG with iopamidol may
  have excellent potential for visualizing breast lymphatic drainage and for
  preoperative localization of breast sentinel lymph nodes.

AB: A sentinel surveillance system of the public health service for acute
  respiratory diseases (ARD), especially influenza, has been realized in the Free
  State of Saxony of Germany for 25 years. The epidemiological sentinel is based
  on weekly registration of morbidity and mathematical-statistical calculations.
  For a microbiological sentinel, a fast diagnosis by nucleic acid amplification
  techniques and improvements of sample management in connection with the rapid
  transmission of results have been introduced. In the present report, the
  ARD/influenza sentinel is demonstrated for the season 2000/2001. The sentinel
  system provides scientific and practical information for a prophylactic and
  therapeutic control program. Economic significance has been proved by
  verifiable numerical data derived from several epidemiological and
  microbiological investigations. The realized system has been considered
  superior to the influenza surveillance scheme of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft
  Influenza (AGI, Marburg, Germany) for all Germany and another system of a
  pharmaceutical company which is under construction.

AB: Real-time surveillance information is the prerequisite for accurate
  influenza diagnosis followed by appropriate treatment of acute influenza with
  neuraminidase inhibitors. With REALFLUTM Surveillance, Hoffmann-La Roche has
  developed an international early warning system for influenza. The feasibility
  of the newly developed real-time influenza surveillance in Germany was tested
  and the results were compared with those of the established German influenza
  sentinel system of Influenza Study Group (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Influenza, AGI).
  The evaluation of the REALFLUTM Surveillance was performed during the winters
  of 1999/2000 and 2000/2001. The percentage of influenza-like illnesses among
  patients seen by the reporting physicians and positives of the Roche Influenza
  A/B Rapid Test were reported daily by internet, evaluated and could be called
  up on dynamic internet web pages real-time. The group of project participants
  could at any time call up the evaluations of the current data on password
  -protected internet web pages. A retrospective comparison with data obtained by
  the AGI showed good agreement between the two systems. Even better agreement
  was obtained on comparing the data with the virus isolates of the National
  Reference Centers (NRZ). This confirms the reliability of the selected
  methodology. REALFLUTM Surveillance provided information about influenza
  outbreaks 1-2 weeks earlier than NRZ and the AGI. The results show that it is
  possible and reasonable to conduct influenza surveillance on a real-time basis.
  In an overall context of REALFLUTM Surveillance, the German pilot project was
  capable of reflecting the influenza situation on a real-time and regionalized
  basis during both winters. The Roche Influenza A/B Rapid test proved to be a
  useful surveillance tool.

AB: This study examined the lymphatic drainage after injection of a radiotracer
  into the upper medial quadrant of the breast in healthy women. Most studies of
  lymphatic pathways of the breast have been performed in patients with breast
  cancer and concentrate on the upper lateral quadrant of the breast because of
  the high incidence of carcinoma at this site. The lymphatic drainage pathways
  of the medial half of the breast, however, has been less studied. A radiotracer
  (Tc-99m human serum albumin nanocolloid or HSA) was injected intradermally into
  the upper medial quadrant of the right breast in 12 healthy women. Dermal
  markers were placed at the middle of the clavicle, the axilla and at the
  jugular incisura. Three minutes after injection a static image of the injection
  site was made with a scintillation camera (Multispect 2 Gamma Camera System)
  over 20 seconds. After nine minutes, local soft massage was instituted at the
  injection site for 6 minutes. Fifteen minutes after injection, a graphic
  scintigraphic image was made of both breasts and axillae over 22 minutes. After
  this interval, three or four static images were made for a few seconds to
  locate the sentinel lymph node as related to the injection site. A sentinel
  lymph node (lymphatic pathway) in the axilla was visualized in 11 subjects
  (91.9%) and was undetected in one subject (8.3%). The radiotracer migrated in
  all patients (100%) towards the ipsilateral axilla. In 9 subjects, the sentinel
  lymph node was visualized 15 minutes after injection, whereas in 2 subjects it
  appeared within an hour.

AB: Background and aim: Several cases of acute colitis induced by non-steroidal
  anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been reported but the general role of
  recent NSAID intake as a risk factor for acute diarrhoea has not been studied
  to date. The aim of our study was to determine whether the risk of acute
  diarrhoea is increased by NSAIDs in a prospective series of acute diarrhoea
  cases which were seen by general practitioners in France and were serious
  enough to require a stool culture. Patients, physicians, and methods: A total
  of 285 consecutive patients with acute diarrhoea, seen by Sentinel general
  practitioners (GPs) between December 1998 and July 1999, were enrolled in a
  case crossover study in which each case served as his/her own control. GPs
  collected information on exposure to NSAIDs during the four month period
  preceding the onset of diarrhoea. The relative risk of NSAID related acute
  diarrhoea was estimated by comparing exposure to NSAIDs during a risk period
  preceding the onset of diarrhoea with exposure during the first part of the
  four month observation period. Three risk periods lasting for one, three, and
  six days before the onset of diarrhoea were considered. Results: The relative
  risks of acute diarrhoea due to recent NSAID intake were increased for all
  three risk periods. These risks and their confidence intervals were 2.9 (1.4
  -6.1) for the one day risk period, 2.7 (1.4-5.1) for the three day period, and
  3.3 (2.0-5.4) for the six day period. Conclusion: Recent NSAID intake emerges
  as a risk factor for acute diarrhoea. We suggest that acute diarrhoea seen in
  general practice, and not only acute colitis seen by gastroenterologists,
  should be considered as a potential complication of recent NSAID intake.

AB: In 1997, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Mexican
  Secretariat of Health, and border health officials began the development of the
  Border Infectious Disease Surveillance (BIDS) project, a surveillance system
  for infectious diseases along the U.S.-Mexico border. During a 3-year period, a
  binational team implemented an active, sentinel surveillance system for
  hepatitis and febrile exanthems at 13 clinical sites. The network developed
  surveillance protocols, trained nine surveillance coordinators, established
  serologic testing at four Mexican border laboratories, and created agreements
  for data sharing and notification of selected diseases and outbreaks. BIDS
  facilitated investigations of dengue fever in Texas-Tamaulipas and measles in
  California-Baja California. BIDS demonstrates that a binational effort with
  local, state, and federal participation can create a regional surveillance
  system that crosses an international border. Reducing administrative,
  infrastructure, and political barriers to cross-border public health
  collaboration will enhance the effectiveness of disease prevention projects
  such as BIDS.

AB: Objectives: One of the most important prognostic features of malignant
  melanoma is the involvement of regional lymph nodes. The aim of this study is
  to identify the sentinel lymph node which is the first node to be involved by
  metastases from malignant melanoma and then decide which patients can benefit
  from lymph node dissection and which will only need clinical follow-up.
  Methods: Forty-four patients were included in this study from October 2000 to
  November 2001. The study was carried out at the St. Bartholomew's and Royal
  Hospital, London, United Kingdom. We undertook a pilot study of patients with
  malignant melanoma involving the outline technique. A consent form for all
  patients was taken. The only criteria for inclusion in this study was the
  Berslow thickness of the tumor which had to be over 2 mm. There were 18 females
  and 26 males, mean age of 57 years. The primary tumor site varied: upper limbs
  14, lower limbs 10, trunk 18, and head and neck 2. Results: Excision of one to
  3 sentinel nodes (mean 1.4) was performed. The number of sentinel nodes was
  removed: one in 24 patients, 2 in 12, 3 in 6, and 4 in 2 patients. In 8/44
  patients metastatic disease was detected in the sentinel node. Three patients
  had therapeutic lymph node dissection. There was no major complication. Four
  patients with one positive node each (evidence of micrometastases) have gone
  for lymph node dissection; one of them had one further positive node.
  Conclusion: Sentinel lymph node biopsy is increasingly used to stage melanoma
  in order to avoid lymph node dissection in patients who clinically have no
  lymph node involvement. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is a valuable technique for
  melanoma staging; however, impact on overall survival requires longer follow-up.

AB: Multicentric or multifocal breast cancer is considered as one of the
  limitations for sentinel lymph node (SLN) localization. We did a retrospective
  analysis to evaluate the success rate, sensitivity, accuracy, and negative
  predictive values of SLN localization in multicentric or multifocal breast
  lesions. Methods: Fifty-nine patients with multifocal or multicentric breast
  lesions proven by either fine-needle aspiration (19/59), core biopsy (39/59),
  or lumpectomy (8/59) underwent SLN localization. Of these patients, 46 had SLN
  localization by both radiocolloid and blue dye, and 13 had SLN localization by
  radiocolloid alone. Approximately 10 MBq 99mTc-labeled unfiltered sulfur
  colloid in 0.3-0.4 mL were injected intradermally over the 1 or 2 breast tumor
  locations 2-4 h before surgery. During surgery, vital blue dye was injected
  intraparenchymally in 4-6 places around the tumor. All lymph nodes with counts
  of >10 times that of the background counts, whether or not blue dye positive,
  and all blue dye-positive lymph nodes, whether or not radiocolloid positive,
  were excised and labeled accordingly. All lymph nodes underwent frozen
  sectioning and were examined by hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistologic
  (cytokeratin) staining. Results: Of the 59 patients, 48 had axillary lymph node
  dissection irrespective of the results of pathologic examination of the SLN.
  The success rate, sensitivity, negative predictive value, and accuracy were
  93%, 100%, 100%, and 100% using the radiocolloid probe, 87%, 100%, 100%, and
  100% using blue dye, and 93.5%, 100%, 100%, and 100% using combined methods,
  respectively. Concordance between blue dye and radiocolloid was 91% (the
  incidence of the number of sentinel nodes detected was 37.5%, 30.3%, 10.7%, and
  21.4% for 1, 2, 3, and 4 or more lymph nodes, respectively). Metastatic lymph
  node involvement was found in 39.5% of patients. Conclusion: The sentinel node
  localization approach showed a high negative predictive value in breast cancer
  patients with multifocal or multicentric lesions, contrary to the common belief
  of significant false-negative results in these patients.

AB: Clinical studies have demonstrated that high dose adjuvant interferon
  therapy improves disease-free and overall survival among high risk (stage IIb
  and III) melanoma patients. Sentinel lymph node mapping (SLM) has been shown to
  accurately detect micrometastasis and may be used to identify higher risk stage
  II patients, who might benefit most from adjuvant interferon therapy. We
  modelled the cost-effectiveness of first testing with SLM and then treating
  with adjuvant interferon (IFN) therapy for stage II melanoma. We used a
  decision analytical model to compare four strategies for stage II patients
  after surgical excision of their melanoma: (1) treat all with low dose IFN; (2)
  test first with SLM and then treat only those with positive micrometastasis
  with high dose IFN; (3) test first with SLM and treat positives with high dose
  IFN and negatives with low dose IFN (test and treat appropriately); and (4)
  surgery only. Treatment, toxicity, follow-up and relapse costs were included
  over a 5 year time period. The primary outcome was cost per quality-adjusted
  relapse-free life year saved. Our analysis shows that, compared with the
  current surgery-only strategy, all three treatment strategies provide
  incremental benefits. The test and treat appropriately strategy is the most
  effective, with an incremental improvement of 0.64 quality-adjusted life-years
  (QALY). The cost-effectiveness of test and treat some with high dose IFN
  compared with the surgery-only strategy is dollar sign18 700/QALY. The test and
  treat appropriately strategy is also cost-effective compared with test and
  treat some at dollar sign31 100/QALY. In conclusion appropriate dosing of IFN
  therapy based on the results of SLM is a cost-effective strategy for stage II
  melanoma patients.

AB: The status and relevance of repetitive nucleotide sequences or
  microsatellite alterations in sporadic cutaneous melanoma has not been fully
  clarified. In this study we evaluated the presence of microsatellite
  alterations in a series of sporadic primary and metastatic melanomas in order
  to discover which genetic events may have a pathogenetic role in the
  development of this disease. Tumour samples were obtained from 21 patients with
  sporadic cutaneous melanoma, and from eight corresponding positive sentinel
  lymph nodes and one corresponding in-transit metastasis. In each specimen,
  selected neoplastic cells were procured by laser-assisted microdissection.
  Polymerase chain reaction-based microsatellite analysis was performed using a
  panel of 11 microsatellite markers, located at chromosome 2p, 4q, 9p, 16q, 17p
  and 21q. Overall, we found microsatellite alterations in five (23.8%)
  melanomas. Of these, one case showed alteration at marker D2S2182 and one at
  marker D17S261, whereas in another case alterations at three loci, D2S2182,
  D2S2291 and D9S171, were found. The fourth patient demonstrated an alteration
  at locus D9S171 both in the primary tumour and in the histologically positive
  sentinel lymph node. The fifth case was characterized by alterations at D2S2182
  and at D17S250, whereas the corresponding in-transit metastasis showed the same
  alterations as the primary tumour and an additional alteration at IFNalpha. In
  conclusion, our study confirms previous observations that cutaneous melanomas
  demonstrate microsatellite alterations, although such instability occurs at a
  lower frequency than specific mismatch repair defects. Genetic analysis of
  metastatic lesions revealed that the same microsatellite alterations as in the
  primary tumour are seen, but additional genetic changes may develop during
  disease progression.

AB: The range of the native butterfly Pieris virginiensis Edwards has decreased
  in New York and Ontario since the 1940s. Loss of habitat and harm from Cotesia
  glomerata (L.), a braconid parasitoid introduced to North America in the late
  nineteenth century for biological control of the invasive pest butterfly Pieris
  rapae (L.), have been suggested as the causes of this decline. In western
  Massachusetts, extensive habitat suitable for P. virginiensis remains and its
  principal host plant, Cardamine diphylla, is common. We found P. virginiensis
  to be widely present, occurring at 39% of host plant patches. In laboratory
  tests, we found that both C. glomerata and Cotesia rubecula (Marshall) are able
  to parasitize and successfully develop in P. virginiensis larvae when these are
  presented on detached leaves of C. diphylla. However, when we exposed
  laboratory-reared first or second instars of either P. rapae or P. napi (both
  suitable hosts for these Cotesia spp.) as sentinel larvae on leaves of either
  Brassica oleracea or C. diphylla at sites where P. virginiensis was present, no
  parasitism by either Cotesia sp. was detected. Some sentinel larvae were
  parasitized by an unidentified ichneumonid in the genus Hyposoter. We conclude
  that in western Massachusetts, P. virginiensis is widely distributed at low
  densities and that while it is physiologically an acceptable and suitable host
  for both C. glomerata and C. rubecula, larvae of field populations of this
  butterfly are not attacked because these parasitoids do not forage in forested
  habitats, even when they are locally present in adjacent meadows. Consequently,
  we report that this butterfly is not threatened by these parasitoids contrary
  to early suggestions in the literature.

AB: Objectives: Condylomata acuminata (or genital warts) are sexually
  transmitted diseases caused by human papillomavirus. Until now, there has been
  no available epidemiologic data about this disease in France. We conducted a
  prospective study among French general practitioners (GPs) to estimate the
  incidence of consultations for external condylomata acuminata in general
  practice. We also assessed the management of patients with external condylomata
  acuminata by French GP's. Design: A panel of French general practitioners,
  members of the Sentinel network, had to fill-in prospectively a questionnaire
  for each patient with condylomata acuminata diagnosed between July and November
  2000. Results: The annual number of consultations for external condylomata
  acuminata with French GP's was estimated at 23,000 (CI 95 p. 100 21,000-25,000)
  including 15,000 new cases (CI 95 p. 100 13,000-17,000). Taking into account
  the estimations we made at the same time in office-based private
  dermatologists, we estimated the annual incidence of external condylomata
  acuminata in France at 107/100 000 inhabitants. The management of patients with
  external condylomata acuminata by French GP's was in accordance with the
  European guidelines in 54 to 78 p. 100 of cases. French GP's mostly prescribed
  chemical treatment. Discussion: A proportion of cases of condylomata acuminata
  may have not been diagnosed. Similarly, some lesions may have been wrongly
  diagnosed as condylomata acuminata, but these proportions of false positive and
  false negative remain unknown. The incidence of external condylomata acuminata
  in France is similar to those estimated in others developed countries.

AB: An investigation involving raccoons as a sentinel species at the Paducah
  Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP) and Ballard Wildlife Management Area in western
  Kentucky (USA) delineated the extent of exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls
  (PCBs). Three separate measures of hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) induction were
  used to evaluate raccoon physiological responses to PCB exposure. Hepatic CYP
  induction was estimated via determination of total CYP, dealkylase activities,
  and immunoreactive proteins. There were no differences in raccoon biomarker
  responses between study sites. Significant relationships between and among PCB
  residues and biomarkers indicated that hepatic CYP induction had occurred in
  response to PCB exposure. Pentoxy-resorufin O-deethylase (PROD) activity,
  CYP1A1, and CYP1A2 were biomarkers most closely associated with PCB exposure.
  The rank order of responses was CYP1A1 > CYP1A2 > PROD > ethoxyresorufin O
  -deethylase (EROD) as related to raccoon liver PCB concentrations, whereas the
  order was CYP1A1 > PROD > EROD > CYP1A2 when regressed with total PCB
  concentrations in abdominal fat.

AB: An investigation involving raccoons (Procyon lotor) as a sentinel species at
  the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP) in Western Kentucky (USA) delineated
  the extent of exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and PCB spatial
  distribution. Raccoon exposure to PCBs was demonstrated through analysis of
  subcutaneous fat, abdominal fat, liver, and brain tissues from raccoons
  collected at the PGDP but also was clearly evident in raccoons from a reference
  area situated along the Ohio River (USA). Raccoons with the highest tissue PCB
  concentrations appeared to be those inhabiting areas nearest the plant itself
  and most likely those that ventured into the plants interior. Male raccoons at
  the PGDP had similar concentrations of total PCBs in subcutaneous fat (1.86 +-
  0.64 mug/g) as males from the reference site (1.41 +- 0.35 mug/g), but females
  had higher PCB body burdens than those at the reference site (9.90 +- 6.13
  mug/g vs 0.75 +- 0.40 mug/g). Gross measurements of exposure to radiation
  -producing materials revealed that counts per minute exceeded background in 61%
  of PGDP raccoons compared with 27% at the reference site and five raccoons at
  the PGDP had beta counts that were more than twice the background. Differences
  among trapping success, growth rates, and serum chemistry parameters were noted
  but may have been related to habitat and other environmental and population
  density factors.

AB: Background: The association of an infectious agent with chronic fatigue
  syndrome (CFS) has been difficult and is further complicated by the lack of a
  known lesion or diseased tissue. Cell-free plasma DNA could serve as a sentinel
  of infection and disease occurring throughout the body. This type of systemic
  sample coupled with broad-range amplification of bacterial sequences was used
  to determine whether a bacterial pathogen was associated with CFS. Plasma DNA
  from 34 CFS and 55 non-fatigued subjects was assessed to determine plasma DNA
  concentration and the presence of bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences.
  Results: DNA was isolated from 81 (91%) of 89 plasma samples. The 55 non
  -fatigued subjects had higher plasma DNA concentrations than those with CFS
  (average 151 versus 91 ng) and more CFS subjects (6/34, 18%) had no detectable
  plasma DNA than non-fatigued subjects (2/55, 4%), but these differences were
  not significant. Bacterial sequences were detected in 23 (26%) of 89. Only 4
  (14%) CFS subjects had 16S rDNA sequences amplified from plasma compared with
  17 (32%) of the non-fatigued (P=0.03). All but 1 of the 23 16S rDNA amplicon
  -positive subjects had five or more unique sequences present. Conclusions: CFS
  subjects had slightly lower concentrations or no detectable plasma DNA than non
  -fatigued subjects. There was a diverse array of 16S rDNA sequences in plasma
  DNA from both CFS and non-fatigued subjects. There were no unique, previously
  uncharacterized or predominant 16S rDNA sequences in either CFS or non-fatigued
  subjects.

AB: Background: Chlamydia trachomatis infection rates in Alabama increased
  dramatically from 1996 to 1998, due in part to expanded screening. Detection of
  prevalent infection through increased testing could mask timely detection of
  the impact of screening programs on community prevalence. Goal: The goal of the
  study was to evaluate the temporal trend in C. trachomatis prevalence among
  women aged 15 to 34 years attending reproductive healthcare clinics in
  Birmingham, Alabama. Study Design: Between 1995 and 1998, systematic screening
  of the first 60 women presenting each month to each of six participating
  clinics was performed with urine-based testing for chlamydia. Results: In
  contrast to the 218% increase in chlamydia prevalence detected through passive
  surveillance, during the study period surveillance in sentinel sites revealed
  that first-visit chlamydia prevalence declined from 12.8% to 8.6%. Conclusions:
  Sentinel site surveillance served as a valuable adjunct to passive surveillance
  for determining the true trend of chlamydia prevalence during the hyperendemic
  phase of a local epidemic.

AB: Background. Although metastasis of cancer in the oral region to the
  submandibular node is well described, there has been no anatomic representation
  of lymph vessels penetrating the oral floor and draining into the node.
  Materials and Methods. Ninety specimens were obtained from formalin-fixed,
  donated cadavers. Histologic observations using serial sections followed the
  macroscopic observations. Results. In 19 of 90 specimens, we found afferent
  collecting lymph vessels exiting from the mylohyoid surface and draining into
  the preglandular submandibular node. In 3 of the 19 specimens, collecting
  vessels passing through the narrow muscle gap with or without arteries, veins,
  and nerves were identified histologically. The postglandular submandibular node
  was not evident in the drainage route. Conclusions. Although it carries a low
  incidence, because of the direct lymphatic route or pathway between the oral
  region and preglandular submandibular node, the pathologically positive
  supraomohyoid node sometimes seems to be found even in elective neck
  dissection. However, we speculate that sentinel node investigation would reveal
  the much more critical role of the jugulodigastric node not only as the actual
  sentinel node but also as the common terminal node along the various drainage
  routes from the oral region.

AB: Background. Lymphoscintigraphy and sentinel node biopsy (LS/SNB) is a
  minimally invasive technique that samples first-echelon lymph nodes to predict
  the need for more extensive neck dissection. Methods. We evaluated this
  technique in 18 oral cavity cancers, stages T1-T3, NO. Patients underwent CT
  and positron emission tomography (PET) of the neck, followed by LS/SNB, frozen
  section, immediate selective neck dissection, definitive histology, and
  immunoperoxidase staining for cytokeratin. Histopathology of the sentinel node
  was correlated with that of the neck specimen. Results. There were 10 true
  positives: 6 identified on frozen section; 2 on permanent histology; and 2 only
  on immunoperoxidase staining. In six, the sentinel node was the only positive
  node. There were seven true negatives and one false negative. Conclusions.
  Gross tumor replacement of lymph node architecture may obstruct and redirect
  lymphatic flow. Overall LS/SNB holds promise for oral cancer.

AB: The bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) is one of the most studied birds
  of North America, and a great amount of natural life-history information,
  including the response of various stressors on the eagles' ability to
  reproduce, are well known. In Michigan, the eagle has been chosen to track the
  trends of bioaccumulative compounds of concern across watersheds in the state.
  The state has been divided into major watersheds, and 20% of these are surveyed
  each year. A control area in northern Minnesota, Voyageurs National Park, is
  also sampled annually. We report here on the methods used, the preliminary
  results of the 1999 field season, and how differences in mercury concentrations
  varied over a 10-year period. Mercury in feathers of nestling eagles declined
  over time only in Lakes Michigan and Huron, but have not decreased among other
  subpopulations in Michigan. Concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)
  and 4,4'-DDE in blood plasma from nestling eagles have declined over time for
  most subpopulations; however, they remain greater for breeding areas associated
  with the Great Lakes' food web. Sea eagles of the genus Haliaeetus are a good
  sentinel species to track trends in bioaccumulative compounds in aquatic
  systems.

AB: Introduction: Our networked perioperative electronic medical record system
  (EMRS) superimposes authentic physiologic patient care responses in the OR and
  PACU with anesthesia care documentation. Post-operative rounding data is
  electronically scanned into the integrated database to complete the
  perioperative anesthesia outcome process. A comprehensive electronic data
  analysis of sentinel and non-sentinel patient care events can be monitored in
  terms of site of occurrance, associated response(s) to interventions, and
  potential causal factors. This automated documentation of vital signs combined
  with concise embedded patient care notations allows more time for patient care
  observation. Focused attention to patient care translates into enhanced care
  provider vigilance and improved patient safety. Electronic analysis can
  benchmark a departments performance as well as the conditions under which
  anesthesia care providers practice. The unique aspect of this system of
  analysis is that it enhances sentinel and non-sentinel event reporting (Lussos
  SA, Koch JF et al; Anesthesiology A1122 & A1123, 2000), as well as capturing
  volumes of CME material for review. A comprehesive department-specific
  documentation of patient care events can now be made utilizing a networked
  electronic data acquisition reporting system. Methods: For publication IRB
  approval was obtained. The database query period extended from January 1, 2000
  to January 1, 2001 with a case volume of 39,857 patients or apprx766 cases per
  week. Emergency cases and ASA Classifications gtoreq 3 comprised 41.9% of our
  total caseload. Electronic data entries made during the normal course of
  patient care were interrogated and cross-referenced by four methods: 1) key
  -drug entries, 2) key-drug combination entries, 3) care provider self-reporting
  and 4) coded-text key anesthesia word entries. Results: Combining reporting
  methods such as: drug entry(s), self-reporting and anesthesia coded-text
  entries allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of an anesthesia
  departments' practice conditions and patient care outcomes. This QI Event table
  represents about one-half of the process variables that are tracked on a
  monthly basis.

AB: Systems are more responsible than individuals for adverse events.
  Anesthesiologists are pivotal in the analysis of such events, however few are
  involved. Recent mandates by JCAHO have resulted in non-surgical physicians
  being involved in review of system errors that are better suited for
  anesthesiologists. Since the Sentinel Events Program (SEP) is confidential data
  from actual events cannot be presented. Our study described and analyzed the
  sequence in which systems failures occurred, pertaining to medication errors in
  the context of a vascular surgery case. A hypothetical case was presented to
  the institutional SEP. A root cause analysis (the process used to examine
  system errors) was performed. The event involved a 65y/o man who underwent an
  uneventful abdominal aortic aneurysm repair and transferred to the ICU. On
  arrival, he was pain free and fully reversed. Esmolol was ordered to treat
  hypertension, however, a 250ml bag of dopamine was sent by pharmacy labeled as
  esmolol. The systems review revealed no errors in patient identification
  process, staffing levels (the event occurred at a busier time and at shift
  change), competency, credentialing, supervision, equipment maintenance and
  training of staff. Usual safeguards for the medication started with the
  prescription, which generated a label. The IV technician picks up the label,
  double checks the order and initials it and places the label on the premixed
  bag. Root cause analysis revealed no policy regarding placement of the
  medication sticker. Some technicians place it on the front of the bag, so the
  manufacturer' s labeling can be easily read and others placed it on the back.
  The nurse verifies the information on the pharmacy label only. Recently, both
  esmolol and dopamine became a premix item from same company. They are packaged
  in a foil wrapper with diffrrent colored lettering. When the foil is removed,
  the IV bags are the same color and size. When items are returned for credit,
  they are placed back on the shelf in their respective places, but will not have
  a wrapper. It is possible that a credit item was returned to the wrong shelf
  and taken to fill an order by mistake. In summary, this case demonstrated that
  pharmacy missed two system checks. Compounding this problem was the packaging
  of esmolol and dopamine. A recommendation for bar coding medication to reduce
  human error was forwarded. Further notification was made to the manufacture
  recommending a change in packaging and to the Institute for Safe Medication
  Practices. JCAHO sets guidelines for SEP and will inspect this process during a
  survey. High-risk surgical patients are particularly vulnerable to this form of
  error as they involve multiple drug and infusion therapies. Anesthesiologists
  should be involved in SEP, not only from the context of patient safety but from
  the perioperative nature of our practice.

AB: Introduction: Experts have advocated incident reporting systems as a means
  for improving safety in medicine. The features of an ideal incident reporting
  system have been discussed extensively and include detailed, immediate
  reporting by involved participants coupled with sound, relevant, technical
  analysis distributed to the appropriate group of end-users. We hypothesized
  that the FDA's adverse event identification system for drugs in phase III
  trials has many of the features of an ideal incident reporting system, and
  sought to characterize its performance and contrast it with the likely
  performance of general medical incident reporting systems. Methods: We examined
  drugs approved for use in anesthesia during the past ten years, seeking to
  identify which agents had significant side effects identified during post
  -marketing surveillance. We then compared this experience with the expected
  performance of incident reporting systems, including the JCAHO sentinel event
  system. Results: Two of the 11 new drugs had significant side effects that were
  not identified via the Phase III incident reporting system and only became
  apparent during post-marketing surveillance. Rapid increases in concentration
  of desflurane were identified as a cause of hypertension and tachycardia.
  Rapacuronium was discovered to cause significant histamine release, resulting
  in its withdrawal from the market. Discussion: Surveillance for adverse events
  during phase III drug trials is close to the described ideal: Carefully
  selected patients are treated with study drug in a strict protocol alongside a
  control regime. Incident reports are written up by investigators familiar with
  the patient population, procedures, and drug under investigation, and
  distributed to all investigators. Despite this, new drugs frequently come to
  market with side effects which are not detected with this incident reporting
  regime. Approximately 3-4% of new drugs are ultimately withdrawn as a
  consequence of side effects discovered during post-marketing surveillance(1).
  Recognition of the limitations of Phase III trials have led to efforts to
  increase the sensitivity of practitioners to the possibility that incidents
  with 'approved' drugs may occur. Examples of such efforts include labeling new
  drugs with black triangles, and aggressive education campaigns (2). In spite of
  this, estimates of under-reporting run as high as 98% in post-marketing
  surveillance (3). Compared to the Phase III incident reporting system, existing
  and proposed healthcare incident reporting systems are considerably removed
  from the ideal. The reports they gather are heterogeneous collections of events
  that span the breadth of medical care and encompass large variations in patient
  population, practice patterns, circumstances of care, resources, and outcomes.
  Such incident reporting systems, therefore, likely to be of less utility as
  tools for detecting and characterizing new forms of failure than adverse event
  reporting systems employed during phase III drug trials.

AB: In this study patients' and female doctors' opinions about harvesting
  sentinel nodes outside the axilla are evaluated and patients' ability to
  understand the concept of sentinel node biopsy is investigated. Information
  leaflets and questionnaires were mailed to 100 patients with breast cancer who
  had undergone sentinel node biopsy and to 300 female doctors. Seventy-three
  (73%) patients and 148 (49%) female doctors returned the questionnaire. Fifty
  -eight (79%) breast cancer patients and 71 (48%) female doctors wanted
  harvesting to be done in order to determine whether the nodes were involved.
  Sixty-six (90%) patients and 128 (86%) female doctors wanted the procedure if
  it changed the treatment. Sixty (82%) patients understood the outcome of the
  sentinel node procedure. Patients with breast cancer seem to value the
  information gained by harvesting sentinel nodes outside the axilla and want the
  procedure if there is even the slightest possibility that it might change the
  adjuvant treatment.

AB: Background: The aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence of sentinel
  nodes and sentinel node metastases outside levels I-II of the axilla in breast
  cancer. Patients and Methods: Altogether 170 breast cancer patients with 172
  clinically node-negative T1-T2 tumours underwent lymphoscintigraphy and were
  included in a prospective study. Results: The lymphoscintigraphy showed
  sentinel node(s) in the axilla in 150 (87%) breast cancer cases. Thirty (17%)
  patients had sentinel nodes outside the axilla. Lymphatic drainage solely
  outside the axilla was encountered in two patients. Lymph node metastases were
  found in the axilla in 40% and outside the axilla in 17% of the 30 patients
  with extra-axillary sentinel nodes. Two patients with sentinel node metastases
  outside the axilla had no axillary metastases. Conclusion: The biopsy of
  sentinel nodes outside the axilla is a potential tool for more accurate staging
  in breast cancer, since it provides additional information as compared to
  axillary staging alone.

AB: Introduction: The auricular VX2 carcinoma of the New Zealand white rabbit
  serves as an animal model for human squamous cell carcinomas of the head and
  neck region (HNSCC), since both tumors tend to metastasize lymphatically,
  leading to early lymph node and subsequent distant metastasis. The aim of this
  study was to examine the pattern of lymphogenic metastatic spread in untreated
  auricular VX2 carcinomas, since the resulting knowledge potentially could help
  in the development of new treatment strategies for human HNSCC. Materials and
  Methods: VX2 carcinomas were implanted into both ears of 22 New Zealand white
  rabbits. The animals were sacrificed at days 7, 14, 21, 28 or 32 after tumor
  implantation, followed by a detailed histopathological examination of their
  head and neck lymph nodes. Results: On day 7 after tumor implantation 25% of
  the animals had metastases in the parotid lymph node, which is the first
  draining lymph node of the tumor region. This number rose to 87.5% by day 28.
  At this time 12.5% of all animals also had an additional metastasis in the
  second echelon node. Conclusion: A reproducible metastatic spread into the
  first draining lymph node could be demonstrated for the auricular VX2 carcinoma
  of the New Zealand white rabbit. The VX2 carcinoma therefore appears to be a
  highly suitable animal model for studying the sentinel node concept in the
  context of human HNSCC.

AB: Mast cells are important as sentinel cells in host defense against bacterial
  infection. Much of their effectiveness depends upon recruiting other immune
  cells; however, little is known about the mechanisms of this response. CCL20,
  also known as macrophage inflammatory protein-3alpha (MIP-3alpha), Exodus, and
  LARC, is a chemokine known to be a potent chemoattractant for immature
  dendritic cells and T cells. In this study, we examined the human mast cell
  production of both CCL20 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
  (GM-CSF), a critical cytokine for innate immune responses in the lung, in
  response to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot
  analysis demonstrated that the human mast cells (HMC-1) express CCL20 mRNA and
  are able to produce a significant amount (32.4 ng/ml) of CCL20 protein
  following stimulation by calcium ionophore and phorbol myristate acetate.
  Importantly, P. aeruginosa potently stimulated CCL20 production in human cord
  blood-derived mast cells (CBMC), with production peaking at 6 h after
  stimulation. This time course of expression was distinct from that of GM-CSF,
  which peaked after 24 to 48 h. Significant CCL20 production did not occur
  following immunoglobulin E-mediated activation of CBMC under conditions which
  induced a substantial GM-CSF response. Interestingly, the CCL20 response of
  mast cells to P. aeruginosa was relatively resistant to inhibition by the
  corticosteroid dexamethasone, interleukin-10, or cyclosporine, while GM-CSF
  production was potently inhibited. However, P. aeruginosa-induced CCL20
  production was blocked by the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor Ro 31-8220 and a
  PKC pseudosubstrate. These results support a role for human mast cells in the
  initiation of immune responses to P. aeruginosa infection.

AB: The aim of this study was to demonstrate that radionuclide sentinel node
  detection can be applied to patients with non-palpable breast cancer. One
  hundred and ten consecutive women with unilateral breast cancer were studied.
  Group 1 was made up of 80 patients with palpable breast cancer (mean age, 58
  years) and group 2 of 30 patients with non-palpable breast cancer detected
  mammographically (mean age, 55 years). 99mTc-nanocolloid (111 MBq) was injected
  peritumorally in palpable tumours, and in the tumour area (ultrasound guided)
  in non-palpable tumours. At 2 h post-injection, anterior and lateral
  scintigrams were obtained from patients in the supine position. The location of
  the sentinel node was marked on the patient's skin. Patients with non-palpable
  tumours were moved to the surgery room 3 h later, and those with palpable
  tumours 24 h later. The histopathological study included three
  haematoxylineosin sections and immunochemistry. All patients underwent axillary
  lymphadenectomy. The sentinel node was detected in 67 cases (84%) in group 1
  and in 28 cases (93%) in group 2. In four patients (5%) in group 1 and two
  patients (7%) in group 2, no axillary sentinel node was detected in the
  surgical bed, although it had been seen in scintigraphy. In nine patients (11%)
  in group 1, neither scintigraphic nor surgical detection was successful. Skip
  metastasis was seen in six cases (10%) of palpable tumours and in one case (4%)
  of non-palpable tumours. It can be concluded that non-palpable breast tumours
  cannot be considered an exclusion criterion for sentinel node localization and
  biopsy. Ultrasonography-guided injection, followed by scintigraphic and
  surgical detection of the sentinel node, may help in the management of patients
  with non-palpable breast tumours.

AB: The III Meeting of the Network for Surveillance of Emerging Infectious
  Diseases in the Amazon Countries took place in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, from 9
  to 11 March 2001. Public health professionals, representatives of international
  institutions and governmental cooperation agencies participated in the meeting.
  During the first session, antimalarial drug policy and the current state of
  resistance to the drugs in the respective countries were analysed. Within the
  framework of the Roll Back Malaria initiative, the importance of early
  diagnosis and the timely treatment of the disease; the need for strategies and
  implementation of multiple preventive activities based on local requirements;
  and the need for coordination among distinct groups and organizations involved
  in prevention and control activities against the disease were emphasized.
  Additionally, the importance of conducting operational research in order to
  solve bottlenecks observed in several of the national programs was stressed. A
  summary was made of the epidemiological malaria situation in the Americas,
  which is included in Annex 1. Malaria transmission occurs in 21 countries of
  the Region. All of them have programs to control the disease. Due to the
  importance of the monitoring antimalarial drug resistance in the Region,
  information on the experiences about the subject in other continents was
  considered useful. Information was shared on activities in the East African
  countries and USAID supported activities in the Mekong, Southeast Asia Region.
  The countries of the Amazon region presented reports on their respective
  national situations with regard to antimalarial drug resistance and to its drug
  treatment policies. In turn, each country committed to joint efforts to
  undertake monitoring of the resistance and to use acquired information as the
  basis for rational malaria treatment policies. The 'U.S. Agency for
  International Development', the World Health Organization, and PAHO were
  committed to supporting the efforts. During the second session, different
  aspects of syndromic surveillance were discussed, both as a way of implementing
  surveillance of the emerging/reemerging diseases, as well as its importance in
  regulation of reagents and quality control of same in order to confirm
  suspected clinical cases. Both Brazil and Colombia described the existing
  national experience in this regard. Subsequently the activities carried out by
  the countries of the Region and PAHO in promoting surveillance of antibiotic
  resistance and of potential for contention of that resistance were described.
  The participants made the following recommendations to countries and agencies
  represented at the meeting: Session I: Malarial drug policy in the Amazon
  countries. Monitoring of drug resistance. To the countries: Each country will
  have a national coordinator for monitoring drug resistance; a common protocol
  developed by PAHO/WHO and adapted to the Region of the American will be used in
  carrying out the monitoring of the resistance to the drugs by Plasmodium vivax
  and Plasmodium falciparum. The databases for the studies of resistance will be
  shared between all the countries and its structure will be discussed among them
  (Brazil already has a database and should send it all the countries for its
  analysis and potential use); a Steering Committee at the national and
  subregional level will be created in order to supervise the studies and
  sentinel sites and Dr. Ruebush will act as monitor of the tests in order to
  establish the efficacy of the antimalarial drugs. TO PAHO and to WHO (Roll Back
  Malaria): That they support the organization of the national and subregional
  networks for monitoring resistance. To the Agency for International Development
  (AID), USA: That it provides financial support so that the activities of the
  network can be undertaken. Session II. Surveillance of other
  emerging/reemerging infectious diseases. To the countries: That they carry out
  monitoring of antibiotic resistance-to antibiotics in specimens isolated in the
  community and in nosocomial infections, following the standards of quality
  assurance and analyze and periodically disseminate results of such
  surveillance. To PAHO: That a system of evaluation be established to measure
  performance of institutions from countries that participate in the network for
  laboratory diagnosis of emerging/reemerging diseases, and that two topics to be
  included in future meetings be: national systems for surveillance of the
  antimicrobial resistance and viral emerging/reemerging diseases.

AB: Objective: The aim was to determine the feasibility of surgical
  identification and pathological ultrastaging of sentinel nodes (SNs) in vulvar
  carcinoma and to evaluate whether SN negativity rules out the possibility of
  metastasis in other nodes and can therefore avoid conventional lymphadenectomy.
  Material and methods: In 26 patients with vulvar squamous cell carcinoma the
  SNs were detected using both peritumoral injection of 99mTc and blue dye
  (isosulfan or methylene) before the surgical procedure. Dissection of the SNs
  was followed by standard lymphadenectomy and vulvar exeresis. For pathological
  ultrastaging at least eight histological sections of every node separated 400
  mum were evaluated using hematoxylin & eosin and immunostaining against
  cytokeratin. Results: We identified the SNs in 25/26 patients (96%). In 19
  patients (76%) the SN was unilateral and in 6 (24%) it was bilateral. A total
  of 46 SNs were isolated. Metastatic carcinoma was identified in 9 SNs from 8
  patients (30.8%). Thirty-eight percent (3 of 8) patients with metastatic SNs
  presented micrometastasis detected only in ultrastaging. Seven (3.3%) of 239
  nonsentinel nodes (non-SNs) showed metastasis. No metastatic implant was
  detected in non-SNs when SNs were negative in patients without clinical
  suspicious adenopathy (100% negative predictive value). Conclusion:
  Inguinofemoral lymph nodes can be confidently avoided when sentinel node
  metastases are excluded by histological ultrastaging. This may reduce the
  surgical morbidity of conventional inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy, without
  worsening vulvar cancer prognosis.

AB: Background: The presence of an ear deformity has been suggested as a sign of
  difficult intubation, based on embryological fact that the ear and the mandible
  are derived from the first and second branchial arch and cleft. Thus, an ear
  anomaly may be associated with mandibular hypoplasia, which may in turn make
  displacement of the tongue difficult during direct laryngoscopy. We
  hypothesized that anesthesiologists caring for children with microtia would
  encounter a difficult airway more frequently in such patients compared to
  children with normal facial anatomy. Methods: After IRB approval and parent
  consent, we enrolled consecutive 93 school-aged patients with microtia
  undergoing reconstructive ear surgery. For each patient with microtia, an age
  -matched patient with normal facial anatomy was recruited to serve as a
  control. Because microtia is one component of hemifacial microsomia (HFM),
  patients were examined for the presence of the five dysmorphic features of the
  OMENS classification of HFM: Orbiatl distorsion, Mandibular hypoplasia, Ear
  anomaly, Nerve involvement, and Soft tissue deficiency. After a standardized
  anesthesia induction, direct laryngoscopy was performed by the single pediatric
  anesthesiologist, and the degree of difficulty of laryngeal view was assessed
  using the Cormack classification. Laryngoscopic grade was grouped as difficult
  for Grades 3 and 4, and easy for Grades 1 and 2. Chi-square tests, Fisher's
  exact tests, and Spearman rank correlation were used for data analysis. P<0.05
  was considered as significant. Results: Of the 93 patients with microtia, 11
  had bilateral anomalies and 82 had unilateral anomalies. The incidence of
  difficulty in laryngeal visualization was 36%(bilateral), 4%(unilateral), and
  0% (control). The incidence was markedly greater with bilateral microtia than
  with unilateral microtia or the control (P = 0.001and 0.0001, respectively). In
  contrast, no significance was found between unilateral microtia and the control
  (P = 0.2). With regards to concurrent OMENS classification abnormalites, all
  the patients with difficult laryngoscopy had mandibular hypoplasia. Other
  abnormalities were not always present in those with difficult laryngoscopy.
  However, they may increase the predictive value of the mandible in identifying
  the patients with difficult laryngoscopy because there were strong positive
  correlations between the number of involved abnormal components and the degree
  of difficult visualization of the larynx in patients with both unilateral and
  bilateral microtia (Rs = 0.89 and 0.81, respectively). Conclusions: Microtia,
  particularly bilateral microtia, may be a sentinel sign of a difficult airway
  in school-aged children. Additional facial abnormalities should be sought
  carefully, because the more associated facial abnormalities found, the greater
  the suspicion for a difficult airway should be.

AB: Introduction. The advantages of combined spinal-epidural anesthesia (CSE) in
  obstetric practice are well documented (1), while its benefits for orthopedic
  procedures are now being explored (2). Techniques that extend analgesia
  postoperatively have been shown to improve outcome and shorten rehabilitation
  after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) (3). We sought to determine the effect of
  CSE, which combines short onset time with the capacity for post operative
  analgesia, but is technically complex to perform, on operating room efficiency.
  Methods. A retrospective chart review was undertaken of all total hip
  arthroplasties (THA) and TKAs, between February 1 and July 31, 1999, at a 1,200
  bed tertiary care university hospital. Data were acquired using a computerized
  system (CompuRecord Anesthesia Records, Inc., Pittsburgh) which has touch
  screen entry for sentinel events, including anesthesia start (AS), positioning
  time (PT), surgery start (SS), surgery finish (SF) and anesthesia finish (AF).
  Anesthetic techniques included CSE, general (GA), epidural (EA) and spinal
  anesthesia (SA) in the THA group and GA, CSE and EA in the TKA group.
  ASfwdarwSS, ASfwdarwPT, SFfwdarwAF and the sums of these surgery/surgeon-
  independent time points were calculated for the THA group, while times to
  positioning were not considered for the TKAs (supine position). Kruskall Wallis
  tests were used to detect an overall difference among the different techniques.
  Differences between any two techniques were detected using a Mann Whitney U
  test. Results. Complete data were available for 62 THAs and 60 TKAs. Mean times
  for each interval appear in the Table. For the THA group the SFfwdarwAF times
  were not significantly different among the three anesthetic techniques as were
  all five time calculations between the CSE or GA groups. Times to accomplish EA
  were significantly greater (p<0.05) than both CSE and GA at ASfwdarwSS,
  ASfwdarwPT, and thus, also for the cumulative times. The SFfwdarwAF times were
  similar among the four anesthetic techniques in the TKA group. We found no
  significant differences among the ASfwdarwSS times for any of the regional
  anesthetic techniques, but ASfwdarwSS time of GA was significantly shorter
  (p<0.05) than each of the other groups. Discussion. Time to perform CSE was not
  longer than that of EA or SA, and thus its use did not negatively impact
  overall anesthesia times in any group. Onset advantages and decreased time to
  positioning make CSE preferable to EA for THA. Although GA remains the most
  time efficient technique, the intra- and postoperative advantages of regional
  techniques must be considered when developing anesthetic plans for patients
  undergoing total joint arthroplasty.

AB: Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in the treatment of breast cancer is
  essential for predicting the prognosis and regional control of the tumor. At
  the same time ALND is associated with pain, numbness and sometimes lymphedema.
  Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a potential alternative procedure to
  conventional ALND in clinically node-negative breast cancer. In this study, we
  prepared the technetium-99m-labeled tin colloids with different sizes and
  compared their efficacy in SLNB. From September 1998 to February 2002, 184
  clinically node-negative breast cancer patients were enrolled in the study at
  Keio University Hospital. Sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) were identified by both
  blue dye and radioisotope. We prepared small-sized technetium-99m-labeled tin
  colloid (particle size: 200-400 nm in diameter). Regular-sized technetium-99m
  -labeled tin colloid is 400-1000 nm in diameter. In 74 patients. a SLNB was
  performed using regular-sized tin colloid; small-sized tin colloid was used in
  110 patients. Subsequently, all of the patients were immediately followed by
  ALND. All dissected lymph nodes were evaluated by routine histopathological
  examination. The clinicopathological characteristics of the two groups were
  comparable. The lymphoscintigram detected SLN more frequently in the small
  -sized colloid group than in the regular-sized colloid group (P < 0.01). Small
  -sized tin colloid was also superior to regular-sized tin colloid in the SLN
  identification rate (97.3% versus 86.5%; P = 0.01). The mean value for ex vivo
  counts of the hottest sentinel lymph nodes of the small-sized colloid group was
  significantly higher than the counts of the regular-sized colloid group (P <
  0.01). There was no significant difference in the accuracy between the two
  groups. It was concluded that SLNB using the small-sized tin colloid was
  technically feasible and provided higher detection and identification rates
  than the regular-sized tin colloid.

AB: Background: The aim of this study was to investigate whether
  clinicopathological features affect the success rate of identifying sentinel
  nodes using a combination method of dye and radioisotope in breast cancer
  patients. Methods: Sentinel node biopsy was performed in patients (n = 154)
  with stage I and II breast cancer using a combination method. The association
  between the clinicopathological features of breast cancer and the success rate
  in the identification of sentinel nodes was investigated. Results: Sentinel
  nodes were successfully identified in 147 (95.5%) of the 154 patients. There
  was a concordance between the sentinel-node and axillary-node status in 146
  (99.3%) of 147 cases. The false negative rate of the sentinel node biopsy was
  2.4% (1/42). The identification rate of sentinel nodes was significantly (P =
  0.005) lower in patients gtoreq60 years (84.4%) than in those <60 years
  (98.4%). The tumor size, histological node status, lympo-vascular invasion,
  history of previous surgical biopsy, operative procedure, tumor location, and
  histological type were not related with the identification rate of sentinel
  nodes. The mean count ratio of all hot nodes was 14.0 (range 2.0-73.6) in
  patients >EQ60 years and 73.4 (2.0-1700.6) in patients <60 years, and this
  difference was statistically significant (P < 0.0001). In addition, the mean
  number of sentinel nodes was significantly (P = 0.0006) lower in patients
  gtoreq60 years (1.3; range one to four) than in patients <60 years (2.1; range
  one to 12). Conclusions: Patient age affects the identification rate of
  sentinel nodes using a combination method in breast cancer.

AB: Sentinel node biopsy may become a standard procedure to detect lymph node
  metastases in early breast cancer. Numerous studies have confirmed and
  demonstrated the reliability of the hypothesis of sentinel node biopsy, with a
  high identification rate and overall accuracy connected with dye-guided and
  radio-guided sentinel node biopsy. To assess the benefit of sentinel node
  biopsy, randomized clinical trials are underway in Western countries comparing
  sentinel node biopsy with conventional axillary lymph node dissection. In
  Japan, feasibility studies on sentinel node biopsy started in the mid-1990s.
  The dye and radiopharmaceuticals associated with sentinel node biopsy commonly
  used in Western countries are not available in Japan. Japanese investigators
  have attempted to perform sentinel node biopsy using other dyes and
  radiopharmaceuticals. The results from feasibility studies have been similar to
  those reported previously. In conclusion, sentinel node biopsy for breast
  cancer patients is successful in Japan. The current status and the problems are
  discussed.

AB: Breast conserving operations have become the standard operation for early
  breast cancer. They were performed in about 40% of all breast cancer patients
  in Japan in 2000, and the percentage is still increasing. Ductal carcinoma in
  situ (DCIS) accounts for about 7% of all breast cancers and breast conserving
  operations for DCIS have been followed by a low in-breast recurrence rate,
  leading to wider indications for breast conserving operations as screening
  mammography has come to be used in Japan. In-breast recurrence is correlated to
  surgical margin status. It is important to evaluate the surgical margin for
  volume of cancer cell nests as well as for positivity. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy
  has become popular as an in vivo sensitivity test and as a means of down
  -staging to increase the possibility of performing a breast conserving
  operation. There are two patterns of shrinkage when neoadjuvant chemotherapy is
  effective: cocentric and honeycomb, and the pattern of residual cancer cell
  nests must be determined before surgery. MRI is an effective method of
  evaluating residual cancer cell nests. The in-breast recurrence rate after down
  -staging to perform breast conserving operations is reported to be higher than
  among candidates for breast conserving operation at the start. Sentinel node
  biopsy techniques and endoscopic operations are now being assessed-in
  conjunction with breast conserving operations. The current status of breast
  conserving operations in Japan is reviewed in comparison with their status in
  Western countries.

AB: We examined the feasibility of sentinel lymph node biopsy for thyroid
  cancer. Thirty-eight patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma underwent
  intraoperative lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node biopsy. At surgery, we
  exposed the thyroid gland and used a tuberculin syringe to inject 0.2 ml of 1%
  patent blue dye directly into the thyroid mass. The lymphatics and the lymph
  node dyed with blue dyes, was excised as a sentinel lymph node. Modified
  radical neck dissection was performed following sentinel lymph node biopsy and
  the diagnostic ability of sentinel lymph node biopsy was examined. A sentinel
  lymph node was identified successfully in 27 (71%) of 38 patients. Sentinel
  lymph node biopsy removed one to three lymph nodes (median, two nodes).
  Eighteen patients had paratracheal sentinel lymph nodes, five patients had
  jugular sentinel lymph nodes, and four patients had both. Histological nodal
  metastasis was recognized in 16 of 27 cases. The positive rate of cancer
  metastases in sentinel lymph nodes was 58%, which was significantly higher than
  11% in non-sentinel lymph nodes. Diagnostic ability of sentinel lymph node
  biopsy showed that accuracy was 89%, sensitivity was 84%, and specificity was
  100%. Our preliminary study indicated that sentinel lymph node biopsy was
  available on detection of non-palpable nodal metastasis in the patients with
  thyroid cancer; however, further experience and refinement are needed.

AB: The subject of performing prophylactic or elective modified dissections of
  the neck in patients with clinically occult lymph nodal metastases from thyroid
  cancers is controversial since metastases to lymph nodes are associated with
  high rates of recurrences. Biopsies of sentinel lymph nodes can be performed
  successfully in patients with thyroid cancers since they can be identified with
  dyes or 99mTc. Our preliminary findings indicate that biopsies of sentinel
  lymph nodes can be useful in the treatment of thyroid cancers; however, the
  clinical significance of identifying metastases in regional lymph nodes by this
  technique remains to be determined.

AB: Objective: To evaluate the epidemiology of symptomatic human pesticide
  exposures using poison control center data and geographic information systems.
  Methods: All symptomatic human pesticide exposures reported to the poison
  center during the period from January 1 to December 31, 2000 were included for
  analysis using geographic information systems. A space-time scan statistic was
  utilized to evaluate for clustering of symptomatic human exposures. Results: Of
  322 symptomatic pesticide exposures, 297 (92%) contained spatial identifiers
  that could be further analyzed using geographic information systems. A spatial
  and temporal cluster of symptomatic pesticide exposures was identified during
  the period from April 1 to August 31, 2000, covering a large geographic area of
  eastern and predominantly rural regions of the state. The relative risk of
  reporting a symptomatic pesticide exposure among individuals living within this
  geographic area was 1.8 (log likelihood ratio=18.5, P=0.0005). Conclusions:
  Geographic information systems can be effectively utilized by poison control
  centers to study regional and temporal variation in the incidence of human
  pesticide exposures. With the collection of more specific spatial identifiers,
  geographic information systems may have many additional applications in the
  surveillance and prevention of pesticide and other sentinel event exposures.

AB: In the period 1997-2000, approximately 1,800,000 m3 of material dredged from
  the Port of Leghorn was discharged into a sea dumping site located 14 miles
  from the coast. The red mullet (Mullus barbatus) was used as a bioindicator
  species for monitoring the biological impact of these discharges on a
  geographical and temporal scale. Organisms were sampled over three years (1998
  -2000) at different stations and several biomarkers, both of exposure and
  effect, were analyzed. Bioavailability of specific classes of pollutants was
  evaluated by analyzing levels of metallothioneins, the activity of cytochrome
  P450 1A (CYP1A) and of glutathione S-transferases. Among biomarkers of effect,
  special attention was paid to the balance between prooxidant challenge and
  antioxidant defenses, and to the appearance of damage caused by oxidative
  stress. The analyses of the main components of the antioxidant system included
  superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidases, glutathione reductase,
  glyoxalase I and II, and total glutathione. These data were integrated with the
  measurement of total oxyradical scavenging capacity (TOSC) as an indication of
  the overall biological resistance to toxicity of different forms of oxyradicals
  (peroxyl radicals, hydroxyl radicals and peroxynitrite). Results indicated a
  biological impact in organisms sampled near the disposal site; the impact was
  particularly evident during 1999 and mainly related to organic chemicals such
  as PAH. Exposure to these pollutants also caused variations in the levels and
  activity of several antioxidants. The analysis of TOSC, however, revealed that
  the overall capacity of specific tissues of organisms to absorb various
  oxidants was not seriously compromised when challenged with increased
  prooxidant pressures. Variations of single antioxidants were useful in
  revealing early warning "biological responses", while integration with TOSC
  analyses indicated if such changes also reflect a more integrated and
  functional "biological effect" with possible consequences at the organisms
  level. The red mullet appears to be a useful sentinel species for a biomarker
  approach to monitoring impact caused by dredged materials.

AB: Aims: To describe presentations to emergency departments during the Sydney
  2000 Olympic Games for conditions related to the use of illicit drugs; to
  discuss the implications of such presentations for surveillance and public
  health action at similar events in the future. Design: Identification of target
  presentations in sentinel emergency departments; entry of data into a purpose
  -built database; and daily electronic transfer of data for central collation
  and analysis. Setting: Fifteen sentinel emergency departments in the greater
  Sydney metropolitan area for a 38-day period spanning the Sydney 2000 Olympic
  Games. Participants: Four hundred and twenty-four presentations to sentinel
  emergency departments with conditions related to illicit drug use.
  Measurements: Patient's age, sex, country and region of residence, location of
  emergency department, types of illicit drugs involved and departure status.
  Findings: The mean daily number of presentations for adverse events due to
  illicit drug use was significantly higher (13.3 versus 8.8 presentations,
  t=2.2, P=0.04) in the 2-week Olympic Games period than in the lead-up to the
  Games, culminating in a large peak following the closing ceremony. There was
  also a significant increase (5.1 versus 1.7 presentations, t=2.8, P=0.007) in
  the mean daily number of presentations related to use of ecstasy or
  amphetamines, whereas no change was noted in presentations related to heroin
  use. Over half (52%) of presentations occurred at two emergency departments in
  areas known as being 'hot-spots' for illicit drug use. Conclusions: Enhanced
  surveillance of adverse events following illicit drug use, possibly targeting
  known 'hot-spots', should be considered for future mass events. Advance
  preparation of preventive strategies, such as 'party-safe' messages, will
  enable rapid response to unusual patterns of illicit drug-related harm during
  future mass events.

AB: Sentinel lymph node sampling has become an alternative to axillary lymph
  node dissection to provide prognostic and treatment information in breast
  cancer patients. The role of immunohistochemistry has yet to be established. A
  total of 241 sentinel lymph nodes (in 270 slides) from 91 patients with
  invasive carcinoma (73 ductal, 9 lobular, 8 mixed lobular/ductal, 1 NOS) were
  studied for presence of macrometastases (>0.2 cm), identified in hematoxylin
  and eosin sections, and occult metastases (micrometastases (ltoreq0.2 cm),
  clusters of cells, isolated carcinoma cells), identified only by
  immunohistochemistry. Intraoperative touch preparations, frozen sections, seven
  hematoxylin and eosin levels (L1-L7), and two AE1-3 cytokeratin
  immunohistochemistries (L1, L4-5) of the entire bisected or trisected sentinel
  lymph node were examined. Thirty-one (34%) patients had 50 positive sentinel
  lymph nodes. Twenty-six (33%) sentinel lymph nodes had metastatic carcinoma (11
  macrometastases, 11 micrometastases, 3 clusters of cells, 1 isolated carcinoma
  cells) by touch preparations, frozen sections, and one hematoxylin and eosin
  (L1). Thirty-eight (43%) were positive by AE1-3 immunohistochemistry (L1) (11
  macrometastases, 8 micrometastases, 13 clusters of cells, 6 isolated carcinoma
  cells), significantly more than by touch preparations, frozen sections,
  hematoxylin and eosin L1, or hematoxylin and eosin L2-7. Cytokeratin
  immunostain on L4-5 demonstrated 31 (34%) positive sentinel lymph nodes, a
  similar frequency to cytokeratin immunostain on L1. Size of sentinel lymph node
  metastasis did not correlate with size, histologic grade, or type of primary
  breast carcinoma. AE1-3 (L1) immunohistochemistry is highly sensitive in
  delineating sentinel lymph node metastasis, especially clusters of cells and
  isolated carcinoma cells. The prognostic significance of clusters of cells and
  isolated carcinoma cells and the value of AE1-3 immunohistochemistry on frozen
  sections need to be determined.

AB: Fluorescent dust marking and sentinel pupal bags were used in 1998 and 1999
  to examine dispersal, spatial distribution, and duration of activity of mass
  -released Spalangia cameroni Perkins in a swine facility. In 1998, four
  releases were conducted in the period May-November and in 1999 a final release
  was completed in August. Males were observed in large numbers on window sites
  shortly after releases, whereas females seemed to remain in the environment.
  However, in one trial, and probably due to high air temperatures in the
  facility, a similar flight propensity toward the window sites was noted for the
  females. The distribution of parasitoids was clearly aggregated within a
  perimeter of 3 m from the release point. The duration of activity of marked S.
  cameroni, measured as the number of attacked sentinel pupal bags and
  parasitism, declined to a low level within 2 wk from the time of release. The
  results are discussed in relation to release strategies of S. cameroni in
  control of nuisance flies.

AB: Aims: Sentinel lymph node biopsy is an increasingly established procedure in
  the primary staging of high-risk melanoma patients. However, the laboratory
  evaluation of sentinel lymph node biopsies is a matter of controversy. The aim
  of this study was to determine the specificity of polymerase chain reaction
  (PCR) techniques for the evaluation of lymph nodes with regard to melanoma
  metastases in comparison with histology and immunohistology. Methods and
  results: Sentinel lymph nodes (n=41) from 29 melanoma patients and 29 lymph
  nodes from 27 patients without melanoma were analysed by histology (H&E) and
  immunohistology (Melan A, HMB45). cDNA of these lymph nodes was subjected to
  LightCycler PCR amplification using primers specific for tyrosinase and HMB45.
  Two melanoma sentinel lymph nodes contained naevus cells by histology and
  immunohistology and were therefore excluded from further evaluation. Eight
  (20.5%) of the remaining 39 melanoma sentinel lymph nodes were positive by
  histology and immunohistology and tyrosinase PCR, 15.4% (6/39) were positive
  only by tyrosinase PCR, 2.6% (1/39) were positive only by histology and
  immunohistology. HMB45 PCR revealed positive results in 7.7% (3/39) sentinel
  lymph nodes, which were also positive by tyrosinase PCR and histology and
  immunohistology. Of non-melanoma lymph nodes 13.8% (4/29) and 14.8% (4/27) of
  non-melanoma patients were positive by tyrosinase PCR but negative by histology
  and immunohistology and HMB45 PCR. Thus, tyrosinase PCR had a specificity of
  only 85.2%. Conclusions: The specificity of tyrosinase PCR and the sensitivity
  of HMB45 PCR are too low to recommend these PCR examinations for the guidance
  of therapy, in particular complete regional lymph node dissection.

  the literature. Methods: A retrospective review of the clinical features,
  management, histopathology, and prognosis of 23 consecutive patients with ring
  melanoma of the ciliary body was performed. Results: Of 8,800 patients with
  uveal melanoma treated on the Oncology Service at Wills Eye Hospital over a 25
  -year period, only 23 patients (0.3%) were found to have ring melanoma of the
  ciliary body. The mean patient age was 59 years (median, 63 years; range, 8-81
  years). The only visual symptom was blurred vision in 17 patients (74%), and
  the other six patients (26%) were asymptomatic. At the initial presentation
  elsewhere, melanoma was recognized in 13 cases (57%). In the remaining 10 cases
  (43%), the initial clinical diagnosis was glaucoma in three (13%), iris nevus
  in three (13%), cataract in two (9%), ciliary body detachment in one (4%), and
  iridocyclitis in one (4%). The patients were observed elsewhere for a mean of 3
  months before the diagnosis of melanoma was suspected and referral to Oncology
  Service was made. On examination, the tumor involved a mean of eight clock
  hours of the ciliary body. Seven patients (30%) had complete circumferential
  (360degree) involvement of the ciliary body, and 16 (70%) had incomplete (180
  -360degree) ring involvement. The mean tumor thickness was 8 mm. Associated
  findings included neovascularization of the iris in one case (4%), shallow
  anterior chamber in 11 (48%), anterior chamber inflammation in five (22%),
  cataract in nine (39%), lens indentation in eight (35%), and lens subluxation
  in three (13%). A prominent episcleral (sentinel) vessel (17 cases, 74%),
  multilobulation of the mass (19 cases, 83%), blockage of light on
  transillumination (23 cases, 100%), and ultrasonographic hollowness with
  intrinsic pulsations (23 cases, 100%) were important features differentiating
  this tumor from simulating conditions. The tumor was managed with enucleation
  in all 23 patients. Histopathologic studies revealed epithelioid cell-type
  melanoma in two patients (9%), mixed cell-type in 17 (74%), and spindle cell
  -type in four (17%). Extraocular extension was present in eight patients (35%).
  Metastasis developed in 12 of 23 patients (52%) after a mean follow-up of 55
  months. Conclusions: Ring melanoma of the ciliary body is a rare tumor that can
  remain hidden from ophthalmoscopic examination. Certain features, such as
  prominent episcleral sentinel vessels, multilobulation of the mass, light
  blockage on transillumination, and ultrasonographic hollowness with intrinsic
  vascular pulsations, suggest the diagnosis. The life prognosis is poor.

AB: Objectives.-To determine operational practices in laboratories operating
  under a Certificate of Wavier (waived laboratories), or equivalent, under the
  Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendments (CLIA) of 1988 when performing
  tests designated as having an insignificant risk of an erroneous result (ie,
  waived tests). Methods.-Waived laboratories that were part of the Centers for
  Disease Control and Prevention Laboratory Sentinel Monitoring Network project
  in the states of Arkansas, New York, and Washington were surveyed about their
  quality control (QC) and quality assurances (QA) practices when performing
  waived testing. Arkansas and Washington sent out similar questionnaires,
  whereas onsite surveys were conducted in New York. The survey in Arkansas and
  Washington also included nonwaived laboratories. The New York visits were
  designed to pilot test a regulatory inspection program for limited testing
  sites, which, in New York, are roughly equivalent to laboratories operating
  under a CLIA Certificate of Wavier and/or Provider-Performed Microscopy but are
  generally not located in physicians' offices. Laboratories visited in New York
  were selected from a list of limited testing sites and were representative of
  that population. Results.-Arkansas received responses from 211 facilities (37%
  response rate), of which 38% had Certificates of Waiver. Washington received
  responses from 190 waived laboratories (71 % response rate) and from 116
  nonwaived laboratories (32% response rate). In New York, 607 of the 2751
  limited testing laboratories were visited. Reporting laboratories in all 3
  states most frequently performed testing for glucose, urinalysis, urine human
  chorionic gonadotropin, occult blood, and group A Streptococcus antigen,
  although other waived tests were performed less frequently. Washington found
  that 57% of waived laboratories followed manufacturers' QC requirements.
  Arkansas found that 58% of laboratories doing waived tests that required liquid
  controls performed these controls, and 59% performing waived testing requiring
  electronic controls used these controls. In New York, 68% of the laboratories
  complied with the manufacturer's QC requirements for a variety of tests. Being
  accredited by an external organization or affiliated with a more complex
  laboratory improved compliance. Nonwaived laboratories in Washington and
  Arkansas complied with manufacturer's instructions at a higher rate than did
  waived laboratories. Similar deficiencies in following CLIA requirements were
  found in other areas of laboratory operation. Conclusions.-Just more than half
  of waived laboratories in 3 diverse states follow manufacturer's instructions
  for recommended QC and QA. These instructions help ensure that the test will
  produce results that have an insignificant chance of an error. Although we did
  not study the impact of this and other findings on patient care, the results
  show that imposing good laboratory practices by regulation alone was
  insufficient to ensure quality laboratory results in any location evaluated. A
  system that can continually provide accessible education on laboratory
  practices, coupled with new thoughts on the regulatory environment, is in order.

AB: Numerous immunohistochemical stains have been employed to detect metastatic
  melanoma in sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsies. HMB-45 is considered by some as
  a specific tool to detect early metastatic melanoma (1). Occasionally, one or
  two isolated HMB-45-positive cells may cause complications in diagnostic
  interpretation. The goal of this study was to evaluate the reliability of HMB
  -45 staining of SLNs with sparse isolated positive cells and to compare its
  staining with anti-Melan A antibody. HMB-45 and anti-Melan A antibody
  immunostaining was performed on (Group A) 15 histologically negative SLNs
  excised from patients with malignant melanoma (MM) and on (Group B) 15
  histologically negative SLNs excised from patients with breast carcinoma (BC).
  None of the patients had clinical evidence of systemic metastasis at the time
  of SLN biopsy. Five cutaneous biopsies with changes of postinflammatory
  hyperpigmentation (PIHP) were also stained with both antibodies. HMB-45
  staining was repeated in all Group B SLNs after blocking endogenous blotins.
  Electron-microscopic studies were performed on all cases of PIHP. Isolated HMB
  -45-stained cells were present in 6 of 15 SLNs removed for MM; 8 of 15 for BC;
  and 3 of 5 cutaneous biopsies of PIHP. HMB-45 reactivity persisted after
  blocking endogenous biotins in 6 of 8 positive SLNs from Group B. Anti-Melan A
  antibody was negative in all SLNs of group A and B and in dermal melanophages
  of all five cases of PIHP. HMB-45 positivity was demonstrated in histologically
  negative SLNs and cutaneous biopsies, especially in the milieu of aggregated
  melanophages. Phagocytosis of premelanosomes by macrophages in the draining
  lymph nodes may account for isolated cell positivity and can hinder correct
  diagnostic interpretation. HMB-45 may not be a reliable marker for the
  detection of micro-metastasis of MM and requires correlation with other
  immunohistochemical markers, such as anti-Melan A antibody, to enhance
  specificity.

AB: Aims: It has been suggested that patients with T1-2 breast tumours and
  sentinel node (SLN) micrometastases, defined as foci of tumour cells smaller
  than 2 mm, may be spared completion axillary lymph node dissection because of
  the low incidence of further metastatic disease. To gain insight into the
  extent of non-sentinel lymph node (n-SLN) involvement, SLNs and complementary
  axillary clearance specimens in patients with SLN micrometastases were
  examined. Methods: A set of 32 patients with SLN micrometastases was selected
  on the basis of pathology reports and review of SLNs. Five hundred and thirteen
  n-SLNs from the axillary clearance specimens were serially sectioned and
  analysed by means of immunohistochemistry for metastatic disease. Lymph node
  metastases were grouped as macrometastases (> 2 mm), and micrometastases (< 2
  mm), and further subdivided as isolated tumour cells (ITCs) or clusters.
  Results: In 11 of 32 patients, one or more n-SLN was involved. Grade 3 tumours
  and tumours > 2 cm (T2-3 v T1) were significantly associated with n-SLN
  micrometastases as clusters (grade: odds ratio (OR), 8.3; 95% confidence
  interval (CI), 1.4 to 50.0; size: T2-3 tumours v T1: OR, 15; 95% CI, 2.18 to
  103.0). However, no subgroup of tumours with regard to size and grade was
  identified that did not have n-SLN metastases. Conclusions: In patients with
  breast cancer and SLN micrometastases, n-SLN involvement is relatively common.
  The incidence of metastatic clusters in n-SLN is greatly increased in patients
  with T2-3 tumours and grade 3 tumours. Therefore, axillary lymph node
  dissection is especially warranted in these patients. However, because n-SLN
  metastases also occur in T1 and low grade tumours, even these should be
  subjected to routine axillary dissection to achieve local control.

AB: Aims: To evaluate two detailed step sectioning protocols for sentinel lymph
  nodes (SLNs). Methods: After vital dye or combined dye and radiocolloid guided
  biopsy, SLNs were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin wax. In protocol
  A, SLNs from 123 patients were sectioned in steps of 50-100 mum, whereas in
  protocol B, SLNs from 123 patients were sectioned at steps of 250 mum.
  Epithelial marker immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on multiple levels
  in cases with negative haematoxylin and eosin findings. Results: In groups A
  and B, 74 and 47 patients were found to have tumour cells in their axillary
  SLNs, and 19 (28%) and 18 (19%) patients, respectively, were upstaged as
  compared with the standard histological assessment. Nodal involvement detected
  by deeper sections was often micrometastatic or in isolated tumour cells.
  Conclusions: Serial sectioning and IHC are recommended for the evaluation of
  SLNs. The optimal extent of the histopathological work up should be studied
  further.

AB: Background: Data from sentinel serosurveillance are useful to estimate HIV
  infection in populations but may not be representative of the general
  population. General population-based surveys attempt to avoid selection bias
  and are the most appropriate for tracking changes in exposure to risk of HIV
  infection over time and assessing changes in behavior following prevention
  campaigns. Objectives: To provide baseline data for targeted sexually
  transmitted infection (STI) and HIV infection prevention interventions by
  studying parameters of sexual behavior and knowledge of HIV infection and STIs,
  measuring health-seeking behavior related to STIs, and measuring gonorrhea,
  Chlamydia, syphilis, and HIV-1 prevalences. Design: Population-based survey
  with stratified sampling by age group from randomly selected households in a
  suburb of Mombasa, Kenya. Methods: A standard questionnaire was administered to
  1497 consenting adults between the ages of 15 and 49 years who lived in
  randomly selected households. Urine and blood samples were obtained for the
  estimation of gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, syphilis, and HIV-1 infection
  prevalences. Results: Sexual activity in the past 12 months was limited to one
  partner in all age groups for most sexually active men (68%) and women (88%).
  More men than women reported two or more partners in the past 12 months (23%
  vs. 5%, respectively). Almost one half of those persons in the 15- to 19-year
  -old age group (56% of boys and 48% of girls) were sexually active. Condom use
  was low with all sexual partners, more so for women than for men. Reported STI
  symptoms in the past 12 months were high for both men and women. Knowledge of
  STI symptoms and HIV infection was present but incomplete. Overall HIV
  seroprevalence was 10.8%, with significantly higher rates among women (13.7%)
  than among men (8.0%). HIV seroprevalence in the 15- to 19-year-old age group
  was 3.2%. Female gender, Protestant religion, Catholic religion, and being
  divorced, separated, and widowed were significantly associated with HIV
  seroprevalence. Prevalences of gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, and syphilis
  were 0.9%, 1.5%, and 1.3%, respectively. Conclusions: This study emphasizes the
  vulnerability of young adults, in particular young women, to HIV infection and
  the need for intensive interventions in this group. The low use of condoms,
  incomplete knowledge of HIV infection and STIs, the high number of reported
  STIs, and the relatively low HIV-1 seroprevalence among the 15- to 19-year-old
  group indicate a large need for intensive STI and HIV infection prevention
  programs, especially for the 15- to 19-year-old age group.

AB: Molecular Pathology of Tumor Metastasis With the development of non-invasive
  methods, diagnosis of metastasis from various solid malignancies has become a
  routine task for diagnostic pathology. However, the differential diagnosis
  between primary and metastatic cancers and the precise identification of
  various metastatic cancer types requires the coordinated use of various
  morphological (light- and electron microscopic-), immunological and molecular
  techniques. The detection of the lymphatic spread of the primary tumor may now
  based on the sentinel lymph node technology while the identification of the
  hematogenous progression may be based on the analysis of the peripheral blood
  and the bone marrow. More and more frequently these techniques employ highly
  sensitive immunological and molecular techniques. Accordingly, clinical staging
  is now confronted with the results of molecular staging, where the only
  techniques which are able to detect cancer cells are immunocytochemistry or
  nucleic acid-based methodology. Although several clinical studies have provided
  evidences for the impact of the immunocytochemistry-based identification of
  micrometastases on the survival of patients with various type of cancers, none
  of these methods have become part of standard diagnostic protocols. Although
  more sensitive molecular techniques are being introduced to identify
  micrometastasis, their clinical significance is yet unknown. Multicentric
  clinical trials are now warranted to establish the clinical impact of molecular
  staging in various cancer types. Without the integration of these methods into
  the prognostic/predictive pathological protocols it is difficult to envision
  significant improvement in the results of cancer therapy.

AB: The authors report the findings of a prospectively collected database of
  stroke and TIA recorded from 1998 through 1999 by the 178 family physicians of
  the Belgian sentinel network. The yearly age-adjusted attack rate per 100,000
  men was estimated as 109 (95% CI=86 to 137) for left motor deficit and 75 (95%
  CI=56 to 99) for right motor deficit (p=0.011). This difference was not
  observed among women nor in the entire sample population. The authors suggest
  that handedness should be systematically recorded and compared to both sex and
  the side of the event.

AB: In squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, staging of the neck cannot
  rule out occult metastatic disease. An improved staging is necessary to avoid
  elective neck dissection in patients staged as N0. The study was performed to
  determine the feasibility of the detection of occult metastatic disease by
  ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (USgFNAC) of sentinel lymph
  nodes (SLN). Methods: Sixteen consecutive patients diagnosed with oral,
  oropharyngeal, or dermal squamous cell carcinoma who had been staged as N0
  underwent lymphoscintigraphy in double tracer technique to localize SLNs. A
  USgFNAC was performed on SLNs before elective neck dissection. The results of
  USgFNAC were compared with pathohistologic findings, which were regarded as the
  gold standard. Results: Seven of 16 patients were upstaged to N+ after
  histopathologic examination of the neck dissection specimen. In only 1 of these
  patients was metastatic disease detected by USgFNAC of the SLN. Conclusion: The
  combination of lymphoscintigraphy and USgFNAC of the SLN improves preselection
  of N+ patients and, thus, the staging procedures. However, based on present
  results this method does not seem reliable in deciding whether an elective neck
  dissection can be avoided. A biopsy of the SLN with close histopathologic work
  -up seems to be mandatory for the detection of occult metastatic disease,
  because the merely incidental aspiration of micrometastatic material within
  normal-sized lymph nodes results in a high number of false-negative results by
  USgFNAC.

AB: As part of the National Tuberculosis and Genotyping Surveillance Network,
  isolates obtained from all new cases of tuberculosis occurring in seven
  geographically separate surveillance sites from 1996 through 2000 were
  genotyped. A total of 10,883 isolates were fingerprinted by the IS6110
  -restriction fragment length polymorphism method, yielding 6,128 distinct
  patterns. Low-copy isolates (those with six or fewer bands) were also
  spoligotyped. The distribution of specific genotype clusters was examined.
  Databases were also examined for families of related genotypes. Analysis of
  IS6110 patterns showed 497 patterns related to the W-Beijing family; these
  pattens represent 946 (9%) of all isolates in the study. Six new sets of
  related fingerprint patterns were also proposed for isolates containing 6-15
  copies of IS6110. These fingerprint sets contain up to 251 patterns and 414
  isolates; together, they contain 21% of isolates in this copy number range.
  These sets of fingerprints may represent endemic strains distributed across the
  United States.

  isolates from new patients with tuberculosis (TB) underwent genotyping. We
  describe the impact that genotyping had on public health practice in
  Massachusetts and some limitations of the technique. Through genotyping, we
  explored the dynamics of TB outbreaks, investigated laboratory cross

  sites, and accurate epidemiologic links. Genotyping should be used with
  epidemiologic follow-up to identify how resources can best be allocated to
  investigate genotypic findings.

  more likely to have confirmed transmission than those linked elsewhere. Case
  pairs with unconfirmed transmission were more likely to include a smear
  -negative source case (odds ratio (OR) 2.0) or a foreign-born secondary case
  (OR 3.4) and less likely to include a secondary case <15 years old (OR 0.3).
  Our study suggests that contact investigations should focus not only on the
  household but also on all settings frequented by an index case. Foreign-born
  persons with TB may have been infected previously in high-prevalence countries;
  screening and preventive measures recommended by the Institute of Medicine
  could prevent TB reactivation in these cases.

AB: We conducted a population-based study to assess demographic and risk-factor
  correlates for the most frequently occurring Mycobacterium tuberculosis
  genotypes from tuberculosis (TB) patients. The study included all incident,
  culture-positive TB patients from seven sentinel surveillance sites in the
  United States from 1996 to 2000. M. tuberculosis isolates were genotyped by
  IS6110-based restriction fragment length polymorphism and spoligotyping.
  Genotyping was available for 90% of 11,923 TB patients. Overall, 48% of cases
  had isolates that matched those from another patient, including 64% of U.S.
  -born and 35% of foreign-born patients. By logistic regression analysis, risk
  factors for clustering of genotypes were being male, U.S.-born, black,
  homeless, and infected with HIV; having pulmonary disease with cavitations on
  chest radiograph and a sputum smear with acid-fast bacilli; and excessive drug
  or alcohol use. Molecular characterization of TB isolates permitted risk
  correlates for clusters and specific genotypes to be described and provided
  information regarding cluster dynamics over time.

AB: The National Tuberculosis Genotyping and Surveillance Network was
  established in 1996 to perform a 5-year, prospective study of the usefulness of
  genotyping Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates to tuberculosis control
  programs. Seven sentinel sites identified all new cases of tuberculosis,
  collected information on patients and contacts, and obtained patient isolates.
  Seven genotyping laboratories performed DNA fingerprinting analysis by the
  international standard IS6110 method. BioImage Whole Band Analyzer software was
  used to analyze patterns, and distinct patterns were assigned unique
  designations. Isolates with six or fewer bands on IS6110 patterns were also
  spoligotyped. Patient data and genotyping designations were entered in a
  relational database and merged with selected variables from the national
  surveillance database. In two related databases, we compiled the results of
  routine contact investigations and the results of investigations of the
  relationships of patients who had isolates with matching genotypes. We describe
  the methods used in the study.

AB: Expression of genes such as cytokeratin 19 (CK19), cytokeratin 20 (CK20) and
  epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been investigated at mRNA level in
  peripheral blood of carcinoma patients to detect the presence of circulating
  tumor cells (CTC). We performed this study because recent literature emphasizes
  that the importance of CK19, 20 and EGFR mRNAs in CTC as prognostic factors
  remains unclear especially for breast, head and neck and colon cancer patients.
  Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by Southern
  blot hybridization was performed in blood samples from 47 subjects (12
  colorectal, 15 head and neck and 20 breast carcinoma patients), as well as in
  35 healthy donors. The CK19 expression was found in 36/47 patients (9
  colorectal, 9 head and neck and 18 breast cancer), two patients (one affected
  by colorectal and one by head and neck cancer) were positive for CK20 whereas
  EGFR was found expressed in 9 patients (3 colorectal, 5 head and neck and one
  breast cancer). Seven of 35 and 4/35 healthy donors displayed positivity for
  the expression of CK19 and CK20 genes respectively, whereas no EGFR mRNA was
  found in this group. The correlation of the detection of CTC in peripheral
  blood with progression of the disease in a follow-up period of 40 months did
  not show any prognostic value to the presence of mRNAs of these biomarkers in
  blood. We believe that research should be addressed, at least for breast
  cancer, to the identification of occult metastases in sentinel lymph nodes,
  such as recently performed in melanoma patients.

AB: Behavioural serial sentinel surveillance survey for female sex workers
  (FSWs) was carried out in the Government Social Hygiene Clinics in Hong Kong
  during 1999 and 2000. A total of 1366 and 1451 FSWs participated in the
  questionnaire survey respectively. The results showed that the majority of FSWs
  attending the clinics were of Chinese ethnicity (83.8%, 87.6%) while Thai
  (13.0%, 9.4%) and Filipino (2.1%, 2.7%) were the main foreign ethnic groups.
  The karaoke night club was the most frequent reported workplace (32.0%, 32.6%)
  followed by a club (8.9%, 11.7%) and free-lancing (8.6%, 9.0%). The proportion
  of FSWs who always used condoms in vaginal sex with commercial sex partners was
  70.9% and 75.0% respectively (P=0.038). Compared with previous results, a
  rising trend of condom use by FSWs in commercial sex was observed. However,
  there was a relatively low condom use during commercial oral sexual intercourse
  (30.7%, 36.6%) and sex with their regular sex partners in all forms of sexual
  activities. Client dislike is the main attributed factor for not wearing
  condoms. The point prevalence of both infectious syphilis and HIV infection was
  0.1% in both years. These data are useful for planning, resource allocation and
  evaluation of outreach activities and STI services targeting at FSWs and their
  clients. They provide a sampling framework for further surveillance.

AB: Background: The radioisotope technique has been used to identify sentinel
  nodes in patients with breast cancer. However, quantitative analysis of the
  radioactivity for detecting the sentinel nodes was not previously examined. In
  this study, we considered a clinically useful criterion for detecting sentinel
  nodes by a detailed analysis of 312 sentinel nodes using the radioisotope
  technique. Patients and methods: Patients with T1-2, NO breast cancer were
  eligible for this study. The nodes with the highest radioactivity after
  injection of technetium-labeled tin colloids were identified as hot nodes. The
  radioactivities of the hot nodes and the background counts of the axillary
  basin were examined in order to establish new criteria for detecting the
  sentinel nodes. Results: Between May 1997 and December 2001, 312 hot nodes were
  detected in 183 of 186 patients (98.4%). Since the false-negative rate for
  metastasis in hot nodes was only 2.1% (1/48), they could serve as sentinel
  nodes to predict the nodal status. However, there was a wide distribution of
  the hot nodes and the background in terms of absolute counts and a criterion
  for the sentinel nodes could not be established in terms of the absolute
  counts. When we adopted the criterion of sentinel nodes with a gtoreq100 count
  ratio in relation to the background, only 169 hot nodes (54.3%) met our
  definition. When the criterion of a gtoreq10 count ratio was adopted, all hot
  nodes met our definition and all other nodes remained non-sentinel nodes,
  Conclusion: The criterion for defining sentinel nodes in our method is a node
  with a gtoreq10 count ratio with respect to the background. It is recommended
  that an analysis based on such objective data should be investigated in order
  to provide surgeons with more accurate and clinically useful criteria for
  detecting sentinel nodes.

AB: Although nearly 90% of sm cancers of the esophagus show one or more factors
  related to poor prognosis such as ly(+), v(+), n(+), the five-year survival
  rate after D2, 3 esophagectomy is as high as 72.6% (disease specific survival:
  81.8%), which is evidently higher than the figure of 40.2% (59.8%) after D0, 1
  operation. However, there are surely some sm cancers to which local therapy
  such as EMR is curative and some in which chemo-radiotherapy can eradicate
  tumor cells in spite of lymph node involvement. Because the results of such
  organ preserving treatment available now inevitably have selection bias, it can
  not be compared directly to the results of surgical treatment. Sentinel node
  navigation surgery, a charming new concept, still involves many problems to be
  solved both technically and theoretically before its clinical application. The
  standard treatment for sm cancers of the esophagus at present is still
  esophagectomy with standard lymph node dissection. The effort to improve the
  outcome of esophagus preserving treatment and its objective comparison to the
  outcome of surgical treatment is necessary to improve the QOL of the patients.

AB: Suction traps (30 cm diameter) were more effective for non-attractant
  sampling of flying adult Culex tarsalis Coquillett than were smaller CDC (5.5
  cm diameter), Malaise or ramp traps. Comparative catch in suction traps
  operated in a variety of vegetation types indicated that females congregated
  along elevated ecotones and were significantly less abundant flying over low
  vegetation or under and over elevated vegetation. Most females taken at upland
  orchards or Tamarisk tree lines were unfed (97%, n = 5,278) and similar in
  reproductive condition to host-seeking females. Blood fed and gravid females
  and males were only abundant near emergence sites. Pyrocide 7396 (Pyrethrin 5%,
  PBO 25%) was applied at the label rate of 5 oz/min by truck mounted Pro-Mist
  ultra low volume (ULV) equipment and particle drift measured by bioassay. ULV
  particles dispersed well downwind over low vegetation, between citrus orchard
  rows, and under date orchard canopy, but did not penetrate citrus orchards or
  vineyards when rows were perpendicular to wind direction. Particles did move up
  and over vegetation contacting sentinel mosquitoes placed above the canopy. The
  congregation of adult mosquitoes at vegetative ecotones and within orchard
  vegetation may afford protection from ground applied ULV particles, negatively
  impacting control. These data may explain why repeated applications often fail
  to interrupt encephalitis virus transmission.

AB: Under controlled conditions we exposed eggs of 17 potential host taxa
  representing five orders and 14 families to females of Trichogramma platneri
  Nagarkatti, an egg parasitoid used as an inundative biological control agent
  against codling moth, Cydia pomonella L. (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae).
  Trichogramma platneri successfully parasitized species from five lepidopteran
  families (Gelechiidae, Noctuidae, Pyralidae, Sphingidae, Tortricidae) and the
  green lacewing, Chrysoperla carnea Stephens (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae). Female
  wasps spent more time on heavier host eggs and the probability of successful
  parasitism was related to the structural integrity of the chorion of the host
  egg. We observed oviposition attempts on all other lepidopteran hosts offered
  and on eggs of Geocoris punctipes Say (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae) and Nezara
  viridula L. (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae). Dipteran and coleopteran eggs were not
  attacked. Sentinel eggs of the six physiologically acceptable hosts were
  exposed in a walnut orchard in California during inundative releases of T.
  platneri and all hosts were attacked equally. Parasitoids were also equally
  active at all heights from 1.5 to 6.5 m within the orchard canopy. Inundative
  releases of T. platneri may impact naturally occurring populations of green
  lacewings within walnut orchards, and have the potential to impact nontarget
  lepidopteran populations within the release area.

AB: The introduction of a St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLE) genotype new to
  southeastern California during 2000 was followed by focal enzootic
  amplification in the Coachella Valley that was detected by seroconversions of
  29 sentinel chickens in five of nine flocks of 10 chickens each, isolations of
  virus from 30 of 538 pools of 50 Culex tarsalis Coquillett females, and
  collection of 30 positive sera from 2,205 wild birds. This SLE strain over
  wintered successfully and then amplified during the summer of 2001, with 47
  sentinel seroconversions in eight of nine flocks, 70 virus isolations from 719
  pools of Cx. tarsalis and Cx. p. quinquefasciatus Say, and 40 positive sera
  from 847 wild birds. Human illness was not detected by passive case
  surveillance, despite issuance of a health alert during 2001. Virus
  amplification during both years was associated with above average temperatures
  conducive for extrinsic incubation and below average precipitation during
  spring associated with below average vector abundance. Seroconversions by
  sentinel chickens provided the timely detection of virus activity, with initial
  conversions detected before positive mosquito pools or wild bird infections.
  Vertical infection was not detected among Cx. tarsalis adults reared from
  immatures collected during the fall-winter of 2000, even though SLE over
  wintered successfully in this area. Early seroconversions by a sentinel chicken
  during February 2001 and a recaptured Gambel's quaff in April 2001provided
  evidence for transmission during winter and spring when ambient temperatures
  averaged below 17degreeC, the threshold for SLE replication.

AB: In the past decade, the Sultanate of Oman has experienced three outbreaks of
  paralytic poliomyelitis-a widespread polio type 1 epidemic in 1988/1989, four
  cases of polio type 3 in three different regions in 1991, and a localized type
  1 outbreak in 1993. The lessons learnt from each of these epidemics have guided
  us to modify and improve our polio eradication activities. Currently, these
  activities include administration of five primary and three booster doses of
  trivalent oral polio vaccine, yearly national immunization campaigns (NIDs)
  since 1995 with coverage of >90%, localized immunization campaigns, acute
  flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance which involves reporting of all cases by
  facsimile to the Department of Surveillance within 24 h of detecting a case and
  weekly zero reporting from 22 sentinel sites, and virological testing of stool
  specimens of all AFP cases and their close contacts at the national, World
  Health Organization accredited laboratory. The cumulative success of these
  activities has resulted in Oman being free from polio for the past 6 years.
  However, the possibility of importation of wild poliovirus, particularly from
  southern and western Asia still exists.

  from the distal mask (backplate). No sequelae resulted from failure of the
  airway apparatus. The LMA was examined by LMA North America, and the company
  stated "no definitive explanation can be made to explain the cause for
  separation of the airway from the backplate." Conclusion: Although the use of
  the LMA is associated with rare and minimal complications, each airway should
  be carefully inspected before its use for loss of integrity resulting from
  sterilization or for defects in manufacturing.

AB: Objective: To assess the feasibility and accuracy of sentinel lymph node
  biopsy (SLNB) in breast cancer. Methods: Thirty-three cases of stage T1-2, N0-1
  abreast cancer were enrolled. After radiolabeled material (99mTc-DX) were
  injected intracutaneously surrounding the primary tumor or adjacent to the
  biopsy scar, the sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) were identified by
  lymphoscintigraphy and labeled on skin of body. At surgery, using the hand-held
  gamma probe, the radiolabeled axillary lymph nodes (included SLN) could be
  detected and SLNB were performed before the radical/modified mastectomy. The
  radioactive content and histopathology of the individual lymph node harvested
  during each procedure were analyzed. Results: Combining lymphoscintigraphy and
  gamma probe, the detection rate was 96.9%, sensitivity was 90.9%, false
  negative was 9.1% and false positive was 0. Conclusion: SLNB has an important
  value for the treatment of breast cancer in clinic. It almost has not any
  injury and has a high accuracy and sensitivity in prediction of axillary lymph
  nodes metastasis.

AB: Dendritic cells (DCs) are bone-marrow derived 'professional' antigen
  presenting cells (APC). They are considered as the most potent APC able to
  induce primary immune responses. DC efficiently capture and process proteic and
  non-proteic antigens. They are widely distributed throughout the body and
  occupy sentinel positions such as epithelia. Establishment of an immune
  response against cancer may depend of the capacity of DCs to transfer (to
  capture, to process and to present) tumor antigens into regional lymph nodes
  where they can induce a specific response leading to tumor rejection. Because
  host 'professional' DCs are one of the most important elements in the induction
  of specific anti-tumor responses and lymph nodes are the places where the
  immune response takes place, we investigated the densities of DCs within
  regional metastasis-free lymph nodes from 47 patients with different malignant
  epithelial tumors as comparing with lymph nodes from 11 patients without
  malignancies using an immunohistochemistry method with anti-S100 protein, CD86
  and CD1a antibodies. By means of morphometric analysis, we observed that S100+
  and CD1a+DCs densities in regional lymph nodes from cancer patients were
  significatively decreased as compared with control lymph nodes (P<0.0001 and
  0.003, respectively). S100+DCs and CD86+DCs densities in lymph nodes draining
  cancer were similar. Taken together, these data indicated that lymph nodes
  draining cancer had significantly less CD1a+DCs than S100+ and possibly
  CD86+DCs. These findings may represent another mechanism by which tumors evade
  the immune recognition.

AB: Background: The impact of regional therapy on survival of patients with
  invasive breast cancer remains controversial. Regional therapies discussed
  include axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), internal mammary node
  dissection, and locoregional radiotherapy. Methods: Prospective randomized
  clinical studies of regional therapy were reviewed using, as a source, Medline,
  main review articles on the related topic, and statements from consensus
  conference. Results: Although a number of randomized clinical studies have
  failed to demonstrate the benefits of regional treatment for survival, it is
  still a matter of debate whether ALND or regional radiotherapy alone can have a
  small but significant beneficial effect on the survival of breast cancer
  patients. However, recent studies have suggested that survival can be enhanced
  by interaction of postmastectomy locoregional radiotherapy with adjuvant
  systemic therapy. Conclusions: Locoregional control is important for enhancing
  survival in the presence of adjuvant systemic therapy. Although only a few
  randomized controlled trials show conclusively the survival benefit of local
  therapies, it is expected that in clinical practice, the node-positive or other
  high-risk breast cancer patients given systemic treatment will be more
  frequently treated with postmastectomy radiation.

AB: There are few data about the reliability of sentinel node biopsy in patients
  with multi-focal breast cancer. The aim of this study was to determine the
  factors affecting the identification and accuracy of the sentinel node,
  comparing multifocality with other variables, using peritumoral isosulfan blue
  dye injection technique alone. Between 1998 and 2001, 122 patients with
  clinically negative nodes from a single institute were eligible for sentinel
  lymph node biopsies (SLNBs). All patients underwent conventional axillary lymph
  node dissection (ALND). SLNs were identified in 111 of 122 (91%) cases, and
  analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin. Twenty-one patients with multifocal breast
  cancer were determined by clinical or pathologic examination (gross or
  microscopic). Success in locating the sentinel node was unrelated to patient's
  age, tumor size, type, location, histological or nuclear grade, multifocality,
  or a previous surgical biopsy. SLNBs accurately predicted the status of the
  axilla in 104 of the 111 patients (93.7%), while 18 of the 21 patients with
  multi-focal breast cancer (85.7%) had successful lymphatic mapping. The false
  negative (FN) rate was 11.3% among patients with successful SLNBs.
  Multifocality and tumor size (>2 cm) were associated significantly with
  decreased accuracy and increased FN rates (for multifocality, p=0.007 and
  p=0.006, and for tumor size >2 cm, p=0.04 and p=0.05, respectively) in binary
  logistic regression analysis, whereas excisional biopsy, tumor location in the
  upper outer quadrant and patient's age did not significantly affect the
  accuracy and FN rates in univariate analysis. These results suggest sentinel
  lymph node biopsy using peritumoral isosulfan blue injection method alone can
  accurately predict axillary status in patients with clinically negative nodes,
  but patients with multi-focal disease and large tumor size may not be ideal
  candidates.

AB: Following the introduction of automobile catalysts in the middle of the
  Eighties in Germany there is an increasing emission of the platinum-group
  -metals (PGM) platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd) and rhodium (Rh). Still, it remains
  unclear if these metals are bioavailable for aquatic animals and to which
  extent they accumulate in the aquatic biosphere. Zebra mussels (Dreissena
  polymorpha) were maintained in water containing road dust at a concentration of
  1 kg/101. Following an exposure period of 26 weeks, soft tissues of the mussels
  were analysed applying adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry (ACSV) for the
  determination of Pt and Rh and total-reflection X-ray fluorescence analysis
  after co-precipitation of Pd with mercury. This experiment revealed for the
  first time that all the three catalyst emitted metals were accumulated by
  mussels. The bioaccumulation increased in the following manner: Rh<Pt<Pd. Thus,
  the application of sentinel organisms in combination with modern trace
  analytical procedures in environmental impact studies does allow an assessment
  of the distribution and the degree of bioaccumulation of PGM in the
  environment, which is highly appreciated.

AB: It recently became clear that acanthocephalans parasitizing mammals can
  bioconcentrate several heavy metals to conspicuously higher concentrations than
  the tissues of their definitive hosts. As cestodes are more abundant in
  terrestrial animals than acanthocephalans, and thus potentially more useful in
  attempts toward passive as well as active biomonitoring, a very common tapeworm
  and its synanthropic mammalian host were selected for the present study. The
  tapeworm Hymenolepis diminuta and experimentally infected male Wistar rats of
  the CD-M-strain were investigated with respect to their lead accumulation. The
  worms were allowed to grow up for five weeks post infection followed by a five
  weeks oral lead exposure of the rats. After the exposure period the rats were
  killed and the metal levels were determined in muscle, liver, intestine, testes
  and kidney of the rats as well as in the parasites. Lead concentrations were
  found to be 17 times higher in the cestodes than in kidney, whereas metal
  levels in all other host tissues were below the detection limit. Thus, this
  study reveals that lead accumulation also occurs in cestodes parasitizing
  mammals. Due to a lack of adequate sentinel species in terrestrial habitats the
  host-parasite-system rat-H. diminuta appears to be a useful and promising
  bioindication system especially in urban ecosystems.

AB: Background: The increasing utilization of lymphatic mapping techniques for
  breast carcinoma has made intraoperative evaluation of sentinel lymph nodes
  attractive. Axillary lymph node dissection can be performed during the initial
  surgery if the sentinel lymph node is positive, potentially avoiding a second
  operative procedure. At present the optimal technique for rapid sentinel lymph
  node assessment has not been determined. Both frozen sectioning and
  intraoperative imprint cytology are used for rapid intraoperative sentinel
  lymph node evaluation at many institutions. The purpose of this study is to
  evaluate experience with imprint cytology for intraoperative evaluation of
  sentinel lymph nodes in patients with breast cancer. Methods: A retrospective
  review of the intraoperative imprint cytology results of 678 sentinel lymph
  node mappings for breast carcinoma was performed. Sentinel nodes were evaluated
  intraoperatively by either bisecting or slicing the sentinel node into 4 mm
  sections. Imprints were made of each cut surface and stained with H&E and/or
  Diff-Quik. Permanent sections were evaluated with up to four H&E stained levels
  and cytokeratin immunohistochemistry. Intraoperative imprint cytology results
  were compared with final histologic results. Results: The sensitivity of
  imprint cytology was 53%, specificity was 98%, positive predictive value was
  94%, negative predictive value was 82% and accuracy was 84%. The sensitivity
  for detecting macrometastases (more than 2mm) was significantly better than for
  detecting micrometastases (ltoreq2 mm), 81 versus 21%, respectively (P<00001).
  Conclusions: The sensitivity and specificity of imprint cytology are similar to
  that of intraoperative frozen section evaluation. Imprint cytology is therefore
  a viable alternative to frozen sectioning when intraoperative evaluation is
  required. If sentinel lymph node micrometastasis is used to determine the need
  for further lymphadenectomy, more sensitive intraoperative methods will be
  needed to avoid a second operation.

AB: We sought to define the pathogenic mutation in a family with hypertrophic
  cardiomyopathy (HC) and a markedly arrhythmogenic phenotype. The proband was an
  8-year-old female with a sentinel event of sudden death. Screening
  echocardiograms revealed HC in 2 of her 3 siblings and her father. Her youngest
  male sibling was diagnosed with HC at age 2 1/2 years and died suddenly at age
  6 years from ventricular fibrillation despite an implanted cardioverter
  defibrillator. Using DNA extracted from peripheral lymphocytes, linkage
  exclusion was performed by haplotype analysis of polymorphic markers for the HC
  genes. Genes not excluded by linkage were analyzed for mutations using
  denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and direct DNA
  sequencing. Using this strategy, a 610 T>G nucleotide substitution in the alpha
  -tropomyosin gene (TPM1) was identified resulting in a novel L185R (Leucine (L)
  to Arginine (R)) missense mutation. This mutation was a spontaneous germ-line
  mutation originating in the proband's father. L185R-TPM1 cosegregated with
  family members having clinical evidence of HC, including the proband as
  confirmed by molecular autopsy. The mutation was not present in 400 reference
  alleles. Thus, a novel missense mutation in TPM1 was discovered in a family
  with HC and sudden death in childhood. Unlike previously defined mutations that
  may disrupt the interactions between alpha-tropomyosin monomers, the L185R
  mutation may affect troponin-T binding. Defining the pathogenic mutation
  enabled definitive molecular diagnosis of 2 surviving children.

AB: Lung cancer is the most frequent cause of cancer death in the United States.
  The pattern of regional lymph node involvement is a major prognostic factor in
  a patient with nonsmall cell lung cancer. The accuracy of information obtained
  about the lymph node status of lung cancer patients can be potentially
  increased by sentinel node lymphatic mapping. This technique has been well
  studied in melanoma and breast cancer. It may be useful in increasing the
  detection of micrometastases and in decreasing the morbidity from complete
  mediastinal lymphadenectomy. We report an animal pilot study of pulmonary
  lymphatic mapping. The aim of our study was to gain experience in the surgical
  techniques for pulmonary sentinel node lymphatic mapping in an animal model
  prior to its application in humans. Technetium sulfur colloid and isosulfan
  blue dye were injected into different lobes of the lung followed by attempts to
  identify the sentinel node draining that specific portion of the lung.
  Technetium sulfur colloid identified the sentinel node in five of six dogs
  within 20 min after the radiotracer was injected into the lung parenchyma.
  Isosulfan blue dye identified the sentinel node in three of six dogs within 5
  min. Both the agents are potentially useful, but we found greater technical
  ease in identifying the sentinel node with technetium sulfur colloid. Two
  single-institution pilot studies in humans have been performed. A multi
  -centered study to validate and further refine this technique is necessary.
  Advanced pathologic techniques such as immunohistochemistry and reverse
  transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction can be used to enhance the accuracy of
  staging. This may facilitate proper application of novel therapeutic strategies
  to improve the current dismal prognosis of this disease.

AB: Background: Public health authorities want to evaluate their sexually
  transmitted disease (STD) surveillance systems to promote the most effective
  use of health resources. Goal: The goal of this study was to estimate the
  sensitivity of national laboratory reports of Chlamydia trachomatis in
  Switzerland (the proportion of cases detected by national laboratory reports).
  Study Design: A cross sectional prevalence study was conducted by the Swiss
  Sentinel Surveillance Network of Gynecologists in 1998. Two groups of women
  aged less than 35 years were included in the study: those having a first
  consultation for pregnancy and those having a routine check-up. Results: A
  total of 1589 women were tested for C. trachomatis. The prevalence among
  pregnant women (n=817) was 1.3%, and that among sexually active women (n=772)
  was 2.8%. Using the prevalences observed among check-up women, we estimate that
  there were at least 24,400 C. trachomatis infections in Switzerland among women
  aged 20 to 34 years in 1998 (95% CI: 14,300-34,300). The number of laboratory
  reports of C. trachomatis in this age group was 1150 in 1998. Conclusion: Our
  study suggests that the sensitivity of national laboratory reports of C.
  trachomatis in 1998 was less than 5% for women aged 20 to 34 years.

AB: Travelers have the potential both to acquire and to spread dengue virus
  infection. The incidence of dengue fever (DF) among European travelers
  certainly is underestimated, because few centers use standardized diagnostic
  procedures for febrile patients. In addition, DF is currently not reported in
  most European public health systems. Surveillance has commenced within the
  framework of a European Network on Imported Infectious Disease Surveillance
  (TropNetEurop) to gain information on the quantity and severity of cases of
  dengue imported into Europe. Descriptions of 294 patients with DF were analyzed
  for epidemiological information and clinical features. By far the most
  infections were imported from Asia, which suggests a high risk of DF for
  travelers to that region. Dengue hemorrhagic fever occurred in 7 patients
  (2.4%) all of whom recovered. Data reported by member sites of the TropNetEurop
  can contribute to understanding the epidemiology and clinical characteristics
  of imported DF.

AB: Staphylococcus aureus is a common pathogen responsible for nosocomial and
  community infections. It readily colonizes indwelling catheters, forming
  microbiotic communities termed biofilms. S. aureus bacteria in biofilms are
  protected from killing by antibiotics and the body's immune system. For years,
  one mechanism behind biofilm resistance to attack from the immune system's
  sentinel leukocytes has been conceptualized as a deficiency in the ability of
  the leukocytes to penetrate the biofilm. We demonstrate here that under
  conditions mimicking physiological shear, leukocytes attach, penetrate, and
  produce cytokines in response to maturing and fully matured S. aureus biofilm.

AB: Although vaccination campaigns have significantly reduced the number of
  measles cases worldwide, endemic transmission of measles virus (MV) continues
  to occur in several continents, including Europe. To obtain current information
  on measles incidence and molecular data on circulating MVs in Germany, a
  nationwide measles sentinel was established. Phylogenetic analysis based on the
  variable part of the N gene from 80 MVs isolated between November 1999 and
  October 2001 revealed the presence of at least six distinct MV genotypes: B3,
  C2, D4, D6, G2 and a new variant of D7. Both the incidence and the pattern of
  MV genotypes differed markedly between the former East and West Germany. In the
  eastern part, few measles cases, mainly caused by genotypes originating from
  other countries (B3, D4, G2), were detected. In the western and southern parts,
  genotypes C2, D6 and D7 were associated with endemic transmission.
  Surprisingly, the indigenous genotypes predominant during the 1990s - C2 and D6
  - disappeared simultaneously over the period of observation coinciding with the
  emergence and the wide spread of D7 viruses. While the incidence of measles
  remained constant, all MVs isolated in 2001 were assigned to D7. We note that
  the haemagglutinin (H) sequence of D7 viruses shows distinct exchanges of
  certain amino acids in the stem and propeller domain compared to C2, D6 and the
  MV vaccine strains used. This raises the possibility of a selective advantage
  of D7 viruses transmitted in the presence of H-specific antibodies.

AB: Objective: To determine factors independently associated with the
  acquisition of a ciprofloxacin-resistant Campylobacter jejuni infection.
  Methods: Self-completion questionnaires were used to collect clinical,
  demographic and exposure data from cases of campylobacter infection reported to
  a sentinel surveillance scheme in England and Wales. Isolates from those cases
  were referred to the Public Health Laboratory Service Campylobacter Reference
  Unit for speciation, subtyping and antimicrobial resistance testing. Cases
  infected with a ciprofloxacin-resistant C. jejuni were compared with cases
  infected with a sensitive strain using case-case analysis. Single risk variable
  analysis and logistic regression analysis were employed. The analysis was
  restricted by travel status to control for the confounding effect of foreign
  travel. Results and conclusion: Over half (55%) of the campylobacter infections
  acquired abroad were resistant to ciprofloxacin, compared with 10% of UK
  -acquired strains (relative risk 5.23; 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.58-5.96).
  For travel-associated cases, ciprofloxacin-resistant infections were
  independently associated with travel to Spain (odds ratio (OR) 6.87; 95% CI
  3.52-13.38), Portugal (OR 22.40; 95% CI 4.36-114.99) or Cyprus (OR 11.74; 95%
  CI 1.28-108.02), and the consumption of chicken (OR 4.95; 95% CI 2.12-11.56) or
  bottled water (OR 3.70; 95% CI 1.69-8.10). Indigenous cases infected with a
  ciprofloxacin-resistant strain were more likely to report the consumption of
  pre-cooked cold meats (OR 2.13; 95% CI 1.44-3.13). The risk of acquiring a
  ciprofloxacin-resistant campylobacter infection was strongly associated with
  foreign travel. Restricting the analyses by travel status revealed different
  sets of risk exposures for acquiring a resistant C. jejuni strain, suggesting
  that different intervention strategies will be required.

AB: Up to now, no reliable methods for the pre- or intraoperative prediction of
  the nodal status are available in gastrointestinal cancer patients. Therefore,
  after the successful application of the sentinel lymph node concept in melanoma
  and breast cancer, ongoing research on this field is extended to
  gastrointestinal tumor entities. According to recent experiences, the most
  promising tumor entities are colon, gastric and anal cancer. First results with
  these patients indicate that the method could be a reliable predictor of the
  nodal status and, thus, may have important future implications for adjuvant
  therapy and the extent of surgery. The dye method for colon cancer and the
  combined method (dye and radiocolloid) for gastric cancer seem to be
  appropriate approaches, even when the general experience is still low. In
  rectal cancer, however, current experience failed yet to yield satisfying
  results. Up to now, anal cancer has not been a focus of publication, even when
  the concept seems to be very attractive for the evaluation of the inguinal
  lymph node status.

AB: Advances in surgical tumor therapy are founded on a very close interaction
  between different surgical subspecialties as well as the inclusion of surgical
  into modern multimodality treatment concepts. The ongoing development of
  surgical techniques, e.g. microsurgical flap transfers or pouch reconstructions
  of intestinal reservoirs, has increasingly enabled organ- and function
  -preserving surgery. In addition, new materials (e.g. modular tumor
  endoprosthesis) has supported this development. The broad application of the
  sentinel node technique in melanoma and breast cancer and also in
  gastrointestinal tract cancers opens new concepts of diagnosis and therapy for
  lymphatic metastasized tumors. Locally advanced tumors can be treated in
  neoadjuvant protocols to increase the resectability rate and the probability
  for local control as a prerequisite for long-term survival. Especially for
  metastatic disease, interventional treatment techniques such as laser-induced
  thermotherapy (LITT) or photodynamic therapy have added valuable options to
  surgical treatment.

AB: Location of the sentinel lymph node in malignant melanoma and early breast
  cancer patients requires separate injections of radiocolloid and blue dye.
  These agents are administered at alternative times because of their different
  rates of transit. This study has elucidated why particular dyes are absorbed by
  the lymphatic system from an investigation of dye molecular structure as a
  function of protein binding ability. Methods: A dyeprotein binding assay was
  developed using size-exclusion chromatography and ultraviolet spectrophotometry
  and applied to a series of 20 sulfonic acid group-containing dyes.
  Radiochemical analyses were also used with 3 99mTc-labeled dyes to rationalize
  which functional groups are involved in the protein binding reaction. Results:
  Methylene blue resulted in no protein affinity at 37degreeC, whereas
  disulfonate dyes separated by 1 atom such as Patent blue or Indigo carmine gave
  <30% binding. Optimum protein binding (84%-100%) was achieved with those dyes
  containing at least 2 sulfonic acid groups separated by 2-6 atoms in their
  chemical structure. Seven symmetric tetrasulfonic acid azo dyes were examined,
  including Evans blue, to result in 59%-71% binding. Conclusion: Ionizable
  groups (sulfonic acids) that are present in the structure of dyes are directly
  involved in dye-protein binding. At the molecular level, there is a sulfonation
  reaction between sulfonic acid dyes and amino groups on the protein surface to
  form sulfonamide complexes. This reaction shows how the soluble dyes Evans blue
  and Patent blue are trapped in lymph after subdermal injection during the
  sentinel node biopsy procedure.

AB: Factors that affect the resistance rates for an organism-drug combination in
  a given hospital also might influence resistance rates for other organism-drug
  combinations. We examined correlations between resistance prevalence in non
  -intensive care inpatient areas of 41 hospitals participating in phase 3 (1998
  -1999) of Project ICARE (Intensive Care Antimicrobial Resistance Epidemiology).
  We focused on statistically significant (P<.05) Pearson correlation
  coefficients for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase
  -negative staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and resistance to
  third-generation cephalosporins, imipenem, and fluoroquinolones in Escherichia
  coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
  Resistance prevalence rates in individual hospitals were not strongly
  correlated among gram-positive organisms, and few correlations were seen
  between rates in gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. More frequent
  significant associations were found among resistance rates for gram-negative
  organisms. Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in K. pneumoniae was
  significantly correlated with the majority of other sentinel antimicrobial
  -resistant organisms. High prevalence of this organism may serve as a marker
  for more generalized resistance problems in hospital inpatient areas.

AB: The elimination of seropositive dogs in Brazil has been used to control
  zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis but with little success. To elucidate the
  reasons for this, the infectiousness of 50 sentinel dogs exposed to natural
  Leishmania chagasi infection was assessed through time by xenodiagnosis with
  the sandfly vector, Lutzomyia longipalpis. Eighteen (43%) of 42 infected dogs
  became infectious after a median of 333 days in the field (105 days after
  seroconversion). Seven highly infectious dogs (17%) accounted for >80% of
  sandfly infections. There were positive correlations between infectiousness and
  anti-Leishmania immunoglobulin G, parasite detection by polymerase chain
  reaction, and clinical disease (logistic regression, r2=0.08-0.18). The
  sensitivity of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect currently infectious
  dogs was high (96%) but lower in the latent period (<63%), and specificity was
  low (24%). Mathematical modeling suggests that culling programs fail because of
  high incidence of infection and infectiousness, the insensitivity of the
  diagnostic test to detect infectious dogs, and time delays between diagnosis
  and culling.

AB: Elimination of an enzootic infection of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) from a
  large population of genetically engineered mice was accomplished by selecting
  seropositive, non-infective breeders for a newly restored MHV-free breeding
  colony. An ELISA was used to test for the presence of MHV-specific antibody,
  and TaqMan reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis
  was used to detect MHV in the feces. After 10 weeks of intentional exposure,
  approximately 30% of mice with MHV antibodies continued to shed MHV in the
  feces. A natural transmission study was conducted to validate that positive
  fecal RT-PCR results indicated presence of infective virus. Sentinel results
  from the re-instituted breeding colony indicated that MHV was successfully
  eliminated by use of RT-PCR analysis for selection of non-infective mice.

AB: BACKGROUND. Sentinel lymph node examination in patients with breast
  carcinoma has been gaining in popularity. Currently, there is no standard
  intraoperative assessment of sentinel lymph nodes. To assess the utility of an
  intraoperative touch imprint (TI) evaluation, the authors compared TI cytology
  with surface hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) histology in sentinel lymph nodes from
  patients with breast carcinoma. METHODS. Sixty five sentinel lymph node biopsy
  cases were identified. Diagnoses from TI and surface H&E histologic sections
  were compared. RESULTS. Touch imprint had a specificity of 100%, a negative
  predictive value of 88%, a sensitivity of 65%, and a false negative rate of 9%
  per sentinel lymph node biopsy case. Eighty three percent of the false negative
  TI cases were due to micrometastasis. Preoperative chemotherapy, primary tumor
  type, and primary tumor size did not significantly contribute to false negative
  events. Touch imprint identified 67% of the cases that required completion
  axillary dissection. CONCLUSIONS. Touch imprint is a reliable and accurate
  intraoperative technique, with the potential to save a significant number of
  patients morbidity and the cost of a second surgical procedure to remove
  axillary lymph nodes. The difficulty of identifying micrometastases appeared to
  be the major source of false negative events, a problem that is not unique to
  TI cytology.

AB: Neck lymph node status is the most important factor for prognosis in head
  and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Sentinel node detection reliably predicts the
  lymph node status in melanoma and breast cancer patients. This study evaluates
  the predictive value of sentinel node detection in 50 patients suffering from
  pharyngeal and laryngeal carcinomas with a N0 neck as assessed by ultrasound
  imaging. Following 99m-Technetium nanocolloid injection in the perimeter of the
  tumour intraoperative sentinel node detection was performed during lymph node
  dissection. Postoperatively the histological results of the sentinel nodes were
  compared with the excised neck dissection specimen. Identification of sentinel
  nodes was successful in all 50 patients with a sensitivity of 89%. In eight
  cases the sentinel node showed nodal disease (pN1). In 41 patients the sentinel
  node was tumour negative reflecting the correct neck lymph node status (pN0).
  We observed one false-negative result. In this case the sentinel node was free
  of tumour, whereas a neighbouring lymph node contained a lymph node metastasis
  (pN1). Although we have shown, that skipping of nodal basins can occur, this
  technique still reliably identifies the sentinel nodes of patients with
  squamous cell carcinoma of the pharynx and larynx. Future studies must show, if
  sentinel node detection is suitable to limit the extent of lymph node
  dissection in clinically N0 necks of patients suffering from pharyngeal and
  laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.

AB: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of lymphatic
  drainage to non-axillary sentinel nodes and to determine the implications of
  this phenomenon. A total of 549 breast cancer patients underwent
  lymphoscintigraphy after intratumoural injection of 99mTc-nanocolloid. The
  sentinel node was intraoperatively identified with the aid of intratumoural
  administered patent blue dye and a gamma-ray detection probe. Histopathological
  examination of sentinel nodes included step-sectioning at six levels and
  immunohistochemical staining. A sentinel node outside level I or II of the
  axilla was found in 149 patients (27%): internal mammary sentinel nodes in 86
  patients, other non-axillary sentinel nodes in 44 and both internal mammary and
  other non-axillary sentinel nodes in nineteen patients. The intra-operative
  identification rate was 80%. Internal mammary metastases were found in
  seventeen patients and metastases in other non-axillary sentinel nodes in ten
  patients. Staging improved in 13% of patients with non-axillary sentinel lymph
  nodes and their treatment strategy was changed in 17%. A small proportion of
  clinically node negative breast cancer patients can be staged more precisely by
  biopsy of sentinel nodes outside level I and II of the axilla, resulting in
  additional decision criteria for postoperative regional or systemic therapy.

AB: Axillary lymph node involvement is the best prognostic factor for breast
  cancer survival. Staging breast cancers by axillary dissection remains standard
  management and is part of the UK national guidelines for breast cancer
  treatment. In the presence of involved axillary lymph nodes best treatment has
  been shown to be axillary clearance (Fentiman and Mansell, 1991), but clearly
  for women whose nodes are uninvolved avoidance of morbidity is optimal and this
  will be achieved by minimal dissection of the axilla. Thus, for node-negative
  women the introduction of the sentinel node biopsy technique may revolutionise
  the approach to the axilla. These will be women with mammographic screen
  detected small well and moderately differentiated tumours (Hadjiloucas and
  Bundred, 2000). The impact of sentinel node biopsy in women who have
  symptomatic large tumours is unproven, and around half of these women will
  require a second procedure to clear their axilla or radiotherapy as treatment.
  Even for those women found to have involved sentinel lymph nodes the ability to
  use early systemic chemotherapy followed by axillary clearance or radiotherapy
  may provide long-term survival gains. Sentinel node biopsy should not, however,
  become routine practice until randomised controlled trials have proven its
  benefit and safety in reducing morbidity. Several randomised controlled trials
  (including ALMANAC) are currently underway.

AB: Background: Many infectious disease outbreaks, including those caused by
  intentional attacks, may first present insidiously as ill-defined syndromes or
  unexplained deaths. While there is no substitute for the astute healthcare
  provider or laboratorian alerting the health department of unusual patient
  presentations, suspicious patterns may be apparent at the community level well
  before patient-level data raise an alarm. Methods: Through centralized
  Department of Defense medical information systems, diagnoses based on
  International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification
  (ICD-9-CM) codes are obtained daily from 99 military emergency rooms and
  primary care clinics across the Washington, DC, region. Similar codes are
  grouped together in seven diagnostic clusters that represent related presenting
  signs, symptoms, and diagnoses. Daily monitoring of the data is conducted and
  evaluated for variation from comparable historic patterns for all seven
  syndrome groups. Geospatial mapping and trend analysis are performed using
  geographic information systems software. Data were received on a daily basis
  beginning in December 1999 and collection continues. The data cut-off date for
  this manuscript was January 2002. Results: Demographic breakdown of military
  beneficiaries covered by the surveillance area reveals a broad age, gender, and
  geographic distribution that is generalizable to the Washington DC region.
  Ongoing surveillance for the previous 2 years demonstrates expected
  fluctuations for day-of-the-week and seasonal variations. Detection of several
  natural disease outbreaks are discussed as well as an analysis of retrospective
  data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's sentinel physicians
  -surveillance network during the influenza season that revealed a significantly
  similar curve to the percentage of patients coded with a respiratory illness in
  this new surveillance system. Discussion: We believe that this surveillance
  system can provide early detection of disease outbreaks such as influenza and
  possibly intentional acts. Early detection should enable officials to quickly
  focus limited public health resources, decrease subsequent mortality, and
  improve risk communication. The system is simple, flexible, and, perhaps most
  critical, acceptable to providers in that it puts no additional requirements on
  them.

AB: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) analysis allows the detection of occult metastases
  in patients with melanoma. The use of serial sections and immunohistochemical
  investigations (ICH) increases the chance of identifying metastases.
  Nevertheless, detection of mRNA of the tyrosinase gene through reverse
  transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most sensitive tool for
  detection of occult melanoma cells in SLN. From September 1999 to August 2001,
  in the Anatomic Pathology Unit of M. Bufalini Hospital of Cesena, 489 SLNs from
  332 patients with primary melanoma in clinical stages I and II (according to
  AJCC) were examined. There were 66 (13.5%) SLNs and 58 (17.4%) cases with
  metastasis revealed by histology and ICH. A single case with metastatic SLN was
  found in patients with melanomas ltoreq1 mm in thickness. The percentage of
  cases with metastases in SLN correlated with thickness of the primary melanoma
  (p<0.0001). RT-PCR for tyrosinase was carried out in 448 SLNs from of 308
  cases. Overall, the RT-PCR results were positive in 149 (48.4%) patients and in
  169 SLNs (37.9%). RT-PCR results showed a strong positive correlation with
  tumor thickness of primary melanoma (p<0.0001) and with the clinical stage
  (p<0.0001). Of the RT-PCR-positive cases, 18 showed intracapsular aggregates of
  nevus cells. Besides the percentage of positive cases, once those with nevus
  aggregates were excluded, overall, the RT-PCR revealed the presence of
  tyrosinase mRNA in 34.5% of patients with negative histology and ICH. Ongoing
  monitoring is necessary to define the real prognostic implication of the
  presumed presence of occult melanoma deposits disclosed by RT-PCR in SLNs.

AB: In order to reduce losses caused by Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory
  Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) infection, a method of segregated early weaning (SEW)
  and depopulation of the fattening unit was applied in a reproductive farm with
  a breeding stock consisting of 300 sows. In August 2000 PRRSV infection was
  serologically diagnosed. Moreover, production in this farm was found to be
  negatively affected by this infection. An elimination of a pig subpopulation
  sensitive to PRRSV infection and the extensive cleaning and disinfection
  program of animal facilities was applied with the aim of limiting PRRSV
  infectious pressure within the herd. In the period from 24th December 2000 to
  8th January 2001 inseminations of sows were stopped. Beginning from 24th
  February all piglets after weaning (at the age of 21 days) were moved to
  distant farm facilities. The herd was constantly serologically monitored and
  production results were analyzed until October 2001. After 30 months the
  production results of the herd returned to the levelfrom before the PRRS
  outbreak. The serological results showed that all sows seroconverted. To check
  whether any of the animals of the herd were shedding PRRSV, on 30th August 2001
  ten sentinel gilts unexposed to PRRSV were introduced and allowed to move
  freely within all groups. Results of serum examination of the sentinels after
  two months did not show any signs of their seroconversion. But after the
  following 45 days all of the sentinels seroconverted. This experiment
  demonstrated that SEW and significant depopulation of fattening units is a good
  PRRS control method able to return production results back to normal after one
  year from the beginning of the outbreak. It should be stressed that this method
  is not able to eliminate the infectious virus from the herd during this time.

AB: Increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been
  associated with increased lymph node metastases. The aim of this work was to
  determine whether VEGF-induced hyperpermeability affects peritumor interstitial
  convection and lymphatic drain, thus linking this growth factor with lymphatic
  function. Noninvasive imaging of lymphatic function induced by vascular
  hyperpermeability was achieved by following the distribution of albumin triple
  -labeled with biotin, fluorescein, and gadolinium-diethylene triamine
  pentaacetic acid. This contrast material allowed for multimodality imaging
  using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), confocal microscopy, and histology.
  Overexpression of VEGF in C6-pTET-VEGF165 tumors, inoculated in hind limbs of
  nude mice, elevated vascular permeability, interstitial convection, and
  lymphatic drain. These were manifested in dynamic MRI measurements by outward
  flux of the contrast material, the rate of which correlated with tumor volume
  followed by directional flow toward the popliteal lymph node. Avidin-chase,
  namely i.v. administration of avidin, was applied for inducing rapid clearance
  of the intravascular biotinylated contrast material, thus allowing early
  experimental separation between vascular leak and lymphatic drain. Repeated MRI
  measurements of the same mice were conducted 48 h after withdrawal of VEGF by
  addition of tetracycline to the drinking water. VEGF withdrawal decreased tumor
  blood-plasma volume fraction by 43%, reduced tumor permeability by 75%, and
  abolished interstitial convection of the contrast material. Histological
  sections and whole-mount confocal microscopy confirmed VEGF-induced changes in
  permeability and interstitial accumulation of the contrast material, as well as
  uptake of the contrast material into peritumor lymphatic vessels. These results
  revealed a direct link between expression of VEGF165 and peritumor lymphatic
  drain, thus suggesting a possible role for tumor-derived VEGF in metastatic
  spread to sentinel lymph nodes.

AB: The purpose of our study was to verify in animals the possibility of using
  albumin-enhanced ultrasonography as a modality for sentinel node detection. The
  nine pigs were injected subcutaneously in the neck with albumin, five with 5%
  solution and four with 25% solution, and then the regional lymph nodes were
  observed over time. It was found that, where the 5% solution had been injected,
  the lymph nodes showed no change, but where the 25% solution had been used, a
  high echo 1 to 5 mm in size was seen at the hilus of the nearest lymph node.
  Examination of the excised pathologic specimens of lymph nodes demonstrated
  that this echo was due to albumin accumulated in the efferent lymphatics. This
  finding suggested that this technique of ultrasonography using albumin as a
  contrast agent was an effective new method of identifying sentinel nodes.

AB: Intraoperative lymphatic mapping with identification of the first draining
  lymph node (sentinel node) is under investigation as a possible sole axillary
  staging procedure in breast cancer patients. The role of sentinel node biopsy
  in the district general hospital breast unit is currently unclear. We report a
  series of 122 patients undergoing sentinel node biopsy, using a blue dye
  technique. The sentinel node was identified in 113 patients, and accurately
  predicted the status of the axilla in 108 patients (96%). Of 39 patients who
  were node positive, the sentinel node was the only positive node in 11 cases
  (26%). There were five false negatives in patients who had a node-positive
  axilla. We therefore suggest that sentinel node biopsy may be a feasible
  alternative to formal axillary dissection in certain patients, and that lack of
  access to radioisotope facilities in a district general hospital need not
  preclude such an approach.

AB: Purpose: We characterized early metastatic progression of bladder carcinoma
  from the primary tumor, separated in the central part and invasive front, to
  the first lymphatic metastasis. Materials and Methods: Included in this study
  were 8 patients undergoing sentinel lymph node detection for invasive bladder
  cancer, of whom 4 had metastasis in the sentinel lymph node and 4 were randomly
  chosen without metastases. After microdissection p53 genomic structure and
  immunohistochemical expression of p53, pRB, Ki67 and E-cadherin were analyzed.
  Microvessel density and apoptosis were also assessed. Results: In 5 patients
  there were p53 gene mutations in the primary tumor, while 3 had the wild-type
  gene. The genotypes were identical in the central part and invasive front. All
  sentinel lymph node metastases harbored p53 mutations, in contrast to all
  nonmetastatic sentinel lymph nodes. Two patients had the same mutation as the
  primary tumor and 1 had an additional mutation. In a patient with a wild-type
  gene in each compartment of the primary tumor a mutation appeared in the
  corresponding sentinel lymph node metastasis. There was poor concordance of p53
  mutation with protein status. The expression of p53, pRB, Ki67, E-cadherin, and
  the evaluation of apoptosis and angiogenesis showed in most cases only slight
  variations in tumor compartments and the sentinel lymph node. Conclusions: In
  this study invasive bladder carcinoma involved monoclonal proliferations with a
  mainly homogenous biomarker profile. The first metastases in sentinel lymph
  nodes had a similar molecular profile but in half of the cases signs of clonal
  evolution appeared.

AB: Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a class of widely used flame
  retardants, are extensively diffused in the environment as shown by several
  studies on sentinel animal species, as well as humans. Of particular concern
  are the reported high levels of PBDEs in human milk, as almost no information
  is available on their potential effects on developing organisms. We
  investigated the effects of perinatal PBDE exposure on mouse neurobehavioural
  development. 2,2',4,4',5-pentabromodiphenylether (PBDE 99; 0.6, 6 and 30 mg/kg
  per day) was administered daily to CD-1 Swiss females by gavage from
  gestational day (GD) 6 to postnatal day (PND) 21. Aroclor 1254 (A1254; 6 mg/kg
  per day), a PCB mixture, was administered following the same schedule and
  served as a positive control. The PBDE 99 medium dose had an effect on litter
  viability. Sensori-motor development analysis (PNDs 2-20) revealed a delayed
  appearance of climbing response in the PBDE 99 high-dose group. On PND 11, the
  homing test revealed a trend for treated animals, particularly the A1254 group,
  to be more active than controls. This activity level alteration was strongly
  increased on PNDs 34 and 60 in an open-field arena. On PND 60, treated mice
  showed also an altered thigmotaxis, spending more time in the centre of the
  arena than controls. At adulthood, A1254 treated mice were still hyperactive,
  whereas the PBDE 99 groups tended to be hypoactive. These findings showed that
  perinatal exposure to PBDE 99 produces several behavioural alterations and that
  its effects are not always similar to those of A1254. The possibility of
  exposure of neonates to PBDEs warrants further studies to characterise their
  developmental neurotoxicity.

AB: In searching for the cause of experimental variations in respiratory
  research data, serology revealed the prevalence of antibodies against
  parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV 3) in guinea pigs. The aim of the present study
  was to explore the transmission rate, course, and kinetics of enzootic PIV 3
  infection in guinea pig breeding units. In the first part of the study, blood
  samples to be analyzed for PIV 3 antibodies were collected from guinea pigs of
  a PIV 3-positive breeding colony at different times after birth. In the same
  breeding unit, 6 of 12 2-week-old guinea pigs were relocated and separately
  housed. The PIV 3 serum antibody titers of the two groups were compared at
  various times from birth to 13 weeks after birth. In the second part of the
  study, the spread of infectious virus and virus persistence were explored by
  housing seronegative sentinel animals together with 2- to 3-week-old guinea
  pigs from three different PIV 3-positive breeding units. The guinea pigs
  remaining in the breeding colony as well as those removed and housed separately
  showed declining serum antibody titers for about 1 month after birth,
  thereafter the titers were stable until about 8 weeks after birth. Five weeks
  later, the mean antibody titer of the guinea pigs remaining in the breeding
  colony had increased to a markedly higher level than that of the relocated,
  separately housed guinea pigs. Seroconversion was demonstrated in 7 of the 14
  sentinels housed with the 2- to 3-week-old guinea pigs from PIV 3-positive
  breeding units. Sentinels housed together with PIV 3-positive guinea pigs 24
  weeks after the start of the experiment did not seroconvert. We conclude that
  young guinea pigs born to PIV 3-positive mothers were protected by maternal
  immunity against infection with PIV 3 during their first 14 days of life. The
  guinea pig offspring became infected during the period from about 2 weeks until
  8 weeks after birth, as demonstrated by seroconversion of sentinel animals and
  an increasing mean antibody titer seen beyond 8 weeks of age. The study did not
  reveal any indication of virus persistence or prolonged carrier status.

AB: This study evaluated protection against mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) afforded
  by static filter-top caging when automatic watering was used with conventional
  husbandry techniques as a labor-saving option. We fitted one side of a double
  -sided 72-cage rack with valves external to each cage; cages on the other side
  were fitted with shielded internal valves. More than 50% of the mice were
  breeding mice, and 30% were genetically altered. One cage of mice on each shelf
  on both sides of the rack was infected with MHV-A59. Each row of cages also
  contained one standard cage (no filter top) of uninoculated mice at various
  distances from the infected cage. At 2, 4, and 6 weeks after infection of the
  mice in the test cages, uninoculated mice in 22 cages were tested by serology,
  and at 8 weeks the uninoculated mice in 54 cages were tested by serology and
  those in 24 cages were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification
  of fecal samples to assess transmission of infection. At 8 weeks post
  -infection, mice in one uninoculated cage (which had a filter top and an
  internal valve and was adjacent to a cage of inoculated mice) was seropositive.
  Examination of feces by PCR revealed MHV shedding in mice in nine uninoculated
  cages (three lacking filter tops but with internal valve cages; two with filter
  tops and internal valve cages and adjacent to non-filter top cages; two non
  -filter-top cages with external valves; and two filter-top cages with external
  valves, of which one was adjacent to a non-filter-top cage). Routine husbandry
  using either automatic water valve system prevented (with one exception)
  transmission among filter-top cages for at least 6 weeks. The 10 cages where
  transmission occurred were non-filter-top cages (n=5) and filter-top cages
  adjacent to non-filter top, infected, or sentinel cages (n=5). These results
  suggest that the use of filter top-caging with automatic watering may limit MHV
  transmission for 6 weeks, during which immunocompetent mice would be expected
  to clear the virus. Our findings also suggest that long-term use of automatic
  watering in static filter-top cages handled using conventional husbandry
  techniques may not prevent transmission in the vicinity of high virus
  concentrations or open caging.

AB: This study was undertaken to validate potential biomarkers of exposure and
  effects due to chemical contaminants in breeding colonies of the Great Blue
  Heron and the Black-crowned Night-Heron on the St. Lawrence River. Eggs and
  fledglings from both species were collected from many colonies along the River.
  The fledglings from colonies in freshwater and brackish water were more
  contaminated by mercury and PCBs than those from estuarine and gulf colonies.
  With respect to fledglings of the two heron species, some morphometric and
  blood biochemical measurements, including plasma thyroid hormones and retinol,
  were significantly different among colonies. Significant differences were also
  observed in liver retinoids, EROD and porphyrins among colonies. The results of
  this study suggest that plasma retinoids and thyroid hormones are good
  biomarkers of exposure and effects, and are sufficiently sensitive to reflect
  local and regional variations in contamination. Along with the measure of
  contaminants in egg and plasma, they constitute non-invasive biomarkers which
  represent an important criteria for long term monitoring of wildlife species.
  It is concluded that the Great Blue Heron is an appropriate sentinel species in
  the surveillance network for the St. Lawrence River.

AB: The Madison River, Montana, is the site of a whirling disease epizootic
  among rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss caused by the parasite Myxobolus
  cerebralis. We investigated how the timing and location of the spawning and
  rearing of rainbow trout influences the risk of exposure to the parasite.
  Sentinel fish exposures were used to assess the spatial and temporal variation
  in disease severity in 1998 and 1999. Redd counts, radiotelemetry of spawning
  rainbow trout, and electrofishing estimates of fry abundance indicated that
  during the critical 2-3-month posthatch period, when rainbow trout are most
  susceptible to whirling disease, the majority of fry in the Madison River
  population are concentrated within a relatively small portion of the upper
  drainage. Disease severity ranged from low to very high in this area of the
  river. Large temporal variation in disease severity was also evident: severity
  was significantly higher in the spring than in the fall and in 1999 than in
  1998. These data indicate that the effects of whirling disease on rainbow trout
  populations are governed by a complex interaction between the timing and
  location of key life history events (spawning, emergence, and early rearing)
  and the spatial and temporal variation in the presence of the infectious stages
  of M. cerebralis. Life history diversity within rainbow trout populations may
  therefore help buffer the effects of whirling disease and help explain why
  population-level effects are so variable among infected populations.

AB: Purpose: We attempted to detect lymphatic drainage and sentinel lymph node
  with radioactive tracer in patients with testicular tumor. We then tried to
  determine if sentinel lymph node biopsy with gamma probe guided laparoscopic
  procedure was feasible as a staging tool for patients with clinical stage I
  testicular tumor. Materials and Methods: 99mTechnetium-labeled phytate was
  injected around the tumor in 15 consecutive patients with clinical stage I
  testicular tumor. Lymphatic drainage and sentinel lymph nodes were imaged by a
  gamma camera. Localization of the sentinel lymph node was confirmed with a
  handheld gamma probe. After we confirmed that sentinel lymph nodes were
  detected in the initial 10 patients, gamma probe guided laparoscopic sentinel
  lymph node biopsy was performed after routine orchiectomy in the next 4. To
  confirm whether the radioactive node was really a sentinel lymph node the final
  patient in this series underwent laparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph node
  dissection with a unilateral template. Results: Sentinel lymph nodes were
  detected in all patients by lymphoscintigraphy and handheld gamma probe, and
  each node varied. Right tumors in sentinel lymph node were detected at the
  inter-aortocaval, paracaval or common iliac region. Para-aortic lymph nodes
  were detected as sentinel lymph node in cases of left tumor. In the 4 patients
  who underwent gamma probe navigated laparoscopic procedure sentinel lymph nodes
  were easily detected and safely removed for pathological examination. In the
  last patient who underwent laparoscopic lymph node dissection micrometastasis
  was found only at the sentinel lymph node. Conclusions: Sentinel lymph node can
  be detected by lymphoscintigraphy and handheld gamma probe. Gamma probe guided
  laparoscopic biopsy of sentinel lymph node is technically possible. These
  techniques may have a role in the management of clinical stage I testicular
  tumor but further trials are required for establishment of the concept of
  sentinel lymph node in testicular tumor.

AB: Bacterial biofilms are a common cause of persistent disease in humans. They
  are responsible for a number of illnesses including cystic fibrosis,
  endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and various nosocomial diseases related to central
  venous catheters, urinary catheters, prosthetic heart valves, and orthopedic
  devices. Staphylococcus aureus is a common pathogen responsible for nosocomial
  as well as community infections. This pathogen readily colonizes indwelling
  catheters and forms microbiotic communities termed biofilms. S. aureus bacteria
  in biofilms are more resistant to clearance from antibiotics and attack from
  the body's immune system than their respective planktonic counterparts. For
  years, the mechanism behind biofilm resistance to attack from the immune
  system's sentinel leukocytes has been conceptualized as a lack in the ability
  of the leukocytes to penetrate the biofilm. We demonstrate that leukocytes
  attach to and penetrate a fully mature (7-day-old) S. aureus biofilm. We also
  demonstrate that a maturing (2-day-old) biofilm elicits a cytokine response
  after 2 hrs post incubation with human leukocytes. Specifically, cytokines IL
  -1beta, IL-12 and IFN-gamma were induced, suggesting an attempt to mount a Th1
  -type response. These data represent the first demonstration of leukocytes
  penetrating a mature biofilm and also represent the first characterization of a
  cytokine response to a S. aureus biofilm.

AB: The area of free radical biology is of increasing interest for marine
  organisms since the enhanced formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a
  common pathway of toxicity induced by stressful environmental conditions. In
  polar environments responses of the antioxidant system could be useful as an
  early detection biomarkers of unforeseen effects of human activities which are
  progressively increasing in these remote areas. However, the characterization
  of antioxidant defences in appropriate sentinel species is of particular value
  also in terms of a possible adaptation to this extreme environment. The
  scallop, Adamussium colbecki, is a key species for monitoring the Antarctic
  environment and, besides single antioxidants, the total oxyradical scavenging
  capacity (TOSC) assay has been recently used for quantifying the overall
  ability of this organism to neutralize peroxyl radicals (ROO.), hydroxyl
  radicals (.OH) and peroxynitrite (HOONO). The aim of this work was to obtain a
  better characterization of these biological responses which can indicate the
  occurrence of biological disturbance; in this study the total oxyradical
  scavenging capacity was further analyzed to assess the presence of seasonal
  fluctuations in the susceptibility to oxidative stress in this species. The
  capability to neutralize peroxyl radicals and hydroxyl radicals increased at
  the end of December, while resistance towards peroxynitrite did not show any
  significant variations during the Antarctic summer. These results suggest the
  occurrence of metabolic changes which mainly influence intracellular formation
  of ROO. and .OH, with more limited effects on HOONO. Despite the limited time
  window analyzed, as a typical constraint in Antarctic research at Terra Nova
  Bay, an increased resistance to these specific oxyradicals might be related to
  the period of highest feeding activity, or to other intrinsic factors in the
  animals' physiology such as the phase of reproductive cycle.

AB: Sentinel practice networks have been established in many European countries
  to monitor disease incidence in the community. To demonstrate the value of
  sentinel networks an international study on the incidence of chicken pox has
  been undertaken. Chickenpox was chosen as an acute condition for which
  incidence data are important to the determination of health policy on vaccine
  use. The project examined the incidence of chickenpox reported in sentinel
  networks in England and Wales, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain (two
  regional networks) in January-June 2000 and the potential underestimate from
  patients who did not consult. An investigation of secondary household contact
  cases was undertaken. Reported incidence of chickenpox (all ages) in England
  and Wales was 25 per 10,000, in the Netherlands 13 per 10,000, in Portugal 21
  per 10,000, in Spain Castilla y Leon 27 per 10,000 and in Spain Basque 55 per
  10,000. Analysis of secondary contact cases suggested underestimation of
  incidence between 2.4% in Spain Castilla y Leon and 32.2% in The Netherlands.
  There was a trend towards incidence at an earlier age in England and Wales and
  in the Netherlands compared with Portugal and Spain. Whilst there was little
  problem in reliably identifying the number of incident cases in the recording
  networks and relating the non-consulting contact cases to them, the security of
  the denominator remains a problem where networks are comprised of differing
  categories of health care provider. It is essential that numerator and
  denominator information are made available specifically for each category.

AB: Management of the clinically N0 neck in head and neck squamous cell
  carcinoma is still under debate. Tumour spread to the neck is the most
  important prognostic factor in head and neck cancer patients. The sentinel node
  technique comprises the identification of the sentinel node by means of dye or
  isotope or a combination, and surgical removal followed by histological
  examination. We have reviewed the preliminary reports indicating that sentinel
  node identification is technically feasible in head and neck cancer surgery,
  i.e. in solitary and unilaterally oral and pharyngeal cancer stages T1 and T2
  with clinical N0. However, the existing reports enrole observational studies,
  thus randomised trials should be considered to gain maximum valid data to prove
  that sentinel node biopsy has an effect on parameters such as loco-regional
  control and survival.

  of Nova Iguacu, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Virus isolation in Ae.
  albopictus clone C6/36 cell line and a semi-nested reverse transcription
  -polymerase chain reaction detected only dengue virus type 3 in three pools of
  Ae. aegypti, despite the co-circulation of DEN-1, DEN-2 and DEN-3 serotypes in
  that area. No viruses were detected in Ae. albopictus mosquitoes. This
  virological surveillance consists in a sentinel system alerting for dengue

AB: Axillary lymph node (LN) dissection is an important staging procedure for
  invasive ductal breast carcinoma (IDC), but causes elevated morbidity. Reliable
  preoperative prediction of metastases is at present not possible. We
  investigated whether flow cytometric analysis of primary IDC can correctly
  predict the presence of LN metastases at the time of primary diagnosis. In 341
  primary IDC, DNA index (DI) in absolute values, S-phase fraction (SPF), size of
  the primary tumor, tumor grade (G), estrogen/progesterone receptors (ER/PR)
  expression and age were analysed and correlated with the axillary LN status
  with the aim of correctly predicting the LN status. No predictive value was
  identified for S-phase fraction (SPF), tumor grade, or ER/PR expression. The DI
  correlated statistically with LN status in all patients. A practically useful
  association was, however, only observed in 37 women aged 45-58 years with an
  IDC >2 cm diameter: a DI >1.44 predicted the presence of LN metastases at the
  time of operation with a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 89%, a
  negative predictive value of 91% and a positive predictive value of 100%.
  Determination of the absolute values of the DI may be a useful adjunct to
  sentinel LN preparation when predicting the axillary LN status and may spare
  some women the morbidity associated with axillary LN dissection.

AB: The isotopic detection of the sentinel node is undergoing a fast development
  in breast cancer and melanoma. It requires a good collaboration between a
  surgeon and a nuclear medicine specialist. Although the method is now well
  defined for melanoma, several options remain possible for breast cancer. The
  injected dose and volume can differ between centers, as well as the sites of
  injection in terms of their number, anatomical location and depth. However,
  since all options seem to provide equivalent results, a single intradermal
  periareolar injection could be the preferred choice. The role of imaging
  remains controversial, but it provides a definite complementary information, in
  particular in case of an unusual location of the sentinel node. The addition of
  dye injection also adds to the results. The optimal use of a peroperative hand
  -held gamma probe requires some training for the surgeon. A good selection of
  the indications is essential for a successful detection. Other fields of
  application are under investigation such as colon cancer, head and neck tumors,
  lung and prostate cancers. By avoiding a majority of the routine axillary lymph
  nodes dissections in small breast cancer, the isotopic detection of the
  sentinel node should dramatically decrease the morbidity of axillary staging
  and the duration of hospital stay for the patients.

  must be established continuously in order to ensure homeostasis or to initiate
  immune and inflammatory responses. Owing to their strategic location in
  peripheral tissues and their prompt response to various stimuli, mast cells can
  be considered as the cell prototype to fulfill such a sentinel function. There
  are several ways for mast cells to communicate with other cells including cell
  -cell interactions via membrane-associated receptors, cytokines and other
  soluble mediators, and a newly described messenger which consists of membrane
  vesicles called exosomes carrying a number of immunoregulatory molecules.

AB: To date, there are no published MHC sequences from the California sea lion
  (Zalophus californianus), a thriving species that, by feeding high on the
  marine food web, could be a sentinel for disturbances in marine and coastal
  ecosystems. In this study, degenerate primers and RACE technology were used to
  amplify near-full-length (MhcZaca-DQB) and full-length (MhcZaca-DQA) expressed
  class II MHC gene products from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of two
  California sea lions in rehabilitation. Five unique Zaca-DQA sequences and
  eight unique Zaca-DQB sequences, all encoding functional proteins, were
  identified in the two animals, indicating the presence of multiple DQ-loci in
  this species. An additional three Zaca-DQB sequences containing features
  compatible with pseudogenes or null alleles were also identified. Despite the
  identification of multiple DQA and DQB sequences, the degree of heterogeneity
  between them was extremely low. To confirm the limited degree of Zaca-DQ
  nucleotide variation between individuals, we used denaturing gradient gel
  electrophoresis to examine putative peptide binding region sequences from the
  peripheral blood leukocyte-derived RNAs of 19 wild-caught California sea lions
  from physically distinct populations. The pattern of Zaca-DQ sequence migration
  was identical between individuals and independent of geographical region. This
  apparent Zaca-DQ sequence identity between sea lions was confirmed by direct
  sequencing of individual bands. In combination, these findings raise important
  questions regarding immunogenetic diversity within this thriving species, and
  should prompt further research into the existence of a highly polymorphic sea
  lion class II MHC molecule with sequence features that support traditional
  peptide binding functions.

AB: The promise of biomarkers to detect and diagnose cancer in its earliest
  stage has never been greater. Knowledge of molecular events during the early
  stages of cancer has advanced at a rapid pace. This advancement has been aided
  by the development of new high-throughput technologies, enabling the detection
  of molecular changes at genomic and proteomic levels. Applications of biomarker
  detection in clinical practice has been limited to single entity quantitation
  or small panels of tests that identify changes in proteins whose presence or
  absence signifies an important event. As more biomarkers are discovered it has
  become evident that no single marker will provide the information necessary to
  make the best decision in detection and diagnosis. With this in mind, the
  National Cancer Institute's Early Detection Research Network is promoting a
  multi-parametric, multi-markers approach to biomarkers development and
  validation. High density oligonucleotide and cDNA arrays are generating
  information to predict and understand the disease state that can be used to
  develop novel sentinel endpoints for chemopreventive interventions. In
  contrast, proteomic-based approaches, such as, a surface enhanced laser
  desorption and ionization time-of-flight (SELDI-TOF) and matrix assisted laser
  desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF), are enabling rapid
  ascertainment of disease status directly from human body fluids, serum, and
  seminal plasma. These potentially new paradigms for diagnostic technologies are
  rapid (within minutes), require small samples (less than 1 muL), and, most
  importantly, are sensitive and accurate in predicting the disease state. Some
  examples of these applications are discussed.

AB: The pathogenic Neisseria species primarily include Neisseria gonorrhoeae and
  Neisseria meningitidis. It is not necessary to perform antimicrobial
  susceptibility tests routinely on clinical isolates of either of these species,
  because they are generally susceptible to the drugs of choice. However,
  reliable methods are needed for testing isolates collected through sentinel
  surveillance programs. Additionally, testing is warranted when individual
  patients infected with N. gonorrhoeae or N. meningitidis experience clinical
  failure when treated with the drugs of choice. NCCLS describes standard methods
  and a special medium for testing N. gonorrhoeae by disk diffusion and agar
  dilution. Although NCCLS suggests use of cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth
  supplemented with 2-5% lysed horse blood for testing N. meningitidis, there are
  no standard interpretive criteria for any agents and this species. Interpretive
  criteria specified for N. gonorrhoeae should not be used for other Neisseria
  species. All tests for N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis are incubated in CO2.
  On the rare occasions when Neisseria species other than N. gonorrhoeae or N.
  meningitidis require testing, the approach should be similar to that for
  testing N. meningitidis.

AB: Intraoperative lymphatic mapping to identify the sentinel lymph node (SLN)
  has significantly changed the management of regional lymph node basin of
  patients with various types of solid tumors such as melanoma and breast cancer.
  The procedure has improved the diagnosis of micrometastasis in the regional
  tumor-draining lymph nodes by providing a focused histopathological assessment
  of select lymph nodes most likely to harbor occult disease. Blue dye and/or
  radioisotopes are efficient mapping agents but the lack of accurate methods to
  quantify their presence and the potential for dissolution and decay,
  respectively, throughout time limit their role as reliable markers for
  identifying a sentinel node from additional secondary lymph nodes that may be
  either blue and/or radioactive to some degree. A consistently durable marker is
  needed that can be introduced during surgery and successfully quantitated among
  tumor-draining lymph nodes to permit a more accurate assessment of hierarchical
  organization. This may be of particular importance in retrospective analysis of
  archival tissues as there are no inherent markers to denote the SLN from
  successive echelon nodes. A procedure of molecular lymphatic mapping (MLM) was
  developed in a rat model to label the SLN preoperatively with rice gene DNA
  containing plasmid or linear rice DNA fragment (rDNA). The MLM efficiency was
  demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of the molecular
  marker in both frozen and paraffin-embedded SLN; 1.25 mug of rDNA injected with
  blue dye could be reproducibly detected by PCR. The MLM procedure was validated
  in a rat breast tumor model with lymph node metastasis. The procedure was
  successful in permanently labeling and identifying by PCR both frozen and
  paraffin-embedded SLN. MLM in conjunction with a conventional mapping agent can
  be used as a valuable asset for molecular assessment of the SLN and
  retrospective analysis of paraffin-embedded specimens.

AB: Background/Aims: In order to examine the biology of sentinel lymph node of
  stomach cancer, we investigated solitary lymph node metastases that were
  hypothesized to represent sentinel lymph node. Methodology: In the 4,620
  primary gastric cancers between 1964 and 1997, 1271 cases with a localized
  tumor were selected and the localization of the solitary metastases in relation
  to the primary tumors were studied. Results: Of the 130 tumors with a single
  basin metastasis, only 71% of the tumors in the upper third, 75% of the middle
  and 80% of the lower involved the node basins in the close vicinity. In the
  anterior wall and the greater curvature the rates of adjacent metastasis were
  more than 90%, while in the posterior wall and the lesser curvature they were
  76% and 43%, respectively. Metastases of the remaining cases were found at more
  distant basins. Conclusions: In stomach cancer sensitivity of sentinel lymph
  node biopsy would be very low by the exploration of the adjacent basin
  especially for the lesions in the lesser curvature and posterior wall.

AB: Modulation of cell adhesion molecule expression plays a key role in melanoma
  metastasis. In particular, the expression of the cell adhesion molecule L1 has
  been associated with the metastatic phenotype in a murine model of malignant
  melanoma. However, no such association between L1 expression and metastasis has
  been investigated in a clinical study. Therefore, L1 expression was determined
  immunohistochemically in 100 cases of malignant melanoma and correlated with
  metastasis in a 10-year retrospective study. Furthermore, nine distant
  metastases and five sentinel lymph node metastases were analysed for their L1
  expression. Additionally, the expression of alpha2,3 sialic acid residues,
  which are recognised by the siglec domain of L1, was determined by Maackia
  amurensis agglutinin (MAA) lectin histochemistry. The log-rank test between
  Kaplan-Meier curves revealed a positive association between L1 expression and
  metastasis (P<0.0001) and multivariate Cox regression analysis adjusted for
  tumour thickness, ulceration and mitotic rate confirmed the prognostic power of
  L1 in malignant melanoma. As alpha2,3 sialic acid residues were absent in
  melanoma cells, homotypic adhesion between melanoma cells via their siglec
  domain can be excluded, suggesting a different adhesive function of L1 during
  melanoma metastasis. The functional role of L1 was further stressed by the fact
  that its expression was preserved in metastatic lesions.

AB: In Haiti, a novel approach to nutritional surveillance was developed on the
  basis of a low-cost, simple-to-repeat set of household surveys in all nine
  administrative departments using sentinel community sites. This system allows
  each department to independently conduct follow-up surveys as needed. The
  results of the first round of surveys conducted in 1995 show lower malnutrition
  rates in typical food-deficient departments and high levels of malnutrition in
  several food-surplus areas. Further analyses underscore the importance of
  variables related to child-care practices and of care-enabling factors such as
  household food security, health environment, and caregivers' time and
  education. These findings challenge the traditional thinking among a majority
  of Haitian policy makers who look at the malnutrition problem solely from the
  perspective of local food production.

AB: Background: In recent surveillance data there are still many cases of
  measles and even local epidemics in Germany. We studied whether delayed measles
  vaccination contributes to this situation. Methods: Vaccine coverage data in
  children <3 years of age were assessed by a telephone survey. Three data
  sources for measles surveillance were analyzed: official measles notifications;
  sentinel data; and official hospital discharge diagnoses. Results: After the
  time recommended for completion of measles vaccination at Month 15, only 22% of
  German children had received their first vaccine dose. This percentage
  increased to 77% at the age of 24 months and to 87% at 36 months of age.
  According to all three surveillance instruments, the number of measles cases
  was highest in children age 1 to 4 years with a peak in the second year of
  life. Conclusions: More than 50% of measles cases in 1-year-old children would
  be prevented if presently observed vaccine coverage rates in the third year of
  life could be achieved 12 months earlier. Delayed measles vaccination is
  responsible for a large number of measles cases still occurring in the German
  population, where measles has not yet been eliminated. If vaccination were
  delivered according to the recommended time schedule, the incidence of measles
  would be considerably reduced.

AB: The sentinel node, which is not always located at the first-echelon nodal
  area close to the primary tumor, is the initial recipient of possible
  metastasis. In order to verify the usefulness of the sentinel lymph node
  technique in the staging of head and neck cancers, we studied 31 untreated
  patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the upper airways by injecting them
  around the primary tumor with technetium 99m albumin microcolloid (99mTc) and
  submitting them to selective neck dissection with en bloc tumor removal. The
  nodes were examined after gamma-probe identification of the sentinel node(s).
  No patients were found to have microscopic tumor spread outside the level(s)
  containing the gamma-probe-identified sentinel node(s). In only 1 case was the
  metastatic node not the gamma-probe-positive one, but an adjacent one.
  Lymphoscintigraphy with 99mTc seems reliable in identifying the sentinel
  node(s) and might contribute to the reduction of surgical morbidity by
  reserving therapeutic neck dissection for cases with histologically confirmed
  nodal metastasis.

AB: Objective: The objective of this study was to explore the relationship
  between low density lipoprotein (LDL) and dendritic cell (DC) activation, based
  upon the hypothesis that reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated modification of
  proteins that may be present in local DC microenvironments could be important
  as mediators of this activation. Although LDL are known to be oxidised in vivo,
  and taken up by macrophages during atherogenesis; their effect on DC has not
  been explored previously. Methods: Human DCs were prepared from peripheral
  blood monocytes using GM-CSF and IL-4. Plasma LDLs were isolated by sequential
  gradient centrifugation, oxidised in CuSO4, and oxidation arrested to yield
  mild, moderate and highly oxidised LDL forms. DCs exposed to these LDLs were
  investigated using combined phenotypic, functional (autologous T cell
  activation), morphological and viability assays. Results: Highly-oxidised LDL
  increased DC HLA-DR, CD40 and CD86 expression, corroborated by increased DC
  -induced T cell proliferation. Both native and oxidised LDL induced prominent
  DC clustering. However, high concentrations of highly-oxidised LDL inhibited DC
  function, due to increased DC apoptosis. Conclusions: This study supports the
  hypothesis that oxidised LDL are capable of triggering the transition from
  sentinel to messenger DC. Furthermore, the DC clustering-activation-apoptosis
  sequence in the presence of different LDL forms is consistent with a regulatory
  DC role in immunopathogenesis of atheroma. A sequence of initial accumulation
  of DC, increasing LDL oxidation, and DC-induced T cell activation, may explain
  why local breach of tolerance can occur. Above a threshold level, however,
  supervening DC apoptosis limits this, contributing instead to the central
  plaque core.

AB: We report a sentinel case of acute eosinophilic pneumonia in a firefighter
  exposed to high concentrations of World Trade Center dust during the rescue
  effort from September 11 to 24. The firefighter presented with a PaO2 of 53 mm
  Hg and responded to oxygen and corticosteroids. Computed tomography scan showed
  patchy ground glass density, thickened bronchial walls, and bilateral pleural
  effusions. Bronchoalveolar lavage recovered 70% eosinophils, with only 1%
  eosinophils in peripheral blood. Eosinophils were not degranulated and
  increased levels of interleukin-5 were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage and
  serum. Mineralogic analysis counted 305 commercial asbestos fibers/106
  macrophages including those with high aspect ratios, and significant quantities
  of fly ash and degraded fibrous glass. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia is a rare
  consequence of acute high dust exposure. World Trade Center dust consists of
  large particle-size silicates, but fly ash and asbestos fibers may be found in
  bronchoalveolar lavage cells.

AB: Many centers use techniques for localizing the sentinel lymph node (SLN)
  associated with a breast tumor. Protocols involve the use of an intraoperative
  probe and blue dye but may or may not include scintigraphy. Methods: Three
  methods of body-outline imaging were investigated to aid SLN localization. Body
  outlines were acquired using a handheld source; a transmission image was
  acquired from a 57Co-flood source; and, finally, a new method is described
  using a 153Gd-line source attenuation correction for body outline. Results:
  Method 1 images were of low quality, although 83% of SLNs were visualized. Body
  outline was unsatisfactory for surgical localization. Method 2 was
  unsatisfactory because of the lack of a lateral image. Method 3 enabled good
  presurgical visualization of the SLN (73%) and speeded surgical localization.
  Conclusion: The 153Gd-line source consistently gives optimal-quality body
  -outline images. This source is simple, quick, and clearly locates the SLN on
  multiple projections.

AB: Preventing campylobacteriosis depends on a thorough understanding of its
  epidemiology. We used case-case analysis to compare cases of Campylobacter coli
  infection with cases of C. jejuni infection, to generate hypotheses for
  infection from standardized, population-based sentinel surveillance information
  in England and Wales. Persons with C. coli infection were more likely to have
  drunk bottled water than were those with C. jejuni infection and, in general,
  were more likely to have eaten pate. Important differences in exposures were
  identified for these two Campylobacter species. Exposures that are a risk for
  infection for both comparison groups might not be identified or might be
  underestimated by case-case analysis. Similarly, the magnitude or direction of
  population risk cannot be assessed accurately. Nevertheless, our findings
  suggest that case-control studies should be conducted at the species level.

AB: Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a recently identified Paramyxovirus first
  isolated from hospitalized children with acute respiratory tract infections
  (ARTI). We sought evidence of HMPV infection in patients who had visited
  general practitioners, had influenzalike illnesses (ILI), and had negative
  tests for influenza and Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV). As part of
  national virologic surveillance, sentinel general practices in England and
  Wales collected samples from patients of all ages with ILI during winter 2000
  -01. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HMPV, influenza
  A (H1 and H3), influenza B, and HRSV (A and B) was used to screen combined nose
  and throat swabs. PCR products from the HMPV-positive samples were sequenced to
  confirm identity and construct phylogenetic trees. Of 711 swabs submitted, 408
  (57.3%) were negative for influenza and HRSV; HMPV was identified in 9 (2.2%)
  patients. HMPV appears to be associated with community-acquired ARTI. The
  extent of illness and possible complications related to this new human virus
  need to be clarified.

AB: This paper summarizes the results of trials performed in two hospitals,
  comparing the scoring of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) on the
  same neonates and within the same test session, recorded by the fully automatic
  device EchoScreen (Madsen Electronics/Fischer-Zoth GmbH) and ILO Otodynamics
  Ltd system. These trials form part of a larger project (Project Sentinel),
  whose primary aim is to stimulate the creation of new neonatal hearing
  screening programmes. Four thousand two hundred and forty-eight neonates were
  tested with both devices (8494 ears), in randomized order. The response scores
  obtained with the two devices are in full agreement in 98.72% of the tested
  ears. Considering the recording time, the fully automatic Echo Screen was, on
  average, about 3.6 times faster than the ILO88, bearing in mind, however, that
  when using ILO88, the end of the recording is decided by the operator on the
  basis of some mandatory decision rules.

AB: Background: Rapid-cycling, real-time PCR instruments bring the opportunity
  for improved intraoperative detection of metastasis to sentinel lymph nodes.
  Rapid, standardized, and internally controlled assays need to be developed that
  are sensitive and accurate. Methods: We describe rapid, multiplexed, internally
  controlled, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (QRT-PCR) assays for
  tyrosinase and carcinoembryonic antigen mRNAs on the SmartCycler (Cepheid). We
  used a temperature-controlled primer-limiting approach to eliminate
  amplification of the endogenous control gene as soon as its signal had reached
  threshold. Positive-control oligonucleotide mimics were incorporated into all
  reactions to differentiate failed reactions from true negative samples.
  Results: The optimized assays for rapid QRT-PCR yielded results with threshold
  cycle values that were only 1-2 cycles higher than slower, more conventional
  protocols. In rapid PCR, the temperature-controlled multiplex assay was
  quantitative over a dynamic range of at least 15 cycles, compared with only 6
  cycles for conventional multiplexing methods. All histologically positive lymph
  nodes examined were also QRT-PCR positive for the appropriate marker, and the
  exogenous, internal positive-control mimics produced signals in all negative
  samples. Conclusion: Internally controlled, rapid QRT-PCR assays can be
  performed in an intraoperative time frame and with sufficient sensitivity to
  detect histologically identified metastases to lymph nodes.

AB: Background: Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) is a common cause of
  gastroenteritis in developing countries and the most common cause of travelers'
  diarrhea worldwide. U.S. ETEC infections may be on the rise because of
  increased foreign produce consumption and international travel. Data on
  incidence and outbreaks in the U.S. are rare because clinical laboratories do
  not test for ETEC. Methods: Surveillance for ETEC was established at two
  sentinel laboratories in Minnesota. A case-control study was conducted from
  January 1 through August 31, 2000. ETEC PCR-positive specimens were identified
  at MDH and standard questionnaires were administered to cases and two controls
  per case. The questionnaire included illness, travel, and produce consumption
  history. Results: PCR positive results were found in 43 of 2900 (1.5%) samples.
  Sixteen of 43 (37%) were positive for both heat labile toxin (LT) and heat
  stable toxin (ST), 13 (30%) for LT only, and 14 (33%) for ST only. From the
  2900 cultures, ETEC was the third most common reportable enteric bacterial
  infection after Campylobacter (81) and Shigella (67). There were 37 Salmonella
  and 25 E. coli 0157:H7. Of the 43 identified cases, 37 were interviewed and 23
  were included in the case-control study. Peak incidence was in June and July.
  International travel within 7 days of onset was significantly associated with
  ETEC infection (18 of 23 cases vs. 0 of 45 controls) Conclusion: ETEC
  infections appear to be as common as other routinely identified enteric
  pathogens. Data from this study may support routine active surveillance for
  ETEC. ETEC cases were strongly associated with international travel; however,
  22% of cases were domestically acquired. The sources of non-travel cases
  require further study. Domestically acquired infections are probably under
  -recognized because physicians are more likely to culture individuals who have
  traveled.

AB: Background: Acinetobacter spp., particularly A. baumannii, are often
  multiresistant to antibiotics, complicating both therapy and infection control.
  Some strains are reported resistant to all agents, including carbapenems. To
  assess the extent of these problems we surveyed antibiotic susceptibilities of
  Acinetobacter isolated from routine clinical specimens in sentinel laboratories
  throughout the UK. Methods: 615 consecutive acinetobacters from different
  patients were collected from clinical specimens submitted to 54 UK
  laboratories. MICs were determined on Iso-Sensitest agar and interpreted using
  the breakpoints of the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy.
  Tigilcycline (GAR-936), a new glycylcycline, was tested along with established
  agents. Results: 99% of isolates were susceptible to meropenem; 98% to
  imipenem; 95% to colistin; 90% to minocycline; 88% to sulbactam (at ltoreq8
  mg/mL); 79% to amikacin; 70% to piperacillin/tazobactam; 63% to gentamicin; 63%
  to ciprofloxacin; 37% to piperacillin; 17% to tetracycline; 16% to ceftazidime
  and 7% to cefotaxime. The MIC50 and MIC90 of tigilcycline were 0.5 and 2 mg/ml
  respectively and relative activities of the tetracyclines were
  minocycline>tigilcycline>tetracycline. Seven centres sent a total of 14
  carbapenem-resistant isolates (MICs, gtoreq8 mg/mL); 5 centres sent single
  isolates; one sent 3 and one sent 6. Nine isolates were resistant to imipenem,
  2 to meropenem, and 3 to both agents. Conclusions: Carbapenems, colistin and
  minocycline retained greatest activity against the Acinetobacter isolates
  collected. Tigilcycline was less active than minocycline, but both agents
  overcame most tetracycline resistance. Carbapenem resistance was found, but
  remains very rare.

AB: The objective of this study was to identify likely proximate cues to the
  seasonal migrations of cod, Gadus morhua L., in the southern Gulf of St
  Lawrence. We computed a migration timing index across several years using
  commercial fishery (1970-1992) and sentinel survey (1995-1999) catch rate data,
  and closely monitored the seasonal changes in temperature, dissolved oxygen,
  food intake, and energy stores between 1995 and 1998. The inter-year
  variability in the timing of the seasonal migrations was relatively low (s.d.=8
  d for spring migration, 10 d for autumn migration), suggesting that photoperiod
  was involved in the control mechanism of migration. However, other factors were
  also implicated in the control mechanism, given that cod initiated the autumn
  migration progressively earlier in the late 1980s and 1990s. At the onset of
  the autumn migration, dissolved oxygen concentrations were above levels known
  to induce avoidance behaviour in this species, and food resources were
  considered to be relatively abundant. Similarly, cod did not initiate the
  autumn migration at a specific temperature or following a particular
  temperature regime experienced during summer. However, cross correlation
  function analysis indicated that a widespread cooling of near bottom waters
  preceded the mid-1980s shift in migration timing by one to two years,
  suggesting that the cooling event was linked in some way to the change in
  migration dates. Other correlations showed that the earlier migrations
  coincided with older cod becoming more abundant and smaller in size, and also
  with their principal fish prey (herring and capelin) increasing in number.
  These results suggest that older cod played a key role in launching the early
  autumn migrations. One plausible interpretation is that their decline in body
  size and lipid-rich diets led to a rapid build up of energy reserves over
  summer grounds, and thus to an earlier readiness to engage in the autumn
  migration. We discuss the potential impact of earlier departures on stock
  productivity.

AB: Surveys, conducted by GEAC (Groundfish Enterprise Allocation Council) in
  collaboration with DFO, were carried out between 1998 and 2000 in the Gulf of
  St. Lawrence according to a definite sampling strategy. The main objectives of
  these grid surveys were to describe the distribution of redfish in the Gulf of
  St. Lawrence and at the mouth of the Gulf and to construct an abundance index.
  To fulfil these objectives, a systematic grid sampling plan was used. The
  distribution of the redfish catches for the three years showed that the highest
  concentrations of redfish were found at the mouth of the Gulf, in NAFO
  Divisions 4T, 4Vn, and 4R. The summer GEAC grid survey catch rate index showed
  a decreasing trend between 1998 and 2000. The length frequency distributions
  for the redfish from the summer surveys (1998 to 2000) display two modes:
  between 13 and 19 cm, corresponding to the 1993-1995 year-classes, and between
  28 and 37 cm, dominated by the 1980 year-class. The continuation of the GEAC
  early-summer surveys should provide information that will be useful for better
  describing the distribution pattern of redfish and to extend the series of this
  new abundance when redflsh are more likely to be found in their summer
  geographic range in the Gulf. This index can be compared to the other abundance
  indices from surveys (DFO and Sentinel) conducted in the summer and fall.

AB: Aims: The aim of our study was to evaluate the usefulness and applicability
  of sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification in N0 carcinomas of the oral cavity
  and oropharynx, Study design: We carried out a prospective evaluation of SLN
  identification in 20 patients with oral cavity or oropharynx carcinomas with no
  clinical evidence of lymph node metastases. Methods: Peritumoral infiltration
  with technetium-99-labeled nanocolloid followed by lymphoscintigrapy was
  carried out approximately 1hours prior to surgery. A vital dye was injected
  intraoperatively and the SLN was identified with the aid of a gamma probe. All
  patients underwent routine neck dissection. Results: While multiple radioactive
  nodes were generally identified on lymphoscintigraphy, the number of nodes
  ranging from one to five with variable degrees of uptake, intraoperative gamma
  probe scanning allowed the identification of a single more radioactive lymph
  node in 19 of the 20 patients. In only one patient did this method lead to the
  identification of two equally highly radioactive SLNs, with no uptake in the
  remaining nodes. All SLNs were ipsilateral to the neoplastic lesion. In 15
  cases the SLN was tumor negative and so were the remaining nodes obtained by
  comprehensive neck dissection. In five cases the SLN was the only lymph node
  containing micrometastasis among those obtained by dissection. There were no
  instances of node positivity not involving the SLN. Conclusions: Sentinel lymph
  node identification in ENT surgery may indicate intraoperatively if node
  metastases are present, thereby avoiding overtreatment in a substantial
  proportion of patients with N0 carcinomas of the oral cavity or oropharynx.

AB: Intraoperative tumor detection has been used in many applications, and today
  the sentinel node technique is a widely employed surgical procedure in breast
  cancer. Different detector systems are employed but several problems have been
  reported in clinical practice, in particular the difficulty to accurately
  detect the sentinel node within the axillary soft tissue. The problem is even
  greater for abdominal and thoracic tumors. We propose an innovative Imaging
  Probe (IP) able to visualize on a monitor the primary tumor and secondary
  lesions, if appropriately radiolabeled. The IP can be optimally applied for
  minimally invasive surgery in breast cancer treatment, and a preliminary
  experience related to 15 patients and 20 sentinel nodes is reported here. We
  compared the results obtained with the IP to those obtained with an Anger
  camera and a traditional scintillation detector, and found them to be very
  promising. In particular the surgeon's work is greatly facilitated by direct
  visual guidance instead of a generic acoustic signal.

AB: Aims and background: Anal cancer is a rare condition. The inguinal lymph
  nodes are the most common site of metastasis in this neoplasm. The inguinal
  lymph node status is an important prognostic indicator and the presence of
  metastases is an independent prognostic factor for local failure and overall
  mortality. Depending on the primary tumor size and histological
  differentiation, metastasis to superficial inguinal lymph nodes occurs in 15
  -25% of cases. Methods and study design: To evaluate the inguinal lymph node
  status we performed a search for the sentinel node in a female patient affected
  by squamous anal carcinoma. Results: Identification and examination of the
  sentinel node was positive and postoperative histology showed the presence of
  bilateral lymph node metastases. Conclusions: We suggest that examination of
  the sentinel node in anal cancer could be an efficient way to establish the
  inguinal lymph node status, which would help the clinician to plan and perform
  adequate treatment.

AB: Aims and background: In the last ten years validation of the sentinel lymph
  node (SLN) concept has led to modification of the surgical approach for
  patients with intermediate-risk cutaneous melanoma. Methods and study design:
  Forty-eight patients affected by cutaneous melanoma with a Breslow thickness
  between 0.65 and 4 mm were enrolled in the study. Approximately 2 mCi of
  radiotracer and 1 mL of vital blue dye were injected in each patient around the
  site of the primary lesion. Lymphoscintigraphy was performed until the
  lymphatic basin and the respective SLN were localized. The whole surgical
  procedure consisted of enlargement of the surgical margins followed by
  localization and excision of the SLN(s) by using both radiotracer and vital
  dye. Whenever the SLN proved to be histologically positive for metastasis,
  complete regional lymphadenectomy was performed. Results: Within 15 minutes of
  radiotracer administration the lymphatic basin was localized in all 48 patients
  by lymphoscintigraphy. Vital dye and radiotracer successfully allowed SLN
  localization and excision in 46 of 48 patients (97%); in one case the SLN was
  detected by radiotracer alone. The SLN proved to be metastatic in six (13%) of
  46 evaluable patients; interestingly, in three of them the presence of
  metastatic cells was revealed only by immunohistochemistry. All patients with
  tumor-positive SLNs had primary lesions with a Breslow thickness=2 mm.
  Conclusions: Sentinel lymphadenectomy is able to identify lymph node
  involvement in patients with cutaneous melanoma with a Breslow thickness >1 mm,
  thus avoiding the risks associated with radical regional lymphadenectomy.
  Lymphoscintigraphy proved to be an important tool to obtain correct
  preoperative localization of the drainage basin, especially for melanomas
  located on the face and trunk.

AB: Aims and background: Sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) has recently been
  evaluated as a new staging technique for early breast cancer. To minimize the
  extent of surgery, the feasibility of eradicating primary breast lesions and
  the relative sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) under regional anesthesia was evaluated
  in this study. Methods and study design: A selected population of 76 patients
  with suspected operable breast cancer and no clinically palpable lymph nodes
  was enrolled in the study. Intra- and perilesional administration of a
  radiotracer was performed. Lymphoscintigraphy was carried out to confirm the
  drainage pathway and locate the SLN. The following day, after inducing a
  nervous block induction of the ipsilateral intercostal nerves, we performed the
  surgical procedure with the help of a hand-held gamma-detecting probe. In case
  the primary lesion was diagnosed as invasive carcinoma by frozen section, the
  SLN and the remaining axillary lymph nodes (non-SLNs) were removed. The status
  of SLN and non-SLNs was compared. Results: The primary breast lesion was
  located and excised in all cases (identification rate: 100%).
  Lymphoscintigraphy positively identified SLNs in 40/45 (89%) patients; in five
  patients no lymphatic drainage was detected. In 38 cases an average of 1.5 SLNs
  and 14 non-SLNs per patient were removed and pathologically analyzed; the
  remaining two patients showed SLNs in the internal mammary chain, which were
  not excised. Twenty-nine percent of the patients showed metastatic disease in
  the lymph nodes examined. Of all patients with affected nodes, 55% had cancer
  cells only in the SLN. No false negatives (skip metastases) were found. No
  immediate or long-term anesthesia-related complications (eg pleural lesions,
  intravascular injection) were observed. Conclusions: Our data confirm the
  feasibility of single radiotracer administration for both occult lesion and SLN
  localization as well as the usefulness of SLND in staging early breast cancer.
  Regional anesthesia resulted in easy management and good patient compliance.
  This time-saving procedure allowed the completion of the whole surgical plan,
  reducing the recovery time without modifying the effectiveness of surgery.

AB: Aims and background: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection is currently
  employed in patients with malignant melanoma (MM) to spare them unnecessary
  lymph node dissection. Methods and study design: We investigated 241 patients
  (130 men and 111 women, median age, 50 years (range, 14-92)) with MM (192
  before and 51 after surgical biopsy); two of them had more than one melanoma
  lesion. In each patient approx. 10 MBq of 99mTc Nanocoll in 0.1 mL (Nycomed
  Amersham Sorin; particle size range, 3-80 nm) was injected intradermally around
  the MM lesion or surgical scar. Dynamic acquisition was performed for 20
  minutes (20 frames/min) and the study was concluded within four hours of
  injection. Using an external radioactive marker, the skin over the SLN was
  marked with China ink. Results: 294 SLNs were scintigraphically identified: 117
  in the inguinal region, 147 in the axillae, four in the submandibular region,
  three in the laterocervical region and 23 at other sites. In two patients no
  drainage was detected. In 43 patients more than one sentinel node was
  identified. In 13 patients with lesions located in the trunk the tracer drained
  towards multiple lymph node stations or unexpected lymph nodes (nine cases).
  Histology and immunohistochemistry diagnosed MM in 25 SLNs; 19 were positive
  for metastasis with hematoxylin-eosin staining, five with Hmb45 and one with
  CD68 immunostaining. All 25 detected lymphatic basins were excised. In nine of
  these basins there was metastatic involvement of at least one other lymph node
  besides the SLN. During follow-up, which ranged from six to 86 months,
  metastatic disease was found in only one patient with a histologically negative
  SLN six months after surgery. Conclusions: This study confirms the utility of
  scintigraphic SLN detection in patients with MM. In most of the cases the
  procedure led the surgeon to evaluate the drainage area, which is unpredictable
  for lesions in the trunk and may be difficult to delineate using only patent
  blue dye. Furthermore, in approximately 10% of cases we observed dual drainage
  from individual lesions, mainly those located on the trunk. We will proceed to
  compare the results obtained during follow-up with those of an investigational
  group of patients with melanoma who were not subjected to lymphoscintigraphy
  for SLN detection in order to obtain well-founded information on the prognostic
  value of this technique.

AB: Aim: The aim of our study was to evaluate the role of scintigraphy in
  lymphatic mapping and in the identification of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) in
  patients with head and neck cancer. Methods: Between September 1999 and
  February 2001 we enrolled 22 consecutive patients with cancer in the head and
  neck region; five squamous cell carcinomas, one Merkel cell tumor of the cheek,
  and 16 malignant melanomas. Lymphoscintigraphy was performed three hours before
  surgery after injection of 30-50 MBq of 99mTc-Nanocoll in 0.3 mL; the dose was
  fractionated by injecting the radiotracer at two points around the lesion.
  Static acquisition (anterior and/or lateral views, 512X512 matrix, 5 mins pre
  -set time) was started immediately after the injections so as to visualize the
  pathways of lymphatic drainage. The skin projection of the SLN was marked with
  ink. Intraoperative SLN detection was performed with perilesional injection of
  patent blue. Results: SLNs were found with lymphoscintigraphy in all patients.
  Thirty-three SLNs were identified; one occipital node, three nodes at the base
  of the tongue, 10 superficial lateral nodes (external jugular), five
  submandibular nodes, five submental nodes, three mastoid nodes and six
  supraclavicular nodes. Biopsy was performed in 21/22 patients. In 20/22
  patients the first lymph nodes were visualized in the proximal cranial regions
  (retroauricular, jugular and submandibular) at five minutes post injection. The
  SLN positivity rate was 13.6% (three patients). All patients with tumor
  -positive SLNs were submitted to radical dissection. Poor concordance in the
  detection of sentinel nodes was observed with patent blue. Conclusions: The
  flow of nanocolloid in the lymph vessels of the head is rapid. In our
  experience immediate scintigraphic imaging was essential to visualize the
  pathways of lymphatic drainage and the first SLN. Radioguided SLN biopsy is
  therefore recommended within three hours. Injection of patent blue is
  inadvisable because of the poor concordance with lymphoscintigraphy and the
  risk of permanent tattooing of the face.

AB: A one-square-inch-field-of-view mini gamma camera, whose first prototype was
  built by us in 1998 and given the name imaging probe (IP), was initially
  employed in sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection. This is probably the best way
  of learning how to use it. In the present work IP was used for SLN localization
  by a medical team that, after having been trained by the group of nuclear
  physicians of "La Sapienza" University who designed and first used the
  detector, used IP at their own hospital to 1) acquire experience for future use
  during surgery (a cooperative project on IP-radioguided orthopedic surgery is
  ongoing) and 2) start multicenter trials with IP. The SLN was identified and
  localized with IP and a non-imaging probe, Neoprobe 2000, in six patients with
  breast cancer who underwent lymphoscintigraphy for SLN biopsy. The operators
  who used Neoprobe and IP were blinded to each other's findings and to the
  results obtained with the large-field-of-view Anger camera that was used for
  lymphoscintigraphy. The Anger camera, IP and Neoprobe detected seven SLNs in
  six patients. The mean detection time was 2 mins 6 s (standard deviation (SD)
  26 s) with IP, and 2 mins 18 s (SD 47 s) with Neoprobe 2000. The SLN that was
  most difficult to find was detected in 2 mins 56 s with IP and 3 mins 45 s with
  Neoprobe. The operators subjective impression of having detected the SLN was
  "absolutely sure" for 7/7 nodes with IP and "absolutely sure" for 5/7 nodes
  with Neoprobe.

AB: Aims and background: In stage I oral squamous cell carcinoma, clinical
  examination and imaging techniques are unable to identify 60-90% of patients at
  risk of micrometastasis, while the sentinel node biopsy technique allows to
  avoid the morbidity of elective neck dissection in patients not actually
  affected by micrometastases. Materials and methods: Forty-one T1-T2N0 patients
  underwent lymphoscintigraphy after peritumoral injection of human albumin
  labeled with 99Tc. Focal areas of radiotracer uptake were marked on the skin
  preoperatively. The sentinel lymph node (SLN) was identified by the combined
  use of blue dye and gamma probe and subsequently removed. Complete neck
  dissection was then performed in all patients and the histological findings
  were compared with those of SLN biopsy. Results: The SLN was identified in 95%
  of the patients; in four cases (10%) two SLNs were isolated. In 18% of our
  patients the SLNs were located outside the expected drainage area. When the
  histology of the negative SLNs was compared with the pathological status of the
  neck dissection specimens no false negatives were found. Five SLNs in four
  patients contained micrometastases and were the only positive lymph nodes.
  Conclusion: SLN biopsy can be a valuable staging technique in T1 and T2 oral
  cancer with uninvolved neck in patients whose lymphatic drainage of the neck
  has not been altered by previous surgery or radiotherapy. It provides reliable
  detection of micrometastasis, indicating which level(s) should be removed
  ipsilaterally or contralaterally, and allows the surgeon to accurately plan
  neck dissection, taking into consideration the pattern of lymphatic drainage of
  each individual patient. In this way unnecessary neck dissection and its
  morphofunctional sequelae can be avoided in a considerable number of patients.

AB: Aims and background: Following the widespread use of radioguided surgery
  (RGS) in melanoma and breast cancer, we applied this new surgical strategy to
  prostate cancer (PC). The aims of this study were 1) to evaluate the accuracy
  of RGS in the detection of prostatic sentinel lymph nodes (SLN), and 2) to
  verify if pelvic lymphadenectomy (LAD) is an accurate means to detect solitary
  micrometastases. Study design: We investigated 48 patients with PC confirmed by
  transrectal biopsy who underwent radical prostatectomy and bilateral LAD. A
  dose of 99mTc-labeled nanocolloid particles was injected into the prostate
  after needle positioning by ultrasonography. Serial imaging was obtained with a
  gamma camera, identifying 1) the first radioactive lymph node (sentinel lymph
  node, SLN); 2) other radioactive lymph nodes, and 3) non-active lymph nodes.
  Results: Forty-three SLNs were identified in 48 patients. Twenty SLNs were
  located at unusual sites with respect to the extent of conventional LAD. Five
  SLNs were positive for micrometastases and two of these were located outside
  the usual LAD area. No micrometastases were found in any of the remaining lymph
  nodes (active and non-active). Conclusions: These preliminary results are in
  agreement with the few previous scientific contributions available on this
  topic and indicate that it is possible to reduce the extent and duration of
  surgery and necessary to reevaluate the conventional sites of lymphatic
  drainage.

AB: Aims and background: The aims of this study were 1) to investigate whether
  sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy could become the method of choice for the
  early detection of metastatic disease in patients with malignant melanoma and
  2) to identify those patients with lymph node metastases who could benefit from
  regional lymphadenectomy. Methods and study design: Our study started in March
  1998 and involved 110 patients with primary cutaneous malignant melanoma stage
  I or II (AJCC) in whom the primary lesion had been surgically removed no more
  than 90 days previously. On the day of lymph node dissection patients were
  given an intradermal injection of colloid particles of human serum albumin
  labeled with technetium-99m and an injection of isosulfan blue. The surgical
  procedure was usually performed with local anesthesia but in some cases
  locoregional or general anesthesia was preferred. Contralateral and ipsilateral
  lymphatic areas were scanned with a hand-held gamma camera (Scintiprobe MR 100)
  to measure the background and identify the hot point indicating the location of
  the sentinel node to direct the incision. Results: The combined use of
  lymphoscintigraphy, isosulfan blue and gamma probe allowed us to identify
  sentinel nodes in 108 of 110 patients (98.18%) while the SLN was blue in only
  90 cases (81.81%). The SLN was positive for metastases in 13 of the 108
  patients (12.03%) and regional and distal lymphadenectomy was performed in all
  of them. The distribution of positive SLNs by primary lesion thickness was as
  follows: 0.76-1.5 mm: one positive SLN/44 patients (2.27%); 1.51-4 mm: six
  positive SLNs/51 patients (11.7%); >4 mm: six positive SLNs/15 patients (40%).
  Only four of 12 patients with ulcerated cutaneous melanoma had positive SLNs.
  The patients in our study underwent follow-up visits every four months. The
  median follow-up was 481 days (range, 97-1271 days). Conclusions: In patients
  with primary cutaneous melanoma the histological status of the SLN accurately
  reflects the presence or absence of metastatic disease in the relevant regional
  lymph node basin. Complete lymph node dissection should only be performed in
  patients with positive SLNs. Patients with lesions >4 mm are likely to develop
  recurrences and to die of systemic disease, so in these patients the usefulness
  of SLN biopsy is questionable. In conclusion, sentinel node mapping is a
  rational approach for the selection of patients who might benefit from early
  lymph node dissection of the affected basin.

AB: Aims and background: The presence of lymph node metastases in patients with
  cutaneous melanoma represents the basis for correct therapy planning and is the
  most powerful prognostic factor to evaluate overall survival at diagnosis.
  Methods and study design: Since 1992, when Dr Morton published his first
  experience, the sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy technique seems to have
  resolved this matter by correctly staging patients. We analyzed our data from
  240 SLN biopsies performed in the last five years at the National Cancer
  Institute of Naples, evaluating the total identification rate and the nodal
  recurrence rate, and compared them with the preliminary data of the MSLT
  (melanoma sentinel lymph node trial). Results: Of all SLNs evaluated 18.5% were
  micrometastatic and 14% were identified by immunohistochemical staining. Forty
  -one patients had metastatic SLNs and nodal dissection of the positive basins
  revealed no other tumor-positive lymph nodes in more than 80% of them. All
  patients with a Breslow thickness of less than 2 mm had micrometastases only in
  the SLN, while with increasing thickness two, three or more positive nodes were
  found. Among SLN-negative patients nine (4%) developed lymph node recurrence in
  the previously treated basin and were therefore considered as false negative
  SLN biopsies. Conclusions: The prognostic value of SLN biopsy needs to be
  confirmed by the final results of the MSLT evaluating the therapeutic use of
  this procedure in patients with a Breslow thickness of less than 2 mm and its
  possible impact on the course of the disease.

AB: Aims and background: The standard procedure for the evaluation of axillary
  nodal involvement in patients with breast cancer is still complete lymph node
  dissection. However, about 70% of patients are found to be free of metastatic
  disease while axillary node dissection may cause significant morbidity.
  Lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy are changing this
  situation. Methods and study design: In a period of 18 months we studied 201
  patients with breast cancer, excluding patients with palpable axillary nodes,
  tumors >2.5 cm in diameter, multifocal or multicentric cancer, pregnant
  patients and patients over 80 years of age. Before surgery 99mTc-labeled
  colloid and vital blue dye were injected into the breast to identify the SLN.
  In lymph nodes dissected during surgery the metastatic status was examined by
  sections at reduced intervals. Only patients with SLNs that were histologically
  positive for metastases underwent axillary dissection. Results: We localized
  one or more SLNs in 194 of 201 (96.5%) patients; when both techniques were
  utilized the success rate was 100%. Histologically, 21% of patients showed SLN
  metastases (7.8% micrometastases) and 68% of these had metastases also in other
  axillary nodes. None of the patients with negative SLNs developed metastases
  during follow-up. Conclusions: At present there is no definite evidence that
  negative SLN biopsy is invariably correlated with negative axillary status;
  however, our study and those of others demonstrate that SLN biopsy is an
  accurate method of axillary staging.

AB: Aims and background: Intraoperative lymphatic mapping and sentinel node
  (SLN) biopsy have generated a tremendous amount of interest and are already
  established as part of the standard practice in the surgical management of
  breast cancer and melanoma. To reduce extensive radical procedures and decrease
  the morbidity in the treatment of gynecologic malignancies, much effort is
  being made to use less aggressive interventions. The purpose of our study was
  to determine the feasibility of SLN mapping in a group of patients with
  endometrial cancer at early stages. Method and study design: Between September
  2000 and May 2001 11 patients with endometrial cancer FIGO stage Ib (n=10) and
  IIa (n=1) underwent laparoscopic SLN detection during laparoscopy-assisted
  vaginal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and bilateral
  systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy. Radioactive isotope injection was performed
  24 hours before surgery and blue dye injection was performed just before
  surgery in the cervix at 3, 6, 9 and 12 hours. A 350 mm laparoscopic gamma
  scintyprobe MR 100 type 11. 99mTc settled (Pol Hi Tech), was used
  intraoperatively for SLN detection. Results: Seventeen (17) SLNs were detected
  with lymphoscintigraphy (six bilateral and five unilateral). At laparoscopic
  surgery we found the same locations belonging at internal iliac lymph nodes
  (the so-called Lebeuf-Godard area, lateral to the inferior vesical artery,
  ventral to the origin of the uterine artery and medial or caudal to the
  external iliac vein). Fourteen (14) SLNs were negative on histological analysis
  and three were positive for micrometastases (mean SLN sections=60). All other
  pelvic lymph nodes were negative at histological analysis. The same SLN
  locations detected with the gamma scintyprobe were observed at laparoscopy
  after patent blue dye injection. Conclusions: Our preliminary data suggest that
  combined 99mTc-labeled colloid and vital blue-dye techniques are feasible for
  SLN detection in endometrial cancer; they represent a very promising tool to
  transform the management of early-stage endometrial cancer. The clinical
  validity of this combined technique should be evaluated prospectively.

AB: Aims and background: Peritumoral injection of 99mTc-labeled colloids for
  lymphoscintigraphy and radioguided surgery does not entail any relevant
  radiation burden to the patients. The real issue about radiation protection
  concerns the personnel involved in the procedure besides the nuclear medicine
  personnel. The aim of our study was to evaluate the cumulative doses to
  personnel involved during the injection of radiolabeled compounds under
  ultrasound or stereotactic guidance and the radiation burden to the personnel
  involved in the surgical incision of the tumor 24 hours after the
  administration of 99mTc-labeled colloids. Methods and study design: We
  performed environmental contamination tests (SMEAR TEST) and exposure
  evaluation in the operating room. Results: In the operating room the removed
  activity in the analyzed samples was less than 0.5 Bq/g and exposure to the
  personnel was less than 6muSv/h. The evaluations made during ultrasound
  guidance demonstrated an equivalent and effective dose less than 20muSv.
  Conclusions: Our results show that during ultrasound or stereotactic
  administration of radiolabeled compounds the radiation burden to the personnel
  involved in the procedure is virtually negligible. The surgeons too are exposed
  to a negligible radiation dose.

AB: Aims and background: In patients with breast cancer the presence of internal
  mammary chain (IMC) metastases changes tumor staging, and the occurrence of IMC
  drainage is quite common in breast cancer. Nevertheless, IMC dissection is not
  a routine procedure in modern surgical approaches towards breast cancer. We
  therefore need minimally invasive techniques for accurate assessment of the IMC
  nodal basin. The aim of this study was to investigate whether sentinel node
  biopsy (SLNB) could offer a solution. Methods and study design: From November
  1997 to June 2001 143 female patients who were eligible for breast cancer
  surgery were included in the study. All patients had T1 breast cancer and
  clinically negative axillae. Patients were submitted to preoperative
  lymphoscintigraphy with subsequent SLNB. We used a 99m-technetium nanocolloid
  tracer (Nanocoll(R)) that was injected peritumorally so as to have about 10 MBq
  of radioactivity at the time of surgery. Scintigraphy was performed about 17
  hours after tracer administration. During surgery, lymphoscintigraphic imaging
  and a gamma ray detection probe were used to locate the sentinel node.
  Histological examination after embedding in paraffin was usually requested and
  multilevel sectioning of the sentinel node (SLN) was performed, with
  hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry. Results: Preoperative
  lymphoscintigraphy localized SLNs in the IMC basin in 27 of 143 patients
  (18.9%). Harvesting of IMC-SLNs based on lymphoscintigraphy results was
  successful in 20 of 27 patients (74.1 %). Histological examination revealed
  micrometastases in four of the 20 harvested nodes. One of these patients showed
  no axillary drainage and no axillary lymph node dissection was therefore
  performed. In the remaining three patients also axillary SLNs were harvested,
  which turned out be free from metastatic involvement. Conclusions: In our
  experience lymphoscintigraphy with SLNB was an accurate method to detect IMC
  metastases in patients with breast cancer. We recommend peritumoral tracer
  injection and a reasonable interval between injection and scintigraphy. IMC-SLN
  biopsy did not result in any serious additional complications or morbidity. In
  our study this approach led to improved cancer staging: four of 20 harvested
  IMC-SLNs proved to be micrometastatic. None of these four patients had
  metastatic axillary SLNs. Exclusive drainage to the IMC is present in only a
  small number of breast cancer patients, and our results suggest that it is
  possible to avoid unnecessary axillary node dissection in such cases.

AB: Aims and background: Locoregional lymph node status is one of the most
  important prognostic factors determining the need for adjuvant chemotherapy in
  patients with breast cancer. Many authors have reported that micrometastases
  were not detected by routine sectioning of lymph nodes but were identified by
  multiple sectioning and additional staining. Among lymph node-negative patients
  15-20% had an unfavorable outcome at five years from primary surgery. Sentinel
  lymph node (SLN) biopsy is an accurate technique for identifying axillary
  metastases because the pathologist utilizes hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) staining
  together with immunohistochemistry (IH) to examine all lymph node sections.
  Sentinel node micrometastasis has therefore become an important tumor-related
  prognostic factor. Methods and study design: From November 1997 to October 2001
  we examined in 210 patients the pathological features of primary breast lesions
  and SLN metastases and we correlated these with the tumor status of non-SLNs in
  the same axillary basin. We applied IH examination to both SLNs and non-SLNs of
  patients who were negative for metastasis by standard H-E examination. Results:
  In this study lymph node staging was based on SLN findings, primary tumor size,
  and the presence of peritumoral lymphovascular invasion (LVI). We found 18 SLN
  micrometastases (9%) in 210 patients and one of these (5.5% of patients with
  SLN micrometastasis) also had one non-SLN metastasis: this patient had LVI and
  a larger primary tumor than patients with SLN micrometastasis without non-SLN
  metastasis. We also found 24 SLN macrometastases (11.5%) in 210 patients and 13
  of these (54.2% of patients with SLN macrometastases) had one or more non-SLN
  metastases. Conclusions: According to the results reported in the literature,
  tumor cells are unlikely to be found in non-SLNs when the primary lesion is
  small and SLN involvement micrometastatic (5.5% in our experience, 7% in
  Giuliano's). Our findings suggest that axillary lymph node dissection may not
  be necessary in patients with SLN micrometastasis from T1 lesions.

AB: Separate controlled trials were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of two
  formulations of moxidectin (1% non-aqueous injectable solution and 0.5% pour-on
  (Cydectin(R))) against larval or adult stages of Oesophagostomum radiatum and
  Trichuris discolor infecting cattle. Fifty-three strongylate-free dairy breed
  steer calves were obtained from commercial sources. After a brief acclimation
  period, calves were randomly divided into two pools to evaluate the efficacy of
  the moxidectin formulations against targeted larval (n = 27 calves) or adult (n
  = 26 calves) parasites. Calves in the larvacidal trial were inoculated on Day -
  16 relative to treatment with approximately 1000 embryonated Trichuris spp.
  eggs and approximately 640 infective Oesophagostomum spp. larvae. Calves were
  allocated by lottery to one of three treatment groups (n = 8 per group), which
  included: Group 1-moxidectin 0.5% pour-on (0.5 mg/kg body weight (BW)) applied
  topically; Group 2-moxidectin 1% non-aqueous injectable (0.2 mg/kg BW)
  administered subcutaneously; Group 3-untreated controls. Treatments were
  administered on Day 0 and calves were housed by group with no contact among
  animals of different treatments. Three sentinel calves were necropsied on Day 0
  of the larvacidal trial to assess viability of larval inocula. On Days 14, 15
  and 16 after treatment, calves were euthanatized (two or three from each group
  per day) and samples of gut contents were collected for determination of total
  worm counts. On Day -63 relative to treatment, calves in the adulticidal
  efficacy trial were inoculated with approximately 1000 embryonated Trichuris
  eggs and then on Day -35 with approximately 2500 infective Oesophagostomum spp.
  larvae. Fecal samples were collected on Day -7 and the 24 calves with the
  highest egg counts were assigned by lottery to the following three treatment
  groups (n = 8 per group): Group 4-moxidectin 0.5% pour-on; Group 5-moxidectin
  1% injectable; Group 6-untreated controls. Details of experimental treatments,
  calf housing and necropsy scheduling were similar to the larvacidal trial. In
  both the larvacidal and adulticidal trials, inocula contained a variety of
  parasites in addition to the targeted species. Based on geometric means, both
  moxidectin 0.5% pour-on and moxidectin 1% non-aqueous injectable significantly
  reduced (P < 0.05) numbers of Oesophagostomum spp. and Trichuris spp. with
  anthelmintic efficacies of >99% when used against adult or larval stages of
  infection. In addition, both formulations of moxidectin demonstrated >95%
  efficacy (P < 0.05) against larval stages of Strongyloides papillosus. The pour
  -on formulation had >97% adulticidal and larvacidal efficacy against Cooperia
  spp. females, while the injectable product was effective against female
  Cooperia spp. larvae and Cooperia oncophora adult males.

AB: Background. The sentinel node biopsy has been established as a standard
  procedure in many types of cancer. To date, only one case was reported for
  successful detection of the sentinel node using a radiopharmaceutical-directed
  mapping technique in malignant melanoma of the vagina. Case. An 81-year-old
  woman developed malignant melanoma arising from the lower third of the vagina.
  She underwent local resection of the tumor and exploration of the sentinel node
  using blue dye. The sentinel node was detected successfully in the groin, and
  was negative for metastasis. Intra-cavity irradiation was given as an adjuvant
  therapy. Conclusion. In view of relative ease and minimal trauma, sentinel node
  mapping could be a routine procedure in malignant melanoma arising from the
  vagina or vulva.

AB: Objective. The aim of this study was to describe the first sentinel groin
  node metastasis detected by technetium-labeled nannocolloid in a patient with
  cervical carcinoma. Method. Preoperatively, 60 mBq technetium-labeled
  nannocolloid was injected at 3 and 9 o'clock in the uterine cervix. Sentinel
  nodes were detected using a handheld and laparoscopic probe (Navigator) and
  removed for pathological assessment. Results. A 52-year-old diagnosed with FIGO
  stage IIA squamous cervical carcinoma was referred to our unit. On physical
  examination a bulky cervical tumor and a 1.5-cm enlarged left inguinal lymph
  node were found. No other abnormalities were seen on pelvic MRI scan and CT
  scan of the abdomen and lower pelvis. Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy showed
  that a left groin node and three nodes located in the right obturator fossa
  were the sentinel nodes. They were easily detected using, respectively, a hand
  -held and a laparoscopic probe and removed. As both the inguinal and the
  obturator lymph nodes contained metastatic deposits, the patient was treated
  with the combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Conclusion. Inguinal
  lymph nodes can rarely be the sentinel nodes in patients with cancer of the
  uterine cervix.

AB: Background. Metastasis of malignant breast cells is in part mediated through
  degradation of the extracellular matrix by proteolysis, enabling malignant
  cells to migrate through the surrounding stroma. Heparanase-1 (HPR1) is an
  endoglycosidase that specifically degrades the heparan sulfate (HS) moiety of
  proteoglycans, a component of the extracellular matrix and basement membrane.
  Methods. Fifty-one primary breast tumors, 13 lymph node metastases, 4 ductal
  carcinoma in situ, 7 benign, and 5 normal specimens were examined for HPR1
  expression using immunohistochemical staining. The functional role of HPR1
  expression was determined by examining HS deposition using immunofluorescence
  staining. Results. Sixteen of 30 breast carcinomas (53%) with sentinel node
  metastasis expressed HPR1. In contrast, only 5 of 21 nonmetastatic primary
  breast carcinomas (23%) were HPR1 positive. Eighteen of 30 breast carcinomas
  between 1 and 5 cm expressed HPR1, compared with 3 of 21 HPR1-positive
  specimens in tumors ltoreq 1 cm. Statistical analysis revealed that HPR1
  expression was associated with breast tumor metastases (P = .04) and primary
  tumors between 1 and 5 cm (P = .002). Ninety percent of HPR1-positive tumors
  lacked HS deposition, suggesting an inverse correlation between HPR1 expression
  and HS deposition. Conclusions. HPR1 expression correlates with the lack of HS
  deposition and with the metastatic potential of breast cancers. The frequency
  of HPR1 is significantly higher in breast tumors between 1 and 5 cm than in
  tumors ltoreq 1 cm.

AB: The effects of air quality with three levels of ozone (O3) were studied on
  three cabbage varieties during a one month exposure period in the Valencia area
  by means of modulated chlorophyll (Chl) a fluorescence, lipid peroxidation and
  solute leakage. Increasing O3 exposure reduced the maximum quantum yield of
  PSII photochemistry (Fv/Fm) in line with a reduction in non-cyclic electron
  flow (phiPSII), lower capacity to reduce the quinone pool (qP) and a decrease
  in the potential phothosynthetic quantum conversion, Rfd ratio. These
  reductions were more evident in Caramba and Sentinel varieties but lower in
  Othelo. Ozone and its oxidative derivates weakened the plasmalemma, which
  caused a leakage of cellular liquids into intercellular spaces. In our results,
  the ion leakage increased with O3 concentration. Moreover, data from
  thiobarbituric acid reactive (TBARS) analysis confirmed the hypothesis that O3
  modified the membrane structure by increasing the lipid peroxidation more in
  Caramba and Sentinel varieties. These alterations in the membranes reduced the
  ability to develop non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). The O3 effects on solute
  leakage and lipid peroxidation in the Othelo variety were lower than in the
  other two varieties, which allowed non-photochemical quenching to develop in
  this variety. These results suggest the possibility adverse effects of ozone on
  winter crops grown in the Valencia region.

AB: The purpose of the present study was to determine the prevalence of
  antibiotic resistance, with special attention to vancomycin, in 104 strains of
  Enterococcus, which is the sentinel bacterium isolated from dog and cat faeces
  samples. The phenotypic characterization of the isolates classified them as E.
  faecium (58%), E. avium (41%) and E. faecalis (1%). Sensitivity testing used
  the diffusion method according to the recommendations of CASFM (Comite de
  l'Antibiogramme de la Societe Francaise de Microbiogie), to oxacillin,
  amoxycillin, amoxycilin + clavulanic acid, ampicillin, piperacillin,
  cefoperazone, imipenem, enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, nalidixic acid,
  tetracycline, lincomycin, erythromicin and vancomycin. Minimum inhibitory
  concentration (MIC) determination by E test revealed a MIC to vancomycin of
  between 0.5 mug/ml and 3 mug/ml. All the strains were resistant to nalidixic
  acid, erythromycin, cefoperazone and oxacillin. We detected resistance to
  amoxycillin + clavulanic acid in 1.9% of isolates, to amoxycillin in 4.8%, to
  piperacillin in 13.5%, and to ampicillin in 21.2% of strains. A high prevalence
  of antibiotic resistance to lincomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin,
  ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin was found in 98.1%, 95.2%, 76.9%, 73.1% and 64.4%
  of strains, respectively. Resistance to vancomycin was not found, which
  indicates that there is no transmission risk of vancomycin-resistant
  enterococcal strains to man or transfer of their resistance genes to other
  bacteria belonging to the endogenous flora of humans.

AB: Background. The nodal status remains the most important prognostic factor in
  breast cancer. While evaluation of the axillary lymph nodes remains a standard
  of practice, evaluation of the internal mammary lymph nodes is no longer
  routinely performed. In the era of extensive radical mastestomies, it was shown
  that up to 40% of breast cancer patients had nodal metastases in the internal
  mammary chain. This resulted in up to 10% of presumed "node-negative" patients
  actually being node-positive when the internal mammary nodes were examined. In
  the era of sentinel node biopsies, hot internal mammary nodes on
  lymphoscintigraphy are sometimes encountered and confusion exists regarding the
  appropriate approach to these nodes. New advances in endoscopic surgery have
  enabled a minimally invasive approach to the mediastinum. The aim of this study
  was to evaluate the feasibility of thoracoscopic internal mammary sentinel node
  biopsy in an animal model. Materials and methods. Five farm pigs were injected
  with isosulphan blue under the right upper nipple. After a sentinel node was
  identified, it was dissected thoracoscopically. Results. In all the animals, an
  internal mammary blue node was easily identified 1-5 min after the injection
  and dissected with thoracoscopic instruments without significant damage to
  other thoracic structures. The procedure length averaged 30 to 60 min.
  Conclusions. Thoracoscopic internal mammary sentinel node biopsies are
  feasible, short, easy to perform, minimally invasive, and well focused toward a
  sentinel node. Well-planned phase I studies should be initiated to further
  evaluate this new technique.

AB: Objective: To provide community-level public health surveillance information
  on cannabis and Mandrax (methaqualone) use and associated health and social
  consequences. Design: A descriptive, epidemiological study of cannabis and
  Mandrax supply and demand indicators based on data gathered from multiple
  sources, including specialist treatment centres, trauma units, police records,
  and quantitative and qualitative studies of school students, sex workers,
  persons attending rave clubs, and arrestees. Networks were established at five
  sentinel sites to facilitate the collection, interpretation, and dissemination
  of data. Results: Supply and demand indicators point to the widespread use of
  cannabis and Mandrax and significant increases in white pipe-related health and
  social problems. There has been an increase in the demand for treatment related
  to cannabis/Mandrax use, a high proportion of patients in trauma units who test
  positive for cannabis and/or Mandrax, and a high proportion of cannabis and
  Mandrax-positive arrestees. Although the use of cannabis is predominantly a
  male phenomenon and is widespread among young people, it occurs in all sectors
  of South African society. Mandrax users tend to be young, male, and coloured.
  Conclusions: Cannabis and Mandrax use has a number of implications for health
  and social policy, including the need to develop protocols for the
  identification and management of cannabis/Mandrax-positive trauma patients and
  arrestees. The study points to the need for further monitoring of cannabis and
  Mandrax use and the negative consequences associated with their use.

AB: Objective: To determine the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus
  infection among male patients with sexually transmitted disease in Kuwait with
  emphasis on the type of sexually transmitted diseases and sexual partners.
  Method: A sentinel surveillance was conducted among male sexually transmitted
  disease patients, randomly selected among all new sexually transmitted disease
  patients who visited the Family Planning Clinic during June 1996 to June 1997.
  The patient data was recorded by the attending physician on a specially
  designed questionnaire. Results: A total of 1984 subjects were screened, out of
  which not a single human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency
  syndrome case was found. Among the screened, 69% were non-Kuwaitis. Most of the
  subjects (76%) belonged to the age group 15-34 years, were married (53%), were
  illiterate (37.5%) and belonged to the low SES group (70%). The most common
  sexually transmitted diseases were non-specific urethritis (45%) and gonorrhea
  (42%). With regard to sexual practices, the majority of the respondents showed
  preference for female prostitutes, both inside (50%) and outside (48%) Kuwait.
  Conclusion: The absence of any human immunodeficiency virus positive case was
  probably due to the mandatory screening for granting residency in Kuwait,
  facilitating early detection of virus carriers among non-Kuwaitis. We, as
  researchers, are not sure if this study is true representation of human
  immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome prevalence among
  Kuwaiti sexually transmitted disease patients in this country who might seek
  treatment in private clinics. Moreover, the absence of prostitution as
  professional trade also tends to show the absence of indigenous circulation of
  the virus. Nevertheless, continuos surveillance is necessary to maintain and
  prevent the groups with risky behaviors from contracting the virus through
  sexual transmission. There is a distinct need to develop public education and
  awareness programs to serve as measures of prevention and protection.

AB: Localization of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) in digestive cancers was
  performed mainly for colorectal primaries and less frequently for oeso-gastric
  primaries. This technique is feasible in vivo or ex vivo, with a vital dye
  and/or with a radiolabeled marker. Technically, detection reliability is good,
  provided a few simple rules are respected. Such intra-operative mapping leads
  to the localization of unusual lymphatic spread in 5% of the cases and initial
  resection can be adapted accordingly. "Sophisticated" histological analysis of
  one SLN, considered negative after a standard pathological examination, leads
  to three types of additional analyses: scrutiny of multiple serial slices whose
  prognostic significance is unequivocal when positive, and immunohistochemistry
  or gene amplification (RT-PCR) to search for circulating cancer cells whose
  prognostic value is currently uncertain. In the future, the localization and
  analysis of one SLN could supplant the classic examination of all lymph nodes.
  If the SLN is proven disease free, only very limited and microinvasive
  resections would be required to treat some digestive cancers with a curative
  intent.

AB: The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of sentinel
  node frozen biopsy to minimize the extensive pelvic lymph nodes dissection in
  early stage cervical cancer patients on the basis that the risk of skip
  metastasis to the paraaortic area is negligible. Twenty-six patients with early
  stage cervical cancer were enrolled in this study. Technetium-99m colloid
  albumin (Tc99m) was injected intradermally around the tumor for allowing
  preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and intraoperative hand-held gama probe
  detection of seninel nodes. For visual detection, isosulfan blue dye was
  injected into the peritumoral sites before peritoneal opening. Postoperative
  morbidity and negative predictive value were the endpoints of this study. The
  26 patients, ranging in age from 32 to 71 yr, underwent intraoperative sentinel
  nodes mapping. All the patients underwent complete pelvic lymph nodes
  dissection including para-aortic nodes. There was one case with positive non
  -sentinel nodes despite the negative sentinel node by frozen biopsy (negative
  predictive value, 95.2%). This new technique of sentinel node mapping is safe
  and simple to perform. Further clinical trials using the combination of Tc99m
  and isosulfan blue dye are warranted and this technique will make a true
  advance for less aggressive management of patients with early stage cervical
  cancer.

AB: The microsporidian species Encephalitozoon cuniculi can infect a wide
  variety of mammals including man. It is a common parasite in rabbits and
  several sporadic infections in laboratory rats have been described. Based on
  molecular data three E. cuniculi strains have been identified. Here we describe
  the first in vitro propagation of E. cuniculi, which was isolated from a free
  -ranging rat (Rattus norvegicus). The rat was one of three seropositive animals
  among 23 rats captured in the city of Zurich. The new isolate was further
  characterised as strain II ("mouse"-strain) based on the rDNA internal
  transcribed spacer sequence. Western blot analysis of this isolate revealed
  slight differences to other available strain II isolates originating from
  laboratory mice and farmed blue foxes. The new isolate caused disseminated
  infection in liver and lung upon oral inoculation of Brown Norway (BN) rats and
  was transmitted to sentinel rats. This rat-adapted isolate will be valuable to
  study the pathogenesis of Encephalitozoon infections in the rat model.

AB: Objectives: To determine the clinical value of sentinel lymph node (SLN)
  detection by lymphoscintigraphy and gamma ray detecting probe (GDP) and to
  assess the value of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining combined with
  immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis for detecting micrometastasis in lymph
  nodes (LNs). Methods: Forty-two patients with breast cancer were included in
  this study. 99Tcm-dextran was injected peritumourally. Lymphoscintigraphy
  images were obtained in anterior and lateral views. SLNs were removed with the
  aid of GDP during surgery. A standard axillary lymph nodes (ALNS) dissection
  was performed. All lymph nodes were first analyzed by HE staining. When all of
  the SLNs in a patient were negative, the ALNs were subjected to additional HE
  staining combined with IHC analysis. Results: SLNs were successfully detected
  and removed in 39 (92.9%) of the 42 patients. The sensitivity, specificity and
  accuracy of SLN biopsy were 92.9% (13 in 14), 100% (25 in 25) and 97.4% (38 in
  39) respectively. Additional HE staining combined with IHC analysis of the ALNs
  detected micrometastasis in 3 SLNs (2 cases), but there were no positives in
  the non-sentinal lymph nodes (NSLNs). Conclusions: This study suggests that
  lymphoscintigraphy and GDP may be used to detect SLN. Additional HE staining
  combined with IHC analysis of the ALNs may help predict micrometastasis. Biopsy
  of SLN may be an accurate method for staging breast cancer.

AB: Aims: To (1) describe the South African Community Epidemiology Network on
  Drug Use (SACENDU), (2) describe trends and associated consequences of alcohol
  and other drug (AOD) use in South Africa for January 1997 to December 1999 and
  (3) outline selected policy implications identified by SACENDU participants.
  Methods: A descriptive epidemiological study of AOD indicators based on data
  gathered from multiple sources, including specialist treatment centres, trauma
  units and quantitative studies of target groups such as school students and
  arrestees. Networks were established in five sentinel sites to facilitate the
  collection, interpretation and dissemination of data. Results: Over time
  alcohol has been the most frequently reported primary substance of abuse across
  sites. Trauma and psychiatric data highlight the burden associated with alcohol
  abuse. Cannabis and Mandrax (methaqualone), alone or in combination, are the
  most frequently reported illicit drugs of abuse, generally comprising the
  largest proportions of drug-related arrests, drug-related psychiatric diagnoses
  and drug-positive trauma patients. From 1997 to 1999, a significant increase in
  indicators for cocaine/crack and heroin occurred in two sites. Ecstasy (MDMA)
  use, alone or in combination with other substances, is reported among young
  people. Conclusions: A broad range of globally abused substances is present in
  South Africa and the use and burden of illicit substances appears to be
  increasing. This points to the importance of ongoing monitoring of AOD trends.
  Through regular, systematic data collection the SACENDU project has made
  available more evidence-based information to direct AOD abuse policy and
  practice and has had an impact on research agendas.

AB: Growing concern exists about the threats posed by environmental pollutants
  and physical agents on children's health. A number of factors, including
  globalization, increased industrialization, and trade of chemicals and poverty
  have an impact on the quality of the environment and on children's health.
  Acute toxic exposures lead to poisoning, and chronic low-level exposures may
  cause functional and organ damage during periods of special vulnerability. The
  need to protect children's environmental health is urgent, in view of the
  magnitude of the problem and the fact that "children are not little adults."
  The effects suffered during special developmental periods - "windows of
  vulnerability" - can be permanent and irreversible. The main global
  environmental problems affecting children's health are lack of access to safe
  drinking water and sanitation and exposure to indoor air pollution.
  Furthermore, environmentally related accidents, injuries, and poisonings have a
  major impact on children and adolescent's morbidity and mortality. A number of
  examples that illustrate the complexity of assessing and dealing with
  children's environmental health issues are presented. A Task Force on the
  Protection of Children's Environmental Health that aims to prevent disease and
  disability in children associated with chemical and physical threats was set up
  in 1999 by the World Health Organization. The priorities for action include the
  consideration of accidents, injuries, and poisonings (accidental, intentional,
  and occupational), and children in the workplace (e.g., scavenging children,
  children in cottage industries). Poisons Centers and related toxicology centers
  are in a strategic position to play a "sentinel" role in the protection of
  children's environmental health. They record acute and chronic toxic exposures
  in children in a harmonized manner, using controlled vocabularies and
  definitions. This will allow collecting a large, highly valuable database on
  the main toxicological problems affecting children, including those of
  environmental origin. The analysis of observations entered in such a database
  will help assess the burden of disease and collect the evidence for planning
  prevention and promoting regulatory measures. Centers are called to play a
  proactive role in raising awareness about children's environmental health and
  contribute to research, information dissemination, training, and other
  activities required for the protection of children's health and development.

AB: Background: There are still open questions about the safety of fragrances.
  Objectives: To evaluate the evidence concerning the frequency of contact
  dermatitis to fragrances in the general population and selected subgroups and
  the risk factors for sensitization and clinical manifestations. Methods: Review
  of published data. Results: No criteria for a reliable diagnosis of 'contact
  dermatitis' are available. International recommendations and standardization
  for patch test methods exist; however, the question whether agents that are
  positive are causally linked to contact dermatitis remain fraught with
  uncertainties concerning false-positive rates and clinical relevance. Most of
  the discussion concerning prevalence or incidence variations of allergic
  contact dermatitis to fragrances concentrate on the frequency of positive patch
  tests in clinical series, i.e. 'floating numerators'. Conclusions: Risk
  assessment requires that data from different sources are integrated and
  compared. Both a 'sentinel surveillance' system and more refined
  epidemiological studies in well-defined populations are needed to reliably
  assess the risks associated with fragrance exposure.

AB: We describe HIV-1 incidence and the prevalence of genetic subtypes among
  cocaine users in Sao Paulo, Brazil. A cross-sectional HIV-1 survey was carried
  out among 839 current cocaine users attending seven drug treatment units in the
  Sao Paulo metropolitan area from 1997 to 1998. HIV-1 subtyping was performed
  among 41 positive individuals using the heteroduplex mobility assay and DNA
  sequencing. Participants were mainly male (95.7%) with a history of previous
  imprisonment (54%), and the mean age was 26.9 years (SD = 7.2). The majority
  (64.4%) were current crack cocaine users, and 82.1% of the total participants
  were noninjectors. HIV-1 seroprevalence was 4.9% (95% confidence interval (CI),
  3.6%-6.6%), and the incidence (estimated by the sensitive/less-sensitive
  immunoassay testing strategy) was 0.71% per year (95% CI, 0.07-3.03). HIV-1
  subtype B was predominant (90.3%), followed by subtype F. There was no
  statistically significant association between HIV-1 subtype and specific route
  of drug administration. Our incidence data show evidence of recent HIV-1
  transmission among cocaine users, mainly among noninjectors. Detection of
  recently infected HIV-1 cases linked to genetic diversity analysis may provide
  baseline information for public health interventions in this sentinel group.

AB: In the new Japanese control law for infectious diseases, most varieties of
  acute viral encephalitis belong to Category IV requiring report of all cases at
  sentinel hospitals. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) encephalitis comprises
  the majority of cases. With the increased prevalence of diagnostic procedures
  such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), several forms of HSV-1, and -2 central
  nervous system (CNS) infections, including acute disseminated
  encephalomyelitis, brainstem encephalitis, and myelitis, have been clarified.
  Since 1990 we have conducted a survey of HSV CNS infections in the Kyushu and
  Okinawa regions, and the data are reviewed here. Trends include an increase in
  a new subtype of non-herpetic acute limbic encephalitis. In contrast, the
  incidence of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in Japan has dramatically decreased to
  a few patients per year; however, JE remains a threat for those with decreased
  or absent immunity to the JE virus. Imported emerging and reemerging CNS
  infections such as Murray Valley and West Nile encephalitis can occur in Japan.
  Influenza-associated encephalitis/encephalopathy is also described as a threat
  for adults as well as young children.

AB: Background: Planning and evaluating vaccination programs depend on reliable
  systems of monitoring disease incidence in the community. In Italy vaccine
  -preventable diseases are subject to statutory notification, but they are often
  unreported. In January, 2000, a pediatric sentinel network was launched, with
  the aim of monitoring in a timely and accurate way the geographic and temporal
  trends of vaccine-preventable diseases. Methods: The network consists of
  National Health System primary care pediatricians; participation is voluntary.
  The diseases under surveillance include measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis and
  varicella. Case definitions are based on specific clinical criteria, and
  pediatricians report cases on a monthly basis. Incidence rates are estimated
  and compared with those obtained by statutory notifications. The proportion of
  vaccinated cases is also computed. Results: In 2000 an average of 468
  pediatricians participated each month of a total of 7276 pediatricians under
  contract for primary care by the National Health System. The population under
  surveillance consisted of 371 670 children younger than 15 years (of a national
  total of 8 347 804 children of the same age). The annual national incidence per
  100 000 children was estimated at 5345 for varicella, 1972 for mumps, 279 for
  pertussis, 108 for rubella and 62 for measles, although wide variations were
  observed among geographic areas. The national estimates are 3 to 7 times higher
  than those obtained through statutory notifications. For all of the diseases
  the ratio between the two sources of data was significantly higher in southern
  Italy, compared with the rest of the country. The proportion of vaccinated
  cases was similar for measles and rubella (21 and 17%) but was approximately 3
  times higher for mumps (59%). Most (74%) of the vaccinated mumps cases had
  received the Rubini vaccine strain. Conclusions: The sentinel surveillance
  system is considerably more sensitive than statutory notifications,
  particularly in southern Italy. The high percentage of mumps cases vaccinated
  with the Rubini strain indicates a reduced effectiveness of this vaccine.
  Although further improvements are needed, pediatrician-based sentinel
  surveillance is a useful tool for evaluating vaccine-preventable disease trends.

AB: The fact that raccoons (Procyon lotor) are an opportunistic omnivore has
  severely complicated interpretations of contaminant uptake patterns due to the
  inability to determine the trophic position an individual occupies. Moreover,
  few studies have examined the relationships between heavy metal bioaccumulation
  and trophic structure, especially in the terrestrial environment. In this
  study, the stable isotopes of nitrogen were used to characterize the feeding
  habits of the raccoon at the population level and to determine whether metal
  burden was related to trophic feeding structure within a well-defined
  ecosystem. Raccoon populations were isotopically distinct, and significant
  positive relationships existed between some trace element contents and delta15N
  of muscle when site was used as a covariable in a statistical model. Although
  the transfer of metals through terrestrial ecosystems is complex, our study
  showed that some of the variation in contaminant body burdens in raccoon
  populations can be attributed to trophic feeding position and that 15N/14N
  ratios of muscle tissue provide a quantitative measure of this process. The
  potential for using omnivores such as the raccoon, as a sentinel species for
  contaminant studies, should be explored further since the ambiguity of the
  relative trophic level an animal occupies can be directly estimated. This
  provides a more extensive sampling across trophic levels using a single
  species, which can have broad consequences for ecological risk assessments.

AB: A total of 117 bird species has been recorded in Sehlabathebe National Park,
  south-east Lesotho, consisting of 29 vagrants, 18 visitors and 70 breeding and
  probable breeding residents. For each species status was determined and
  abundance roughly estimated. Quantitative studies on breeding bird communities
  were carried out by means of the line transect method on four transects with
  the total length ca 30 km in the park and on two transects with the total
  length of ca 20 km outside the park. In the park, dominant species were
  represented by the Stonechat Saxicola torquata, Ayres' Cisticola Cisticola
  ayresii, Yellow-rumped Widow Euplectes capensis and Wailing Cisticola Cisticola
  lais. Outside the park dominants were represented by Cape Weaver Ploceus
  capensis, Cape Sparrow Passer melanurus, Cape Canary Serinus canicollis, Common
  Quail Coturnix coturnix, Stonechat, Cape Butning Emberiza capensis and
  Drakensberg Siskin Pseudochloroptila symonsi. Characteristic, high-altitude
  species in the park included Drakensberg Siskin, Mountain Pipit Anthus hoeschi,
  Orange-breasted Rockjumper Chaetops auriantius, Banded Martin Riparia cincta
  and Sentinel Rock Thrush Monticola explorator. Species such as the Laughing
  Dove Streptopelia senegalensis, Sickle-winged Chat Cercomela sinuata, Mountain
  Chat Oenanthe monticola, Thick-billed Lark Galerida magnirostris, Red-winged
  Starling Onychognathus morio, Alpine Swift Apus melba, Cape Sparrow, Grey
  -headed Sparrow Passer diffusus, Red Bishop Euplectes orix and Golden Bishop
  Euplectes afer were absent or occurred in very low densities in the park,
  although they are widespread and common in the Maluti/Drakensberg grasslands
  (including areas neighbouring to the park). The lack of trees and shrubs for
  nesting, the lack of cultivated fields as feeding places and competition with
  related species both for food and nesting sites, may partly play a role in this
  regard.

AB: Objective: To provide community-level public health surveillance on alcohol
  misuse in South Africa and the associated negative consequences. Method: A
  descriptive, epidemiological study of alcohol use based on data gathered
  biannually from multiple sources over 4 years, including specialist treatment
  centers, trauma units, mortuaries, psychiatric facilities, and surveys of
  school students and arrestees. Networks were set up in five sentinel sites to
  facilitate the collection, interpretation and dissemination of data. Results:
  Indicators point to the widespread misuse of alcohol. Alcohol consistently
  dominates the demand for substance use disorders treatment services. In the
  second half of 2000, 51.1% (Cape Town) to 77.0% (Mpumalanga) of patients
  reported alcohol as their primary substance of abuse. A high proportion of
  patients in trauma units tested positive for alcohol in 2000, ranging from
  40.3% (Durban) to 91.8% (Port Elizabeth). Similarly, a high proportion of
  mortality cases tested positive for alcohol, ranging from 40.3% (Durban) to
  67.2% (Port Elizabeth). Although treatment demand is dominated by men and older
  persons, alcohol misuse occurs among all sectors. School surveys reflect
  harmful drinking patterns among students, with 53.3% and 36.5% of male students
  in Durban and Cape Town, respectively, reporting heavy-drinking episodes by
  Grade 11. Discussion: Alcohol misuse has a number of implications for public
  health policy, such as the need to develop protocols for the management of
  alcohol-positive patients in trauma units and to target prevention programs at
  heavy drinking by young people. Further monitoring of alcohol misuse and its
  associated negative consequences is required.

AB: The interaction between soil types, temperature, and soil water potential
  may have differential effects on the survival of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts
  in the terrestrial environment. We examined the effects of three soil types (a
  silty clay loam, silt loam, and loamy sand), three temperatures (4, 20, and
  30degreeC), and three soil water potentials (-0.033, -0.5 and -1.5 MPa) on the
  inactivation kinetics of oocysts. Sentinel chambers were filled with air-dried
  and sieved soil, brought to the appropriate soil water potential, and
  inoculated with 2X106 freshly purified oocysts. The inoculated chambers were
  buried in the same bulk soil at the appropriate water potentials and incubated
  at one of the three temperatures. Triplicate chambers were removed from the
  bulk soil on days 0, 22, 43, 84 and 156. Sentinel oocysts were extracted, and
  assayed for potential infectivity by the dye permeability method. Oocysts
  suspended in sterile distilled water and incubated with the sentinel chambers
  were used as controls for the effect of temperature. The soil water potentials
  investigated did not affect oocyst inactivation at any temperature or with any
  of the three soil types. Rates of oocyst inactivation increased significantly
  between 4 and 20degreeC, but not between 20 and 30degreeC with the exception of
  oocysts incubated in the silty clay loam. Oocyst survival appeared to be
  significantly greater in the silt loam soil than in the two other soil types
  when incubated at 20degreeC; and at 30degreeC oocyst survival was significantly
  less in the silt clay loam than in the other two soil types. Rates of sentinel
  oocyst inactivation at all three soil water potentials were significantly lower
  than the control oocysts in water at the three test temperatures. Thus oocyst
  survival in soil was not affected by the water potentials between -0.033 and 
  -1.5 MPa; it was affected by soil texture; but temperature appeared to be the
  factor most affecting oocyst survival. In the critical ambient range of
  temperature in temperate climates oocysts may survive for months in
  agricultural soil, and pose a threat to surface waters.

AB: Objective: To investigate the cause of sentinel lymph node biopsy failure
  and false negative result in vital blue injection for berast cancer. Methods:
  Eight-four female breast cancer patients were injected with vital blue to find
  the sentinel lymph nodes during operation. All patients were treated by the
  traditional radical or modified radical mastectomy with axillary dissection
  after sentinel node biopsy. All sentinel nodes, axillary lymph nodes and
  dissected specimens were submitted separately to pathological examination.
  Results: Sentinel node was not identified at the time of operation in 11
  patients, giving a failure rate of 13.1%. In 73 patients in whom sentinel nodes
  were identified, 32 (43.8%) revealed cancer invasion. Postoperative axillary
  node pathology showed cancer metastasis in all of them. Two patients who showed
  uninvaded sentinel nodes were demonstrated to have axillary node metastasis.
  These were the two false negative patients. Therefore, the prediction of
  axillary metastasis by the sentinel node biopsy showed a sensitivity of 90.4%,
  a specificity of 100% and a false negative rate of 2.7%. Conclusion: Failure in
  identifying the sentinel nodes in vital blue injection is related to the degree
  of mastering the technique and the method of injection. The cause of false
  negative result is due to an extensive primary tumor and the variation in the
  position of the sentinel lymph nodes.

AB: BACKGROUND: There are no data available from randomized controlled trials
  that compare the efficacy of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy with Level I/II
  axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in patients with breast carcinoma. We
  performed a formal decision analysis to determine whether SLN biopsy is
  appropriate, compared with ALND, for patients with T1, T2, and T3 tumors and to
  quantify the relative value of these two procedures in the management of
  patients with breast carcinoma. METHODS: All clinically relevant outcomes were
  modeled for both SLN biopsy and ALND. The probabilities of complications and
  outcomes were derived using data from the University of Louisville Breast
  Cancer Sentinel Lymph Node Study and from extensive review of previous studies.
  Utilities were assigned by the authors, incorporating values from the
  literature whenever possible. RESULTS: The expected utility of SLN biopsy was
  higher than the expected utility for ALND for T1 and T2 tumors that were 4.0 cm
  or smaller. There was no clear preference for either procedure with tumors that
  were larger than 4.0 cm. The T1 and T2 results were robust to sensitivity
  analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this decision analysis suggest that SLN
  biopsy is preferred over ALND for patients with breast tumors that are 4.0 cm
  or smaller. Patients should be aware of the potential for false-negative
  results in SLN biopsy, but this risk is outweighed by the decreased morbidity
  associated with the procedure itself.

AB: This paper briefly reviews the application of histopathology as aninstrument
  or endpoint in toxicity studies in fish. For long this has been applied rather
  occasionally in (regulatory) toxicology, and was mainly of interest in
  fundamental studies and limited carcinogenicity experiments. However, nowadays
  there are various incentives that ask for the application of pathology, such as
  field monitoring of pollution effects, the wish for optimal use and lower
  species of laboratory animals, the availability of modern histology techniques,
  and insight and interest in mechanistic data. This is timely illustrated by the
  current broad interest in endocrine disrupting pollutants-a threat mainly in
  the aquatic environment-where histopathological organ and tissue changes in
  intact sentinel fish species provide pivotal diagnostic and mechanistic
  features.

AB: Background: Diffuse iris melanoma is a rare variant of iris melanoma that
  has a flat growth pattern and often presents as unilateral hyperchromic
  heterochromia and glaucoma. There have been no large clinical reports of
  diffuse iris melanoma. Design: Single-center retrospective case series.
  Participants: Twenty-five consecutive patients with diffuse iris melanoma.
  Methods: A review of the clinical features, management, histopathologic
  analysis, and prognosis was performed. Main Outcome Measures: Clinical
  features, histopathologic features, management, and prognosis. Results: At the
  time of diagnosis, the mean patient age was 49 years. The initial complaint was
  unilateral darker eye color in 13 cases (52%) and blurred vision in 6 (24%).
  Six patients (24%) were symptom free. On presentation elsewhere, the initial
  diagnosis was iris melanoma or nevus in 11 cases (44%) and glaucoma in 14
  (56%), 8 (32%) of whom had prior laser or surgical treatment for glaucoma. The
  25 patients were observed for a mean of 30 months before the diagnosis of
  melanoma was suspected and referral to our center for evaluation. The mean
  intraocular pressure at referral was 36 mmHg, and the mean number of clock
  hours involved by tumor was 11. Heterochromia iridis was present in all 25
  cases (100%), corectopia in 23 (92%), and ectropion iridis in 21 (84%).
  Associated findings included unilateral cataract in 8 (32%), a prominent
  episcleral (sentinel) vessel in 7 (28%), and anterior chamber inflammation in 5
  (20%), and synechiae (anterior or posterior) in none. The tumor was managed by
  enucleation in 22 cases (88%) and by plaque brachytherapy in 3 (12%). Five
  cases (20%) were classified as spindle melanoma, 17 (68%) as mixed cell type,
  and 3 (12%) as epithelioid cell type. Therefore, histopathologic examination
  showed that 80% of cases contained epithelioid cells. All 22 enucleated cases
  were found to have tumor invasion in the trabecular meshwork. Tumor invasion of
  Schlemm's canal was found in 18 (82%), minor pars plicata in 12 (55%), and
  episclera in 7 cases (28%). Of seven cases with episcleral invasion, four
  underwent surgical treatment for glaucoma. Excluding one recent case, the
  patients were observed for a mean of 78 months. Liver metastasis developed in 3
  cases (13%). Conclusions: Diffuse iris melanoma is a serious ocular condition
  that causes unilateral hyperchromic heterochromia and secondary glaucoma, often
  leading to a delay in diagnosis. Local invasion of adjacent ocular structures
  is common, and distant metastasis occurs in 13% of cases at mean follow-up of
  78 months.

AB: We evaluated seropositivity to swine and human H1 influenza viruses in 74
  swine farm owners, employees, their family members, and veterinarians in rural
  south-central Wisconsin, compared with 114 urban Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
  residents. The number of swine farm participants with positive serum
  hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibody titers gtoreq40 to swine influenza
  viruses (17/74) was significantly higher (p<0.001) than the number of
  seropositive urban control samples (1/114). The geometric mean serum HI
  antibody titers to swine influenza viruses were also significantly higher
  (p<0.001) among the farm participants. Swine virus seropositivity was
  significantly (p<0.05) associated with being a farm owner or a farm family
  member, living on a farm, or entering the swine barn gtoreq4 days/week. Because
  pigs can play a role in generating genetically novel influenza viruses, swine
  farmers may represent an important sentinel population to evaluate the
  emergence of new pandemic influenza viruses.

AB: This paper presents the results of the follow-up of three sentinel herds
  between 1994 and 2000 during an East Coast fever (ECF) epidemic in eastern
  Zambia. The animals of the sentinel herds were closely monitored clinically and
  serologically together with detailed Rhipicephalus appendiculatus counts. Peaks
  of disease incidence occurred in the rainy season (December-February) and the
  dry months of May-July with nymph-to-adult tick transmission dominating the
  infection dynamics. A second wave of adult R. appendiculatus at the start of
  the dry season is essential for the occurrence of a full-blown epidemic while
  the size of the susceptible cattle population acts as a most important limiting
  factor. The majority of adult cattle of the sentinel herds became infected less
  than 2 years after the introduction of the disease. The median age at first
  contact for calves born towards the end of the study (1999) was about 6 months.
  The case-fatality ratio (including sub-clinical cases) is estimated at 60%. It
  is argued that part of the so-called 'natural mortality' is actually due to ECF
  and that ECF occurrence and mortality are systematically underestimated. The
  direct financial cost of the epidemic, based on loss of animals and cost of
  treatment only and calculated over 4 years running, is estimated at about
  USdollar sign 6 per year per animal at risk. The value of the traditional
  seroprevalence survey as a tool for monitoring ECF epidemiology is put in
  question and the prevalence of maternal antibodies in new-born calves,
  reflecting the immune status of the dam population, is introduced as an
  alternative. It is demonstrated that an efficient immunisation campaign should
  concentrate its efforts in the period of low adult R. appendiculatus abundance
  (July-October).

AB: Management of the axilla in early breast cancer is an issue of ongoing
  debate. We reviewed our experience in 312 patients who underwent axillary lymph
  node sampling between 1994 and 1998, of whom 81 patients (24%) had axillary
  lymph node metastasis. There have been two axillary recurrences, one associated
  with local recurrence to the breast and one presenting with distant metastasis.
  There were no patients with isolated axillary disease as their only site of
  recurrence and no axillary failures in the node-positive group treated with
  axillary sampling and radiotherapy. Axillary lymph node sampling effectively
  stages the axilla. This can safely be followed by radiotherapy to the axilla in
  case of lymph node metastasis. Axillary lymph node sampling forms a sound basis
  to develop new techniques, such as sentinel lymph node biopsy currently
  investigated by ongoing trials.

AB: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is an RNA virus
  in the order Nidovirales, family Arteriviridae, genus Arterivirus. The virus
  induces a prolonged viremia, replicates in macrophages, and produces persistent
  infection. The purpose of this study was to determine if PRRSV could persist
  for 90 d or more in a large population of breeding-age gilts housed under
  environmental conditions typical of commercial swine production and to
  determine if experimentally infected gilts could shed virus to naive sentinel
  gilts beyond 90 d postinfection. Using the intranasal route, we inoculated 120
  PRRSV-naive naive gilts, 4 mo of age, with 5 mL of cell culture fluid
  containing a total dose of 102.4 TCID50 of a field isolate (MN-30100) of PRRSV.
  The index gilts were organized into 3 groups (A, B, and C), 40 gilts per group.
  To assess the dynamics of the experimental infection, a monitor group of 30
  index gilts was blood-tested on days 0, 3, 7, 14, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180
  postinfection. PRRSV viremia was detected with the polymerase chain reaction
  (PCR) on days 3, 7, and 14 and by virus isolation (VI) on days 7 and 14. PRRSV
  antibodies were detected from day 14 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
  (ELISA). To assess shedding, 30 PRRSV-naive sentinel gilts were commingled with
  the index gilts on day 90 postinfection and tested by PCR, VI, and ELISA every
  15 d until 180 d postinfection; all samples were negative. To assess
  persistence, 40 index and 10 sentinel gilts were slaughtered at 120 (group A),
  150 (group B), or 180 (group C) d postinfection. Evidence of PRRSV was not
  detected by PCR or VI in any tissue samples from the 120 index gilts. These
  results indicate that persistence and shedding of PRRSV are of short duration
  in breeding-age gilts.

AB: Background: Sentinel lymphadenectomy reliably identifies the first site(s)
  of regional lymphatic drainage and, therefore, the most likely lymph nodes to
  contain occult metastasis in patients with primary cutaneous melanoma. Although
  in most patients lymphatic drainage from the primary melanoma first reaches a
  standard lymph node basin, a sentinel lymph node (SLN) may be identified in an
  unusual location. The objective of this study was to determine the frequency
  and significance of unusual sentinel lymph node drainage patterns in a large
  cohort of patients with primary melanoma. Methods: The records of 1145
  consecutive primary melanoma patients who underwent SLN biopsy were reviewed.
  Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy was performed in all patients with truncal
  melanoma and in many patients with distal extremity lesions. Unusual lymph node
  sites were defined as epitrochlear, popliteal, or ectopic/interval (in-transit
  or any other nonstandard lymph node-bearing area). Results: At least one SLN
  was harvested in 1117 patients (98%). SLN biopsy of an unusual lymph node site
  was attempted in 59 patients (5%). Successful intraoperative localization and
  biopsy was performed in 54 (92%) of 59 patients for a total of 56 unusual
  sites. Of these, 7 (13%) were popliteal, 8 (14%) were epitrochlear, and 41
  (73%) were ectopic/interval. Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy was performed in
  41 of these 54 patients and correctly identified unusual SLN locations in 12
  (29%); the majority of unusual SLNs were identified only with the assistance of
  the intraoperative gamma probe. In four patients (7%), the unusual lymph node
  site was the only site from which SLNs were harvested. In the remaining 50
  patients (93%), biopsies were performed on SLNs from both unusual sites and
  from a standard lymph node basin. Among the 54 patients who underwent a SLN
  biopsy of an unusual nodal site, 7 (13%) had lymph node metastases in that
  location. In four of the seven patients, the only positive SLN was from the
  unusual site. Conclusions: Sentinel lymphatic drainage patterns include lymph
  node-bearing areas that may be outside established standard lymph node basins
  and may represent the only site of regional lymph node metastases. Although
  preoperative lymphoscintigraphy may assist in the identification of unusual SLN
  drainage patterns, intraoperative use of the gamma probe is recommended to
  identify accurately and completely all sites of regional lymph node drainage.

AB: Purpose: To investigate the feasibility, toxicity, cosmetic outcome, and
  local control of high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy alone without whole breast
  external beam irradiation for early-stage breast carcinoma. Methods and
  Materials: Between June 1997 and August 1999, 32 women diagnosed with a total
  of 33 AJCC Stage I/II breast carcinomas underwent surgical breast excision and
  postoperative irradiation using HDR brachytherapy interstitial implantation as
  part of a multi-institutional clinical Phase I/II protocol. Eligible patients
  included those with T1, T2, N0, N1 (ltoreq3 nodes positive), and M0 tumors of
  nonlobular histologic features with negative surgical margins, no extracapsular
  lymph node extension, and a negative postexcision mammogram. Brachytherapy
  catheters were placed at the initial excision, reexcision, or either sentinel
  or full-axillary sampling. Direct visualization, surgical clips, and ultrasound
  and/or CT scan assisted in the delineation of the target volume, defined as the
  excision cavity plus a 2-cm margin. High-activity 192Ir (3-10 Ci) was used to
  deliver 340 cGy/fraction, 2 fractions/d, for 5 consecutive days, to a total
  dose of 34 Gy to the target volume. Source position and dwell times were
  calculated using standard volume optimization techniques. Results: The median
  follow-up of all patients was 33 months, and the mean patient age was 63 years.
  The mean tumor size was 1.3 cm, and 55% had an extensive intraductal component.
  Three patients had positive axillary nodes. Two patients experienced moderate
  perioperative pain that required narcotic analgesics. No peri- or postoperative
  infections occurred. No wound healing problems and no significant skin
  reactions related to the implant developed. The Radiation Therapy Oncology
  Group late radiation morbidity scoring scheme was applied to the entire 33-case
  cohort. In the assessment of the skin, 30 cases were Grade 0-1 and 3 cases were
  Grade 2. Subcutaneous toxicity was scored as 11 patients with Grade 0, 3 with
  Grade 1, 8 with Grade 2, 3 with Grade 3, and 8 with Grade 4. Clinically evident
  fat necrosis occurred in 8 patients at a median of 7.5 months after HDR
  brachytherapy completion. The only variables significantly associated with
  Grade 3-4 toxicity were the number of source dwell positions and the volume of
  tissue encompassed by the prescription isodose shell. The global cosmetic
  scores after a minimum of 18 months' follow-up were 0 cases with poor, 4 with
  fair, 5 with good, and 24 with excellent scores. One case of ipsilateral breast
  tumor recurrence was diagnosed 23 months after HDR brachytherapy, for a 4-year
  actuarial recurrence rate of 3%. This failure appeared to be a new primary
  tumor, because it was histologically distinct from the initial tumor and was
  located 9 cm from the initial tumor bed and 3 cm from the edge of the implant
  volume. Conclusion: Radiotherapy of the tumor bed alone with HDR interstitial
  brachytherapy is associated with a 33% incidence of Grade 3-4 s.c. toxicity,
  but with generally favorable overall cosmetic results. The risk of toxicity
  appears to be primarily related to the implant volume. With limited follow-up,
  the incidence of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence was low.

AB: The surgical management of non-palpable breast lesions remains
  controversial. At the European Institute of Oncology we have introduced a new
  technique, radio-guided occult lesion localization (ROLL) to replace standard
  methods and overcome their disadvantages. Regarding axillary dissection, probe
  -guided biopsy of the sentinel node (SN) is easy to apply, and the whole
  procedure is associated to a low risk of false negatives. We suggest that the
  SN technique should be widely adopted to stage the axilla in patients with
  breast cancer with clinically negative lymph nodes. Large-scale implementation
  of the sentinel node technique will reduce the cost of treatment as a result of
  shorter hospitalization times.

AB: The author selected the laboratory animals as indicators of coronavirus
  antigenic activity. It was estimated the coronavirus antigenic activity
  obtained with the use of different inactivators and adjuvants. It was
  established that more suitable sentinel animal among four species of laboratory
  animals (white mouse, white rat, cavy, rabbit) is white rat. The formaldehyde
  has the most marked inactivating action amongst three verified inactivators. It
  was shown the advantage of introduction antigen with adjuvant, but significant
  variation between adjuvants wasn't discriminated (aluminium hydroxide, silicon
  dioxide, mineral oil). It was established the increase of antigenic activity
  after 2-fold hypodermic injection of 1-2 ml vaccine with adjuvant and with
  interval of 2-3 weeks.

  distant metastases. However, few reports in the literature give detailed
  figures on different metastatic pathways in cutaneous melanoma. Objectives The
  aim of the present study was to perform a detailed analysis of the different
  metastatic pathways, the time course of the development of metastases and the
  factors influencing them. Methods In a series of 3001 patients with primary
  cutaneous melanoma at first presentation, 466 subsequently developed metastasis
  and were followed-up over the long term at the University of Tuebingen, Germany
  between 1976 and 1996. Different pathways of metastatic spread were traced.
  Associated risk factors for the different pathways were assessed. Differences
  in survival probabilities were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and
  evaluated by the log-rank test. Results In 50.2% of the patients the first
  metastasis after treatment of the primary tumour developed in the regional
  lymph nodes. In the remaining half of the patient sample the first metastasis
  developed in the lymphatic drainage area in front of the regional lymph nodes,
  as satellite or in-transit metastases (21.7%) or as direct distant metastases
  (28.1%). Anatomical location, sex and tumour thickness were significant risk
  factors for the development of metastasis by different pathways. The most
  important risk factor appeared to be the location of the primary tumour. The
  median intervals elapsing before the first metastasis differed significantly
  between the different metastatic pathways. The direct distant metastases became
  manifest after a median period of 25 months, thus later than the direct
  regional lymph node metastases (median latency period, 16 months) and the
  direct satellite and in-transit metastases (median latency period, 17 months).
  In patients who developed distant metastases the period of development was
  independent of the metastatic route. The time at which the distant metastases
  developed was roughly the same (between 24 and 30 months after the detection of
  the primary tumour), irrespective of whether satellite or in-transit
  metastases, lymph node metastases or distant metastases were the first to
  occur. Conclusions The time course of the development of distant metastasis was
  more or less the same irrespective of the metastatic pathway; this suggests
  that in patients with in-transit or satellite metastasis or regional lymph node
  metastasis, haematogenic metastatic spread had already taken place. Thus, the
  diagnostic value of sentinel lymph node biopsy and the therapeutic benefit of
  elective lymph node dissection may be limited, as satellite and in-transit
  metastases or direct distant metastases will not be detected and haematogenous
  spread may already have taken place when the intervention is performed.

AB: Skin homing T cells carry memory for cutaneous Ags and play an important
  sentinel and effector role in host defense against pathogens that enter via the
  skin. CCR10 is a chemokine receptor that is preferentially expressed among
  blood leukocytes by a subset of memory CD4 and CD8 T cells that coexpress the
  skin-homing receptor cutaneous lymphocyte Ag (CLA), but not the gut-homing
  receptor alpha4beta7. Homing and chemokine receptor coexpression studies
  detailed in this study suggest that the CLA+/CCR10+ memory CD4 T cell
  population contains members that have access to both secondary lymphoid organ
  and skin compartments; and therefore, can act as both "central" and "effector"
  memory T cells. Consistent with this effector phenotype, CLA+/CCR10+ memory CD4
  T cells from normal donors secrete TNF and IFN-gamma but minimal IL-4 and IL-10
  following in vitro stimulation. Interactions of CCR10 and its skin-associated
  ligand CC ligand 27 may play an important role in facilitating memory T cell
  entry into cutaneous sites during times of inflammation.

AB: Background. The sentinel lymph node concept is attractive in vulvar cancer
  because of the potential to avoid the morbidity associated with formal groin
  dissection. Case. An 84-year-old patient with a T2 carcinoma of the anterior
  vulva underwent surgery including bilateral sentinel node excision after
  identification with technetium-labeled nanocolloid. Frozen section histology
  showed a tumor deposit <1 mm in diameter in a left groin node whereas four
  nodes in the right groin were apparently negative. Completion lymphadenectomy
  was performed only for the left groin. Final histology including serial
  sectioning showed a micrometastasis in one of seven nodes from the right groin;
  no further treatment was given. Sixteen months postoperatively the patient
  developed a recurrence in the right groin; the left groin was free of tumor.
  Conclusion. This case indicates that groins with a micrometastasis detected by
  sentinel lymph node excision require further treatment.

AB: From 1995 to 2001, five rounds of sentinel surveillance were carried out for
  young women attending antenatal care clinics at four health centers in Addis
  Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia, to monitor trends in the prevalence of HIV
  infection and syphilis. Serum samples were tested for antibodies to HIV (enzyme
  -linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting) and antibodies to Treponema
  pallidum (T. pallidum hemagglutination assay and rapid plasma reagin test).
  Prevalence ratios for an increase in one calendar year were estimated using log
  -binomial models. Between 1995 and 2001, the prevalence of HIV infection among
  young women (age range, 15-24 years) attending antenatal care clinics in inner
  city health centers declined from 24.2% to 15.1% (prevalence ratio for an
  increase in one calendar year, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.87-0.95). No
  change was observed for older age groups or in outer city health centers. The
  decline in the prevalence of active syphilis (T. pallidum hemagglutination
  assay and rapid plasma reagin testing positive for antibodies to T. pallidum)
  was more pronounced among and also restricted to the young age groups (age
  range, 15-24 years) in the inner city (from 7.6% in 1995 to 1.3% in 2001;
  prevalence ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.59-0.80). The declining
  trends in the prevalence of HIV infection and syphilis among young women
  attending antenatal care clinics in the inner city are encouraging, but these
  findings require confirmation in future years and for other population groups.

AB: This study aimed to use a standard questionnaire to obtain a nationally
  representative sample of opinions on a range of potential food risks.
  Participants were a national sample of 1182 subjects selected using three
  different approaches: random and sentinel postal samples and a telephone
  survey. A modified psychometric questionnaire (the Perceived Food Risk Index)
  was administered to subjects on three occasions, spanning five time-points.
  Baseline data collection was undertaken from October to December 1998 (phase
  1). The second wave of data collection was undertaken over three time-points in
  February, April and July 1999 (one-third of respondents to phase 1 at each time
  -point - data combined as phase 2), and the final phase of data collection was
  between October and December 1999 (phase 3). Principal components analysis was
  used to assess the intercorrelations between the items on the questionnaire.
  Two main components were identified as 'dread' and 'knowledge'. Saturated fats
  were perceived as the least dreaded and the most known of the potential risks
  considered, while bovine spongiform encephalopathy and Salmonella were the
  risks dreaded the most. There was a slight perception that the potential risks
  had become more known over the year, especially for growth hormones. This study
  has raised a number of important issues for risk communicators. Despite current
  policy aimed at reducing fat intake, this will be difficult to achieve at a
  population level since people are not worried about its impact, yet food safety
  continues to be a significant concern to the public.

AB: Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that
  use 2 major pathways for antigen uptake: constitutive macropinocytosis and
  mannose receptor-mediated endocytosis. Efficient endocytosis is critical for
  DCs to fulfill their sentinel function in immunity. We investigated the
  influence of the immunosuppressive macrolide rapamycin on macropinocytosis of
  fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-albumin and mannose receptor-mediated
  endocytosis of FITC-dextran by murine bone marrow-derived DCs by flow
  cytometry. The data show that (1) at a low, physiologically relevant
  concentration (1 ng/mL), rapamycin impairs macropinocytosis and mannose
  receptor-mediated endocytosis; (2) the effects are independent of DC maturation
  and can be demonstrated specifically in immature CD11c+ major
  histocompatibility complex (MHC) class IIlo DCs by 3-color flow cytometry; (3)
  inhibition of endocytosis is not related to apoptotic cell death; and (4) molar
  excess of the structurally related molecule FK506 inhibits the actions of
  rapamycin. The inhibitory effects of rapamycin on DC endocytosis were confirmed
  in vivo. To our knowledge, this is the first report that a clinically relevant
  immunosuppressant inhibits DC endocytosis.

AB: Acute effects of the endocrine disruptor bis(tri-n-butyltin) oxide (TBTO) on
  molting-hormone biosynthesis and imaginaldisc development were investigated in
  larvae of the midge Chironomus riparius (Meigen). Ecdysteroid synthesis was
  measured by 24-h incubation of molting-hormone-synthesizing tissues
  (prothoracic glands) in vitro with or without the addition of TBTO. The amount
  of ecdysteroids produced was analyzed by radioimmunoassay. Developmental
  effects in vivo were investigated by determining the developmental phase of the
  genital imaginal discs before and after a 48-h exposure to TBTO in water. Sex
  -specific effects were found with both endpoints. Ecdysteroid synthesis was
  significantly reduced (analysis of variance (ANOVA), pltoreq0.005) in female
  larvae at all concentrations (TBTO-Sn at 50, 500, and 5,000 ng/L), whereas a
  significant elevation of the biosynthesis rate occurred in male larvae in the
  500-ng/L treatment (ANOVA, pltoreq0.05). In vivo experiments with development
  of the genital imaginal disc within a 48-h exposure period revealed a
  significantly slower development in female larvae and a significantly faster
  development in male larvae (contingency tables, pltoreq0.001) at all
  concentrations tested (TBTO-Sn at 10, 50, 200, and 1,000 ng/L). These results
  partly coincided with the in vitro effects on molting-hormone synthesis. The 48
  -h median lethal concentration (LC50) was 25 mug/L (20-30 mug/L 95% confidence
  intervals). The combination of in vitro and in vivo methods has proven to be a
  useful approach for the detection of endocrine effects of TBTO in C. riparius
  at levels 2,000-fold below the LC50 value. High sensitivity and short test
  duration suggest that chironomids may have potential as freshwater sentinel
  organisms for endocrine-disrupting chemicals.

AB: In the United States, identification of the sentinel lymph node (SLN)
  requires the use of 99mTc-labeled colloid, 1% isosulfan blue dye, or both to
  trace the lymphatic drainage of a given neoplasm. We report our experience with
  adverse reactions to isosulfan blue dye during SLN mapping in breast cancer. A
  chart review of the breast cancer SLN database was performed; it included 2392
  sequential patients who underwent SLN biopsy involving isosulfan blue dye at
  Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center from September 12, 1996, to August 17,
  2000. Thirty-nine of 2392 patients (1.6%) had a documented allergic reaction
  during the mapping procedure. Most reactions (69%) produced urticaria, blue
  hives, a generalized rash, or pruritus. The incidence of hypotensive reactions
  was 0.5%. Although anaphylaxis after the injection of isosulfan blue dye is
  rare, this article highlights the need to suspect anaphylaxis when hemodynamic
  instability occurs after the injection of this compound. Our experience
  indicates that bronchospasm and respiratory compromise are unusual and that
  most patients do not require emergent intubation and can be managed with short
  -term pressor support. In addition, our data indicate that patients with a
  sulfa allergy do not display a cross-sensitivity to isosulfan blue dye.

AB: Background: In several neoplastic diseases, immunosuppression has been shown
  to correlate with disease stage, progression, and outcome. As the prognosis for
  metastatic breast cancer is still pessimistic, additional strategies are being
  sought to improve survival. Local immunosuppression in sentinel node biopsies
  from 24 evaluable breast cancer patients was studied as a possible way of
  selecting patients for immunotherapy. Method: Sentinel node biopsy was
  performed in 24 out of 25 women operated on for primary breast cancer (one was
  not evaluable). Specimens were snap-frozen and double-stained for the zeta
  -chain of the T-cell receptor. The degree of down-regulation of the zeta-chain
  was evaluated in three different lymph-node areas: primary follicles, secondary
  follicles, and paracortex. Results: Down-regulation of varying degrees was
  noted in all 24 sentinel node biopsies. A high degree of down-regulation (more
  than 50% of T-cells not expressing zeta-chain) was seen in the primary
  follicles in six patients (25%), in the secondary follicles in 13 patients
  (72%), and in the paracortex in 19 patients (79%). Conclusion: Local down
  -regulation of an immune function parameter was seen in sentinel node biopsies
  from breast cancer patients. In addition to possible prognostic implications,
  the sentinel node might be an appropriate location for detecting early-stage
  immunological down-regulation, which might open a possibility of selecting
  patients who could benefit from immunotherapy.

AB: Dendritic cells (DC) support human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)
  transmission by capture of the virus particle in the mucosa and subsequent
  transport to the draining lymph node, where HIV-1 is presented to CD4+ Th
  cells. Virus transmission involves a high-affinity interaction between the DC
  -specific surface molecule DC-SIGN and the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120
  and subsequent internalization of the virus, which remains infectious. The
  mechanism of viral transmission from DC to T cells is currently unknown.
  Sentinel immature DC (iDC) develop into Th1-promoting effector DC1 or Th2
  -promoting DC2, depending on the activation signals. We studied the ability of
  these effector DC subsets to support HIV-1 transmission in vitro. Compared with
  iDC, virus transmission is greatly upregulated for the DC1 subset, whereas DC2
  cells are inactive. Increased transmission by DC1 correlates with increased
  expression of ICAM-1, and blocking studies confirm that ICAM-1 expression on DC
  is important for HIV transmission. The ICAM-1-LFA-1 interaction is known to be
  important for immunological cross talk between DC and T cells, and our results
  indicate that this cell-cell contact is exploited by HIV-1 for efficient
  transmission.

AB: Context: Welfare reform under the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work
  Opportunity Reconciliation Act replaced entitlement to cash assistance for low
  -income families with Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, thereby
  terminating or decreasing cash support for many participants. Proponents
  anticipated that continued receipt of food stamps would offset the effects of
  cash benefit losses, although access to food stamps was also restricted.
  Objective: To examine associations of loss or reduction of welfare with food
  security and health outcomes among children aged 36 months or younger at 6
  urban hospitals and clinics. Design and Setting: A multisite retrospective
  cohort study with cross-sectional surveys at urban medical centers in 5 states
  and Washington, DC, from August 1998 through December 2000. Participants: The
  caregivers of 2718 children aged 36 months or younger whose households received
  welfare or had lost welfare through sanctions were interviewed at hospital
  clinics and emergency departments. Main Outcome Measures: Household food
  security status, history of hospitalization, and, for a subsample interviewed
  in emergency departments, whether the child was admitted to the hospital the
  day of the visit. Results: After controlling for potential confounding factors,
  children in families whose welfare was terminated or reduced by sanctions had
  greater odds of being food insecure (adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 1.5; 95%
  confidence interval (CI), 1.1-1.9), of having been hospitalized since birth
  (AOR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.7) and, for the emergency department subsample, of
  being admitted the day of an emergency department visit (AOR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2
  -3.0) compared with those without decreased benefits. Children in families
  whose welfare benefits were decreased administratively because of changes in
  income or expenses had greater odds of being food insecure (AOR, 1.5; 95% CI,
  1.1-2.2) and of being admitted the day of an emergency department visit (AOR,
  2.8; 95% CI, 1.4-5.6). Receiving food stamps does not mitigate the effects of
  the loss or reduction of welfare benefits on food security or hospitalizations.
  Conclusion: Terminating or reducing welfare benefits by sanctions, or
  decreasing benefits because of changes in income or expenses, is associated
  with greater odds that young children will experience food insecurity and
  hospitalizations.

AB: In order to evaluate three bivalve species: Mytilus edulis, Perna viridis
  and Crassostrea gigas as a possible sentinel organism to monitor metal
  pollution in coastal waters, related literatures have been reviewed. The
  special attention was given to five requirements to use a sentinel organism:
  (1) ability to accumulate metals, (2) representative of coastal waters, (3)
  easily sampled year around, (4) easy to obtain a large amount and (5) wide
  distribution to cover all the continents. The metal concentrations (Mn, Cd, Cu,
  Ni, Pb and As) in transplanted Mytilus galloprovincialis (closely related
  species of M. edulis) and P. viridis into Tokyo Bay and Aburatsubo Bay were
  also monitored for 8 weeks to check accumulation patterns of the metals space.
  The literature review indicates that the combination of three species is
  necessary to meet the above requirements. Although all three species can
  accumulate metals efficiently (more than 106) and all are representative
  organisms of the intertidal zone, the geographical coverage of each species is
  limited. In order to cover world wide, the combination of the three is
  required. The transplanted bivalve studies indicate that these three species
  can be used interchangeably as a sentinel organism at least for Cd, Ni, Pb and
  As.

AB: Purpose: We determine the value of dynamic sentinel node biopsy for staging
  squamous cell carcinoma of the penis. Materials and Methods: A total of 90
  patients with clinically node negative penile cancer were prospectively entered
  in this study. Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy was performed after intradermal
  injection of 99mtechnetium nanocolloid around the primary tumor. The sentinel
  node was intraoperatively identified with the aid of intradermal administered
  patent blue dye and a gamma ray detection probe. Histopathological examination
  of sentinel nodes included serial sectioning and immunohistochemical staining.
  Regional lymph node dissection was performed only if metastasis was found in a
  sentinel node. Median followup was 36 months (range 5 to 95). Results:
  Lymphoscintigraphy visualized 217 sentinel nodes in 159 inguinal regions of 88
  patients. A total of 208 sentinel nodes were intraoperatively identified in 149
  inguinal regions of 88 patients. Sentinel node metastasis was found in 19
  inguinal regions of 18 patients. Four of 8 patients with unilateral clinical
  stage N1 disease had a tumor positive sentinel node on the opposite site.
  Regional recurrence after excision of a tumor negative sentinel node or after
  nonvisualization was seen in 5 patients, resulting in a false-negative rate of
  22% (5 of 23). The 3-year disease specific survival was 98% and 71% for
  patients with a tumor negative or tumor positive sentinel node, respectively (p
  = 0.0018). Conclusions: Occult lymph node metastases in penile cancer can be
  detected with a sensitivity of about 80% by dynamic sentinel node biopsy,
  including preoperative lymphoscintigraphy, vital dye and a gamma ray detection
  probe.

AB: Immune responses against tumor antigens will initially occur in the first
  tumor-draining lymph node, the sentinel node (SN). Because of extensive
  diagnostic procedures, obtaining a piece of SN to isolate viable immune cells
  for functional analyses is often impossible. For this reason an alternative
  method to obtain viable cells from a lymph node (LN) was investigated, ie,
  scraping LNs with a surgical blade, and compared with dissociation of total
  LNs. Tumor-draining lymph nodes were retrieved from five oncological patients.
  The collected dendritic cells and T cells were phenotypically and functionally
  characterized by flow cytometry and antigen-specific interferon (IFN)-gamma
  release in an ELISPOT assay. Results were compared between the two isolation
  methods. Viabilities and phenotypic characteristics of the collected cells were
  entirely comparable for both methods. T-cell functionality was also comparable
  between both methods, with equal T-cell expansion factors and similar
  frequencies of cytotoxic T cells specifically recognizing the M1 matrix protein
  of Influenza haemophilus or the tumor antigen Her-2/neu. In conclusion,
  scraping LNs to obtain cells for analysis of immune functions in LNs is
  feasible and presents a good alternative to dissociation of LNs. Scraping may
  even be applied to small LNs that a pathologist will submit entirely for
  histological examination and may thus prove useful in the monitoring of immune
  responses in SNs.

AB: Two species of bivalves, Mya arenaria and Mactromeris polynima, were exposed
  to contaminated marine sediments from Baie des Anglais, Quebec, for a period of
  10 and 12 weeks, respectively, in order to determine if there was an effect on
  the phagocytic activity of hemocytes from each species. These sediments contain
  elevated levels of both PAHs and PCBs. Uncontaminated beach sand was used as
  control sediments. After a period of 4 weeks, each species of bivalves were
  sampled and hemocyte phagocytic activity was monitored by flow cytometry. While
  phagocytosis by hemocytes from M. polytiyma was significantly suppressed, those
  from M. arenaria were not different from beach sand-exposed controls. At the
  end of the exposure period, the phagocytic activity of hemocytes from both
  species was suppressed. Physiological parameters such as mantle proteins or
  malondialdehyde levels, total protein and total glycogen levels in the
  digestive gland were not affected by exposure to contaminated sediments.
  Moreover, the suppression of phagocytosis was well correlated with the transfer
  of contaminants from the sediments to the bivalves and their subsequent
  bioaccumulation, as demonstrated by the PCB body burden. These results support
  the use of bivalves as good sentinel species to survey sediment contamination
  and the usefulness of hemocyte phagocytic activity as a sensitive biomarker of
  exposure to organic contaminants.

AB: Iodine-129 is routinely released in the gaseous and liquid low-level
  radioactive effluents of nuclear spent fuel reprocessing plants. Environmental
  impact assessment of these discharges are performed based on monitoring samples
  of different types of natural indicators. Thyroid is considered as a relevant
  organ to monitor radioactive iodine isotopes. In this study, bovine thyroids
  were collected in herds located in the Cotentin area under the influence of
  authorized low level gaseous effluents of the La Hague nuclear fuel
  -reprocessing plant. For low level 129I/127I ratios, characteristic of
  environmental samples (10-12 to 10-7), RNAA or SMA that includes important
  radiochemical preparation steps are used. This paper demonstrates the interest
  of direct gamma-X spectrometry to measure 129I activities, associated to INAA
  to measure 127I to attain higher ratios levels (10-6 to 10-4). This study shows
  the interest of monitoring bovine thyroids considered as sentinel organs to
  characterize the dispersion in space and time of 129I discharged in low level
  radioactive gaseous effluents by the La Hague reprocessing plant.

AB: 1. In order to realize the full potential of natural enemies in integrated
  pest management, it is necessary to understand their population dynamics,
  particularly in relation to the role of refuges. Harvested and unharvested
  plots were established in a commercial hay lucerne Medicago sativa crop and the
  potential for the unharvested vegetation to constitute a refuge for natural
  enemies of Helicoverpa spp., one of the key pests, was evaluated. 2. The
  temporal and spatial dynamics of arthropod populations were evaluated using
  sequential samples from directional traps (pitfall and Malaise) and vacuum
  sampling in both crop treatments. 3. The spatial dynamics of predation were
  measured using 'sentinel' cards baited with Helicoverpa spp. eggs. 4. There was
  no significant directional movement of arthropods captured in pitfall traps,
  except for a 3-day period immediately after harvest when there was a net
  movement of the natural enemies Dicranolaius bellulus, Carabidae adults,
  spiders and the phytophagous mite Halotydeus destructor from harvested to
  unharvested plots. 5. There was net movement of adult Netelia producta, D.
  bellulus, Coccinella transversalis and Syrphidae as well as the pest
  Helicoverpa spp. from harvested to unharvested plots for 24 h following a
  harvest. 6. Densities of D. bellulus and C. transversalis within unharvested
  plots decreased with increasing distance from the borders with harvested plots.
  7. Predation rates of Helicoverpa eggs placed in unharvested plots were broadly
  consistent with predator densities and decreased with distance from the
  harvested plots. 8. Predation rates of Helicoverpa eggs placed in harvested
  plots declined with increasing distance from unharvested plots, suggesting that
  natural enemies from the latter dispersed into regrowing lucerne. 9. Strips
  narrower than the plot width used (30 m) may be adequate to accommodate natural
  enemies displaced by harvesting. Unharvested refuge strips should ideally be
  spaced less than 30 m apart so that the natural enemies can contribute to
  biological control of pests over the entire width of harvested strips.

AB: In order to determine the frequency of therapeutic failures to chloroquine
  (CQ) in patients with malaria due to either Plasmodium falciparum or P. vivax,
  and to explore the usefulness of a malaria-free city as a sentinel site to
  monitor the emergence of drug resistance, 53 patients (44 infected with P.
  vivax and 9 with P. falciparum) were evaluated at the Laboratory of
  Parasitology, Universidad del Valle in Cali, Colombia. Patients received 25
  mg/kg of CQ divided in three doses over 48 h; they were followed during 28 days
  according to WHO/PAHO protocols. While therapeutic failures to CQ in the P.
  vivax group were not detected, the proportion of therapeutic failures in the P.
  falciparum group was high (78%) and consistent with the reports from endemic
  areas in Colombia. The diverse origin of cases presenting therapeutic failure
  confirmed that P. falciparum resistant to CQ is widespread in Colombia, and
  further supports the change in the national antimalarial drug scheme.
  Monitoring of drug resistance in malaria free areas would be useful to identify
  sites requiring efficacy evaluation, and in some situations could be the most
  appropriate alternative to collect information from endemic areas where
  therapeutic efficacy studies are not feasible.

AB: This study was undertaken to assess whether the immunoperoxidase technique
  using anti-BCG serum is able to confirm the diagnosis of early leprosy among
  patients whose unique clinical manifestation is a localized area of sensory
  loss, in a higher proportion than the routine mycobacterial staining methods,
  namely hematoxylin-eosin and Wade. The study was held in the north of a hyper
  -endemic area of leprosy, Manaus, Amazonas (Brazil). Fifty-one paraffin
  -embedded skin biopsy blocks were retrieved and processed for the
  immunohistochemical study, by means of anti-BCG polyclonal antibodies for the
  detection of mycobacterial antigens. The routine stains confirmed the leprosy
  diagnosis in 17% of the cases, while the immunostaining method confirmed it in
  47%. The McNemar test showed that the observed difference between these two
  techniques was statistically significant (p=<0.05). In the same way, 50 blocks
  of skin conditions considered in the differential histopathological diagnosis
  of early leprosy were processed for the immunohistochemical test to analyze the
  possibility of false-positive results which occurred in 8 (16%) patients. The
  study suggests that immunostaining may increase the proportion of the routine
  histological diagnosis of leprosy in patients who have sensory loss only, even
  while using biopsies obtained in fieldwork conditions. This is very
  advantageous in hyper-endemic areas and in areas that are in the post
  -elimination period of leprosy control where sensory loss may be a sentinel
  sign of the disease.

AB: Background: Radiotracer and blue-dye lymphatic mapping is a recommended
  combined method to guide sentinel lymphadenectomy and full regional lymph node
  dissection in selected patients with cutaneous melanoma. Objective: To evaluate
  the diagnostic accuracy and the prognostic value of gamma-probe-directed
  lymphatic mapping in cutaneous melanomas. Methods: Sixty-five stage I and II
  melanoma patients underwent gamma-probe-directed lymphatic mapping. Sentinel
  lymph nodes were studied by both conventional and immunohistochemical
  stainings. The median follow-up was 11 months. Results: Sensitivities of
  preoperative and intraoperative sentinel lymph node detection were 100 and 98%,
  respectively. Only 1 failure of detection and 1 missed same-basin metastasis
  were experienced in the axillary and cervical areas, respectively. Eleven
  patients (16.9%) had sentinel node metastases leading to adjuvant therapy.
  Conclusion: Gamma-probe-directed lymphatic mapping is useful for staging
  melanoma. However, in the expectation of a more specific identification of the
  sentinel lymph node, the standard protocol remains recommended for exploring
  the axillary and cervical areas. The histological examination supported in some
  cases by immunohistochemistry remains mandatory in all cases.

AB: BACKGROUND: As sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) becomes a new surgical
  standard in the treatment of patients with breast carcinoma, there is an
  emergent need for a fast and accurate method with which to assess the SN
  intraoperatively, so a decision can be made regarding whether to perform
  axillary lymph node dissection during primary surgery. In the current study,
  the authors performed a prospective investigation of the relative merits of
  imprint cytology for that purpose. METHODS: Seventy-six patients with T1-T2
  breast carcinoma were included after undergoing successful SNB. SNs were
  freshly sectioned at 2-mm intervals and imprint smears were obtained from all
  cut surfaces. The smears were examined using a rapid May-Grunwald-Giemsa stain
  variation, and the SNs were judged to be positive or negative for metastases.
  SNs later were submitted for paraffin embedding and serial sectioning. Both
  hematoxylin and eosin stained and cytokeratin (CK) immunostained sections were
  examined. The postoperative evaluation of the SNs was taken as the gold
  standard. RESULTS: Intraoperative cytology showed a sensitivity of 67.7%, a
  specificity of 100%, an accuracy of 86.8%, and a negative predictive value of
  81.8%. The majority of false-negative cases (8 of 10 cases) were due to
  micrometastasis in the SNs that were discovered only after exhaustive
  examination with serial sectioning and CK immunostaining. CONCLUSIONS: The
  results of the current study demonstrate that the accuracy of imprint cytology
  is high enough to warrant its use for intraoperative SN assessment. If the
  findings are negative, axillary lymph node dissection can be omitted. Only a
  few patients with SN micrometastasis may require reoperation.

AB: The purpose of this paper is to review the methods used to measure quality
  of stroke care. Relevant articles were searched for on Medline using the
  following key words: stroke, quality, outcome of care, process of care,
  structure of care. Articles that examined how to measure the quality of stroke
  care and that examined difficulties in the measurement of care outcomes,
  processes, and structures were selected. Selected articles were reviewed to
  summarise methods used to measure quality of stroke care and the primary
  outcome measures of the studies were extracted. Conclusions were drawn about
  the best ways to measure the quality of stroke care. Practical problems in
  using outcome measures to monitor quality of care include the consequences of
  case mix and difficulties in risk adjustment. Clinicians may use process
  measures to understand differences in outcome. Once a process of care has been
  linked to an outcome measure, this care process should be measured. The
  national sentinel audit for stroke is an audit tool used to examine the quality
  of the processes of stroke care.

AB: The high mortality rates associated with cancer can be attributed to the
  metastatic spread of tumor cells from the site of their origin. Tumor cells
  invade either the blood or lymphatic vessels to access the general circulation
  and then establish themselves in other tissues. Clinicopathological data
  suggest that the lymphatics are an initial route for the spread of solid
  tumors. Detection of sentinel lymph nodes by biopsy provides significant
  information for staging and designing therapeutic regimens. The role of
  angiogenesis in facilitating the growth of solid tumors has been well
  established, but the presence of lymphatic vessels and the relevance of
  lymphangiogenesis to tumor spread are less clear. Recently, the molecular
  pathway that signals for lymphangiogenesis and relatively specific markers for
  lymphatic endothelium have been described allowing analyses of tumor
  lymphangiogenesis to be performed in animal models. These studies demonstrate
  that tumor lymphangiogenesis is a major component of the metastatic process and
  implicate members of the VEGF family of growth factors as key mediators of
  lymphangiogenesis in both normal biology and tumors.

AB: A radioactively labeled blue liposome formulation was developed for use in
  presurgical lymphoscintigraphy and intraoperative sentinel node localization to
  avoid the differing injection site clearance kinetics of the conjunctive use of
  separate formulations of low molecular weight blue dye and radioactively
  labeled macromolecular sulfur colloid. Blue liposomes containing glutathione in
  the internal aqueous phase were prepared form blue dyed lipids obtained by
  covalently binding Reactive Blue II to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) fractions
  of phospholipid extracts. Four phospholipid extracts with differing PE
  fractions and a centrifugation technique were evaluated with the goal of
  maximizing the blue color intensity of the formulation. Stability of the
  formulations was evaluated by studying radiolabeling efficiency (using a
  membrane permeable lipophilic carrier of the commonly used diagnostic
  radionuclide, technetium-99m) and particle-size distribution over 30-60 day
  periods. Blue color was not altered by varying the PE content, while
  centrifugation was an effective and convenient method to maximize the blue
  color intensity of the final preparation. The particle size distribution of the
  prepared liposomes ranged from 200-300 nm (considered ideal for
  lymphoscintigraphy studies) and did not change significantly, while
  radiolabeling efficiency exceeded 80% for up to 1 month. The described kit
  formulation for the preparation of radiolabeled blue liposome is suitable for
  commercial production allowing widespread clinical use. The combination of a
  means of visual identification and tracking of the liposomes through the
  lymphatic channels along with the ability to trace the preparation using
  standard radiation detection instrumentation provides the surgeon with an
  improved radiolabeled compound for lymphoscintigraphy and intraoperative
  sentinel lymph node identification.

AB: There is no consensus method for the histological analysis of axillary
  sentinel nodes (SN). This study aimed to (1) assess the rate of occult
  metastases in SN using large serial sectioning and immunohistochemistry (IHC),
  (2) evaluate whether occult metastases were predictive of metastases in the
  downstream axillary nodes, and (3) specify a methodology of analysis of SN that
  could be both sensitive and applicable in daily practice. One hundred three
  patients with breast carcinoma underwent SN biopsy and then axillary
  dissection. SN free of tumor at standard examination of one section were
  sectioned at six levels (150-mum intervals) and immunostained for cytokeratin.
  The number and localization of labeled metastatic cells (occult metastases)
  were recorded. In 29 of the 103 patients (28%), SN were found to be metastatic
  after standard examination. The SN of the remaining 74 patients were further
  analyzed using IHC. Occult metastases were detected in 35 of these patients
  (47.3%), leading to an overall SN involvement rate of 62% (29+35/103). In 33 of
  these 35 cases, the plurality and the dispersion of the immunostained cells
  implied that the screening of only 3 of the 6 levels would have led to the
  detection of diagnostic positive events. Only one of the 35 patients (2.8%)
  with occult metastases showed metastatic lymph node in the downstream axilla.
  In our series of axillary SN, the analysis of one standard histologic section
  and, when negative, of only three additional sections after IHC revealed >60%
  of metastasis or occult metastasis. Metastasis detected by standard analysis
  had a high predictive value of downstream node metastasis, whereas the
  predictive value of occult metastasis revealed by IHC was poor. The clinical
  significance of occult metastases in SN needs to be specified by long-term
  follow-up analysis.

AB: Background: The objective of this descriptive study is to investigate the
  incidence of type 2 diabetes in sentinel general practices in three regions in
  Belgium and to describe the patient characteristics and the start of the
  medical management after diagnosis. Methods: For two successive years all
  patients who were newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes were registered. Two
  weeks after inclusion, the registering physician completed an extensive
  questionnaire. This questionnaire dealt with risk factors, biochemical
  parameters, existing complications and treatment. Results: According to this
  study, the yearly incidence of type 2 diabetes in Belgium is 231 per 100, 000
  inhabitants. Though the biochemical parameters (BMI, HbA1c, serum cholesterol
  and triglycerides) do not differ in the three regions of the country being
  investigated, there are considerable differences in the treatment prescribed
  for diabetes and its co-morbidity. In Flanders, treatment is usually started
  with sulphonylurea, in the Walloon provinces with biguanides. Hypolipaemic
  treatment is also started more frequently in the latter region. In Flanders,
  hypertension is registered in 51.4% of the newly diagnosed patients with
  diabetes, which is higher than in the other regions. However, no difference is
  noted between the different regions in the number of patients with diabetes who
  are treated for hypertension. Conclusion: A network of sentinel physicians,
  taking part in voluntary registration, can be helpful in calculating the
  incidence of a health problem, in particular type 2 diabetes in general
  practice. The sentinel net can also serve as an instrument for describing
  patient characteristics and showing how physicians deal with health problems.
  The regional differences in medical approach that are described require further
  investigation, mainly with respect to their impact on the patients' outcome.

AB: The procedure of sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with malignant
  cutaneous melanoma has evolved from the notion that the tumor drains in a
  logical way through the lymphatic system, from the first to subsequent levels.
  As a consequence, the first lymph node encountered (the sentinel node) will
  most likely be the first affected by metastasis; therefore, a negative sentinel
  node makes it highly unlikely that other nodes in the same lymphatic basin are
  affected. Although the long-term therapeutic benefit of the sentinel lymph node
  biopsy per se has not yet been ascertained, this procedure distinguishes
  patients without nodal metastases, who can avoid nodal basin dissection with
  its associated risk of lymphedema, from those with metastatic involvement, who
  may benefit from additional therapy. Sentinel lymph node biopsy would represent
  a significant advantage as a minimally invasive procedure, considering that an
  average of only 20% of melanoma patients with a Breslow thickness between 1.5
  and 4 mm harbor metastasis in their sentinel node and are therefore candidates
  for elective lymph node dissection. Furthermore, histologic sampling errors
  (amounting to approximately 12% of lymph nodes in the conventional routine) can
  be reduced if one assesses a single (sentinel) node extensively rather than
  assessing the standard few histologic sections in a high number of lymph nodes
  per patient. The cells from which cutaneous melanomas originate are located
  between the dermis and the epidermis, a zone that drains to the inner lymphatic
  network in the reticular dermis and, in turn, to larger collecting lymphatics
  in the subcutis. Therefore, the optimal route for interstitial administration
  of radiocolloids for lymphoscintigraphy and subsequent radioguided sentinel
  lymph node biopsy is intradermal or subdermal injection. 99mTc-Labeled colloids
  in various size ranges are equally adequate for radioguided sentinel lymph node
  biopsy in patients with cutaneous melanoma, depending on local experience and
  availability. For melanomas along the midline of the head, neck, and trunk,
  particular consideration should be given to ambiguous lymphatic drainage, which
  frequently requires interstitial administration virtually all around the tumor
  or surgical scar from prior excision of the melanoma. Lymphoscintigraphy is an
  essential part of radioguided sentinel lymph node biopsy because images are
  used to direct the surgeon to the sites of the nodes. The sentinel lymph node
  should have a significantly higher count than that of the background (at least
  10:1 intraoperatively). After removal of the sentinel node, the surgical bed
  must be reexamined to ensure that all radioactive sites are identified and
  removed for analysis. Virtually the entire sentinel lymph node should be
  processed for histopathology, including both conventional hematoxylin-eosin
  staining and immune staining with antibodies to the S-100 and HMB-45 antigens.
  The success rate of radioguidance in localizing the sentinel lymph node in
  melanoma patients is approximately 98% in institutions that perform a high
  number of procedures and approaches 99% when combined with the vital blue-dye
  technique. Growing evidence of the high correlation between a sentinel lymph
  node biopsy negative for cancer and a negative status for the lymphatic basin
  -evidence, therefore, of the high prognostic value of sentinel node biopsy-has
  led to the procedure's being included in the most recent version of the TNM
  staging system and starting to become the standard of care for patients with
  cutaneous melanoma.

AB: Levels of tributyltin (TBT) and its degradation products, mono- (MBT) and
  dibutyltin (DBT), as well as triphenyltin (TPT), were monitored in 10 stations
  along the Polish coast (Baltic Sea). Mussel-Mytilus edulis-and fish-Platichthys
  flesus-were used as sentinel organisms. The bioaccumulation patterns of
  butyltin and phenyltin compounds varied substantially. Butyltins were detected
  in mussel tissue from all the sampled stations. Among them, organisms from the
  Gulf of Gdansk showed the highest residues (68 ng/g w.w. as Sn) in conjunction
  with elevated TBT/DBT ratios, which suggest recent inputs of TBT in the area.
  Additionally, flatfish were sampled in the Gulf of Gdansk, and different
  tissues (liver, digestive tube and gills) were analyzed separately. TPT,
  although undetected in mussels, was always present in fish. The highest
  organotin concentration was observed in the liver (369 ng/g w.w. as Sn) of fish
  caught near Gdansk port. Relatively high concentrations were observed in
  digestive tube, which points out the ingestion of organotin contaminated food
  as an important uptake route of those compounds in P. flesus.

AB: Although considerable information has accumulated in the last decade
  regarding rates of both vaginal colonization and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC)
  in HIV-positive women, gaps in our knowledge remain, particularly with regard
  to pathophysiology of clinical disease. Unfortunately, early and possibly
  premature conclusions were reached in the late 1980s which resulted in the
  widespread dissemination of information indicating that recurrent VVC (RVVC)
  was a manifestation of HIV infection and that women with RVVC should be tested
  for HIV. Unfortunately, subsequent data from cohort studies involving HIV
  -positive women failed to determine attack rates of symptomatic Candida
  vaginitis requiring therapy. Recent studies indicate that Candida vaginitis,
  even if more frequent in HIV infected women, is clinically similar to that
  experienced in HIV-negative women and does not appear to be of increased
  clinical severity. VVC in HIV-positive women can be treated by conventional
  methods including the use of maintenance suppressive antifungal therapy and
  most importantly RVVC in women is not in itself a sentinel of HIV infection.
  Ongoing concerns include vaginal acquisition of non-albicans Candida species
  and the development of antimycotic drug resistance in C. albicans vaginal
  isolates.

AB: Aims and background: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is currently used and
  investigated in melanoma and in breast cancer. Its utility in gastrointestinal
  malignancies is still under debate. The prognosis of colorectal cancer patients
  is strongly related to the lymphatic involvement. The aim of this study was to
  evaluate the feasibility of SLN mapping in colorectal cancer and to assess its
  impact on pathological staging and treatment. Methods and study design: We
  injected blue dye in 11 colorectal cancer patients during surgery. After
  resection the tumor specimen was examined to identify blue-stained lymph nodes
  and these lymph nodes were sent separately to the pathologist. Routine
  hematoxylin-eosin examination was performed on all nodes (including blue ones).
  No other techniques (eg immunohistochemistry or PCR) were performed. Results:
  Sentinel lymph nodes were successfully identified in 10 of the 11 patients. We
  observed only one false negative result (10%) and the agreement between SLN and
  other lymph node status was 80% (8/10). One patient was upstaged: SLN was
  positive for metastases while the other lymph nodes were negative. Conclusions:
  Lymphatic mapping using patent blue dye is feasible in colorectal cancer. The
  identification of lymph nodal metastases by this technique led to upstaging of
  one patient, who may benefit from adjuvant therapy. These initial results
  prompt further investigation of this procedure as an accurate, minimally
  invasive staging approach in early colorectal cancer. We proceed with our study
  to evaluate the role of SLN mapping in colorectal cancer management.

AB: Introduction: The usefulness of routine axillary dissection (AD) at levels I
  -II in breast cancer patients has been questioned for years because of the high
  postoperative morbidity in the shoulder and arm region, and the increasing
  number of patients with negative nodes. Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) was hoped
  both to reduce morbidity and to improve the reliability of staging. This study
  was designed to provide more evidence in this matter by comparing the follow-up
  data of patients with AD and those with SNB only. Method: One hundred forty
  patients who had undergone AD between 1993 and 1996 were questioned for their
  subjective and objective symptoms using a questionnaire and subsequently
  subjected to a clinical examination. Their data were compared with those of 57
  patients who had undergone SNB only between 1998 and 2000. Results: Local
  recurrences have not been seen to date. The difference between the two groups
  in terms of a loss of quality of life was negligible. The differences in
  overall complaints, number of symptoms, pain, limited range of motion of the
  operated upper extremity, numbness, paresthesias, and arm swelling as well as
  perceived disability in activities of daily living were significantly in favor
  of SNB. The length of hospital stay was significantly shorter for SNB patients.
  Conclusion: SNB appears to be an accurate procedure for axillary nodal staging
  in breast cancer patients and is associated with reduced postoperative
  morbidity and length of hospital stay. But it is still investigational and
  should not be implemented as therapeutical standard before results of
  randomized trials are published.

AB: Background: S100 protein is an acidic calcium binding protein that is
  expressed by melanoma cells. Elevated serum values of S100 have been described
  in metastatic disease and it has been suggested that it may be used as an
  adjunct to staging and monitoring of treatment. Micrometastatic disease in the
  sentinel lymph node can be demonstrated by sentinel node biopsy (SNB) and the
  sentinel node status is known to be the most important predictor of relapse.
  Objectives: To determine whether serum S100 concentrations could predict the
  presence of micrometastatic disease. Methods: Thirty-one patients with primary
  cutaneous melanoma >1 mm were recruited from referrals to the Melanoma clinic.
  All patients had serum S100 concentrations evaluated prior to undergoing SNB.
  Serum S100 concentrations were established using an immunoluminometric method.
  Sentinel nodes were identified using a dual technique with both radiolabelled
  colloid (residual from preoperative lymphoscintigraphy) and blue dye according
  to the MD Anderson Cancer Center protocol. Results: Nine of these 31 patients
  had evidence of micrometastatic disease on SNB. The mean serum S100
  concentration of those with positive SNBs was 0.027 mug L-1 compared with 0.045
  mug L-1 in patients with negative SNBs (normal <0.14 mug L-1). No patient in
  the study demonstrated raised concentrations of serum S100. Conclusions: We
  conclude that serum S100 concentrations do not predict the presence of
  micrometastatic melanoma in sentinel nodes in primary cutaneous melanoma.

AB: Approximately one-third of node-negative colon cancers will recur, possibly
  due to understaging and inadequate pathological examination of lymph nodes
  (LNs). We evaluated the sensitivity, accuracy and feasibility of staging based
  on lymphatic mapping, focused examination, and molecular analysis of the
  sentinel node (SN) in patients with primary colorectal carcinoma. Between 1996
  and 2000, 100 patients with colon carcinoma (CRC) underwent lymphatic mapping
  immediately after peritumoral injection of 1.0 cc of isosulphan blue dye. All
  LNs in the CRC specimen were examined by routine haematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
  staining. Sentinel nodes were examined by step serial sectioning, cytokeratin
  immunohistochemistry (CK-IHC) and/or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
  reaction (RT-PCR) analysis in an attempt to identify occult micrometastatic
  disease. Lymphatic mapping was successful in 97% of the cases. There were 5
  false-negative cases, predominately associated with T3/T4 tumours. Aberrant
  lymphatic drainage was identified in 8 patients (8%) altering the operative
  approach. 26 patients had H&E-positive LNs. In 74 patients who were node
  -negative by routine H&E, 18 (24%) had occult nodal micrometastases missed on
  routine H&E examination, but detected by focused analysis of the SN. RT-PCR
  analysis of the SN was performed in 40 patients, 26 of which were negative by
  H&E and CK-IHC. In 12/26 (46%) of these patients, there was additional evidence
  of micrometastatic disease. In this study, focused examination of the SN in
  conjunction with RT-PCR analysis identified micrometastatic disease in a
  significant number of node-negative patients. This may have important
  implications when selecting patients for adjuvant treatment protocols.

  staging in patients with malignant melanoma. Intraoperative evaluation is a new
  addition to the SLN procedure that allows for a one-step regional lymph node
  dissection to be performed when the SLN biopsy findings are positive. To date,
  several studies have evaluated the use of intraoperative frozen sectioning to
  evaluate the SLN in patients with melanoma. The literature pertaining to the
  use of intraoperative imprint cytology (IIC) to evaluate the SLN in melanoma
  patients is scant and to the authors' knowledge studies published to date are
  relatively small. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the utility
  of IIC in patients undergoing SLN for melanoma. METHODS. A total of 235 SLN
  biopsies from 93 patients with malignant melanoma and 3 patients with atypical
  Spitz nevi were examined by IIC after SLN biopsy using a double indicator
  technique. The SLNs were bisected and a pair of imprints were made from each
  half. One imprint from each half was stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E)
  whereas its counterpart was stained with Diff-Quik. Paraffin-embedded permanent
  sections were examined using multiple H & E stained sections from the SLNs in
  conjunction with immunohistochemical staining for S-100 and HMB-45 proteins.
  RESULTS. A total of 235 SLNs were excised from 93 patients (2.5 SLNs per
  patient). On a per patient basis, metastases were identified in 21 patients
  (23%) on permanent section evaluation. Of these 21 patients, 8 were detected by
  IIC (sensitivity of 38%). The negative predictive value was 85%. No false
  -positive results were identified (specificity of 100%). The positive
  predictive value was 100%. The overall accuracy of the intraoperative
  evaluation was 86%. Patients found to have positive SLNs by IIC went on to
  undergo lymphadenectomy under the same anesthetic. CONCLUSIONS. The sensitivity
  and specificity of IIC are similar to those of intra-operative frozen-section
  evaluation. Therefore, IIC appears to be a viable alternative to frozen
  sectioning when intraoperative evaluation is required. IIC evaluation of SLN
  makes a single surgical procedure possible for patients with malignant melanoma
  who are undergoing SLN.

AB: Debate over the infection hazards of pig-to-human xenotransplantation has
  focused mainly on the porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERV). However, hazards
  of exogenous infectious agents possibly associated with the xenograft have also
  been evaluated (Xenotransplantation 2000; 7: 143). We report the results of a
  health monitoring program demonstrating the exclusion of more than 80 potential
  pathogens from nine cohorts of pigs reared in a high welfare bioexclusion
  facility as potential xenograft source animals. A dynamic bacterial flora of
  pigs reared under barrier conditions was characterized, emphasizing the
  significance of monitoring for multiresistant antimicrobial sensitivity
  patterns. Evidence was found for exclusion of two commonly residual exogenous
  viruses, porcine cytomegalovirus and porcine lymphotropic herpesviruses, among
  a proportion of the cohorts tested. Finally, there was histopathological
  evidence for low grade pneumonitis among sentinel pigs, likely to have been
  associated with the use of quaternary ammonium disinfectants during the
  production process, indicating a need for review of toxicology data for
  disinfectant agents used in such bioexclusion systems. Intensive health
  monitoring programs, based upon regularly updated recommendations from the
  microbiological research community, will enable significant reductions in the
  potential hazards associated with pig-to-human xenotransplantation.

AB: False-positive diagnosis of lymph nodes occurs when a benign element in a
  lymph node, or in its capsule, is interpreted as metastatic carcinoma. This
  report describes a patient with breast carcinoma who had megakaryocytes in
  axillary sentinel lymph nodes mimicking metastatic carcinoma. The patient had
  no history of a hematologic disease, and we found no evidence of a concurrent
  hematopoietic disorder. The megakaryocytes were reactive for CD31, CD61, and
  von Willebrand factor, but not for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3). Megakaryocytes should
  be added to the list of benign histologic abnormalities that may simulate
  metastatic carcinoma in a sentinel lymph node.

AB: The Toll-like receptor (TLR) superfamily is critical for cellular responses
  to a variety of pathogens. Mast cells (MC) are sentinel cells critical for host
  survival in bacterial infection. We examined the expression of TLR and
  associated molecules by human MC. CBMC and the human mast cell line, HMC-1,
  expressed mRNA for TLR1, TLR2, and TLR6, but not TLR4. These cells also
  expressed mRNA for the adapter molecules MD-2 and MyD88. CBMC were stimulated
  for 24 hr with various TLR activators including, Staphylococcus aureus
  peptidoglycan (PGN), E. coli LPS and CpG containing oligonucleotides,
  activators of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 respectively. Stimulation with PGN (10mug/ml)
  resulted in significant production of IL-1 beta (p<0.05) and GM-CSF (p<0.0001)
  while LPS (5mug/ml) and CpG oligonucleotides (10mug/ml) had no such effect.
  CBMC produced 6.4+-0.2 ng/ml GM-CSF and 585+-100 pg/ml IL-1 beta following
  stimulation with PGN compared to 0.49+-0.28 ng/ml and 88+-13 pg/ml respectively
  by unstimulated cells (n>3). Similarly, CBMC produced significant levels of
  these cytokines when stimulated with an additional TLR2 activator, synthetic
  lipopeptide, Pam3CysSerLys4-OH. Treatment of CBMC by TLR2 activators did not
  significantly modulate IL-6 production or short-term (20min) degranulation.
  These data suggest that treatment of CBMC by TLR2 activators results in
  selective production of cytokines involved in host defense.

AB: The leptin receptor defective (db/db) mouse is a well-established model for
  diabetes. These mice are hyperphagic, obese and insulin resistant. We observed
  an increase in morbidity and mortality in 10-23 week old male db/db mice.
  Macroscopic findings in 49 (32%) of 151 mice included focal to multifocal
  unilateral or bilateral renal abscessation. In 11% of the animals, abscesses
  extended to the liver and subcutaneous tissue. Histologically, there was
  chronic suppurative cystitis and pyelonephritis, pyonephrosis and perirenal
  abscess formation. Klebsiella oxytoca was isolated from 17 of 25 diseased
  animals; 15 of which were pure cultures. Culture analysis of six clinically
  normal, sentinel db/db mice determined that the cecum was the source of the K.
  oxytoca. K. oxytoca was confirmed by PCR analysis of the 16s ribosomal RNA gene
  (GenBank U78183). Two distinctive riboprint patterns were identified in
  sentinel and diseased animals suggesting that both strains of K. oxytoca were
  capable of causing disease. K. oxytoca rarely causes primary infections, but is
  an important nosocomial pathogen particularly in neonatal and elderly patients.
  Most of these patients have underlying diseases including hepatobiliary,
  neoplastic, and diabetes mellitus. Therefore, opportunistic infection of db/db
  mice with K. oxytoca may be a useful model for understanding the pathogenesis
  of nosocomial infections in diabetic patients.

AB: The setting up of efficient early warning systems is a challenge to research
  for preventing environmental alteration and human disease. In this paper, we
  report the development and the field application of a new biomonitoring
  methodology for assessing soil genotoxicity. In the first part, the use of
  amplified fragment length polymorphism and flow cytometry techniques to detect
  DNA damage induced by soils artificially contaminated with heavy metals as
  potentially genotoxic compounds is explained. Results show that the combination
  of the two techniques leads to efficient detection of the sublethal genotoxic
  effect induced in the plant bioindicator by contaminated soil. By contrast, the
  classic mortality, root, and shoot growth vegetative endpoints prove
  inappropriate for assessing soil genotoxicity because, although they cause
  genotoxic damage, some heavy metals do not affect sentinel plant development
  negatively. The statistical elaboration of the data obtained led to the
  development of a statistical predictive model which differentiates four
  different levels of soil genotoxic pollution and can bed used everywhere. The
  second part deals with the application of the biomonitoring protocol in the
  genotoxic assessment of two areas surrounding a steelworks in northern Italy
  and the effectiveness of this methodology. In this particular case, in these
  areas, the predictive model reveals a pollution level strictly correlated to
  the heavy metal concentrations revealed by traditional chemical analysis.

AB: Mink and otters are good integrators of their aquatic environments and
  useful sentinel species for determining exposure to environmental contaminants.
  In this study, perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS; C8F17SO3-),
  perfluorooctanesulfonamide (FOSA; C8F17SO2NH2), perfluorohexane-sulfonate
  (PFHxS; C6F13SO3-), and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA; C7F15CO2-) were measured in
  livers of mink and river otters collected from various locations in the United
  States. PFOS was found in all mink livers analyzed. Frequencies of occurrence
  of FOSA, PFHxS, and PFOA were less. The greatest concentration of PFOS measured
  in liver of mink was 5140 ng/g, wet weight. Maximum concentrations of FOSA,
  PFHxS, and PFOA in mink livers were 590, 39, and 27 ng/g, wet weight,
  respectively. There were no significant positive relationships between
  concentrations of PFOS and PFHxS or PFOA in mink livers. Concentrations of PFOS
  were positively correlated with those of FOSA in mink livers from Illinois.
  There was no significant correlation between concentrations of PFOS and lipid
  content in mink livers. There were no age- or sex-related differences in the
  concentrations of fluorochemicals in mink livers. Greater concentrations are
  associated with those individuals collected near urbanized and/or
  industrialized areas. PFOS was detected in livers of all river otters collected
  from Washington and Oregon at concentrations ranging from 25 to 994 ng/g, wet
  wt.

AB: Africa possesses little capacity for influenza surveillance-Senegal and
  South Africa being the only countries in the WHO African region who regularly
  pursue active surveillance and characterize influenza isolates. South Africa
  has three sites-in Cape Town, Durban and the largest in Johannesburg at the
  National Institute for Virology (NIV). The NIV antigenically and molecularly
  characterizes influenza viruses isolated from specimens provided by a sentinel
  network of approximately 50 clinical sites. This information, together with the
  isolates themselves are supplied to WHO International Influenza Centres in
  London and Melbourne. In addition, proxy markers of influenza severity such as
  school absenteeism and doctor/clinic visits are monitored to assess the
  severity of epidemics. Although, influenza exacts a heavier toll of the illness
  burden in developing countries already beset with underlying chronic medical
  conditions and also has a more severe impact on economies largely dependent on
  single income earners and subsistence farmers, influenza surveillance and
  vaccination awareness is woefully lacking on the African continent, and this
  urgently needs to be remedied.

AB: The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of dynamic imaging in
  sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in breast cancer. Patients with T1/T2, N0
  invasive breast cancer underwent SLN localisation using intra-dermal injection
  of 15 MBq of 99mTc-nanocolloid. Gamma camera anterior-oblique dynamic imaging
  commenced simultaneously with tracer administration for 45 min, and was
  followed by anterior and lateral static imaging. Dynamic imaging data was
  reformatted into image files of different time-frames. Patterns of uptake were
  analysed using the sequences of dynamic frames and time-activity curve (TAC).
  SLN localisation was successful in 70/73 studies (96%) in 72 patients. Imaging
  information was present within the first 15 min of dynamic imaging in 67/70
  studies (96%). Critical analysis of dynamic data helped to differentiate true
  SLN from secondary echelon nodes in eight studies and transient foci of
  radioactivity in six studies. In 17 studies, SLN contained metastatic disease.
  The detection of SLN metastasis was independent from the use of dynamic
  imaging. Dynamic imaging improves the interpretation of preoperative SLN
  imaging for breast cancer, but does not contribute significantly to the
  successful detection of SLN. Hence, preoperative dynamic imaging is not
  necessary in SLN biopsy for breast cancer.

AB: Bacterial biofilms are a common cause of persistent disease in humans. They
  are responsible for a number of illnesses including cystic fibrosis,
  endocarditis, osteomyelitis and various nosocomial diseases related to central
  venous catheters, urinary catheters, prosthetic heart valves, and orthopedic
  devices. Staphylococcus aureus is a common pathogen responsible for nosocomial
  as well as community infections. This pathogen readily colonizes indwelling
  catheters and forms microbiotic communities termed biofilms. S. aureus bacteria
  in biofilms are more resistant to clearance from antibiotics and attack from
  the body's immune system than their respective planktonic counterparts. For
  years, the mechanism behind biofilm resistance to attack from the immune
  system's sentinel leukocytes has been conceptualized as a lack in the ability
  of the leukocytes to penetrate the biofilm. We demonstrate here that leukocytes
  attach to and penetrate a fully mature (7-day-old) S. aureus biofilm. We also
  demonstrate that a maturing (2-day-old) biofilm elicits a cytokine response
  after 2 hrs post incubation with human leukocytes. Specifically, cytokines IL
  -1beta, IL-12 and IFN-gamma were induced, suggesting an attempt to mount a Th1
  -type response. These data represent the first demonstration of leukocytes
  penetrating a mature biofilm and also represent the first characterization of a
  cytokine response to a S. aureus biofilm.

AB: Background The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether HIV-1
  prevalence among antenatal clinic (ANC) attendees in Cambodia provided a
  reasonable estimate of HIV-1 prevalence among all women 15-49 years. Methods
  Antenatal clinic attendees in five HIV sentinel surveillance sites (five
  provinces) were selected by consecutive sampling (n = 1695). The population
  survey of females by household was carried out in the same five areas.
  Household females aged 15-49 years were selected using a three-stage cluster
  sampling design (n = 3066). Serum-based HIV ELISA testing was done for both ANC
  attendees and household females. The HIV prevalence for ANC attendees and
  household females were compared by age group and urban versus rural location.
  Results The overall prevalence of HIV-1 infection among ANC attendees (1.62%,
  95% CI: 1.26-1.98) was similar to the overall prevalence obtained from the
  general population of household females (1.24%, 95% CI: 0.92-1.55) in the same
  catchment areas in Cambodia. In the rural areas, the overall HIV prevalence
  among ANC attendees (2.18%, 95% CI: 1.59-2.77) was significantly higher than
  among the household females (0.86%, 95% CI: 0.49-1.23) after adjustment for age
  distribution and education level. In the 15-24 age group in rural areas, the
  HIV prevalence of ANC women was 2.71% (95% CI: 0.96-4.46) compared with 0.77%
  (95% CI: 0.02-1.53) in household females. Conclusions Although ANC data can be
  used to estimate trends over time, it should be realized that ANC data may
  overestimate the actual prevalence in the younger age group in rural areas in
  Cambodia.

AB: Sentinel node (SN) mapping and biopsy seems at present the best way to
  assess the nodal status in cutaneous melanoma without removing the lymphatic
  chain. The procedure is minimally invasive, safe and low cost, and allows
  selection of patients who can benefit from elective node dissection. From March
  1997 up to July 1999 we examined 112 SNs excised after lymphatic mapping from
  95 patients (48 males and 47 females) with stage I cutaneous melanoma affecting
  the trunk or limbs. Of these, 88 SNs from 74 patients were submitted to
  polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in order to detect tyrosinase mRNA. A new
  antibody (anti-tyrosinase, Clone T311, IgG2a type, Lab Vision Corporation) was
  used to detect nodal micrometastases. The search for micrometastases was
  histologically positive in 15 SNs and negative in 97. The 88 SNs examined using
  molecular biology were positive in 40 cases and negative in 48. In 28 only the
  PCR was positive. The new antibody used to detect micrometastases was shown to
  be very useful. Cases positive on both conventional histology and PCR were
  Clark level II or more and were thicker than 0.6 mm. No difference with regard
  to site or sex was observed. Lymphoedema and hypersensitivity reactions, nor
  the inability to work, did not occur. Only patients with histologically proven
  micrometastases underwent elective node dissection. Cases positive only on
  molecular biology were submitted to close follow-up.

AB: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare malignant tumour that develops in sun
  -exposed areas in immunocompromised patients (chronic lymphocytic leukaemia,
  transplant recipients) older than 50 years. We report MCC in a young black
  woman with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. A 2-cm binodular
  violaceous lesion developed on her left ear lobe. Extensive work-up, including
  computed tomographic scans of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis, octreotide
  scan and sentinel node biopsy, did not demonstrate any metastasis. A wide
  excision was performed and the patient remained free of disease after 9 months.
  This case is the fourth observation of MCC in an HIV-infected patient.

AB: Aim: To investigate whether multiparameter flow cytometry (MP-FCM) can be
  used for the detection of micrometastasis in sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in
  breast cancer. Methods: Formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded sentinel lymph
  nodes (n=238) from 98 patients were analysed. For each lymph node, sections for
  haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for
  cytokeratin (MNF 116) were cut at three levels with a distance of 500 mum. The
  intervening material was used for MP-FCM. Cells were immunostained with MNF
  116, followed by an incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labelled
  goat antimouse immunoglobulin. DNA was stained using propidium iodide. From
  each lymph node 100 000 cells were analysed on the flow cytometer. Results:
  Thirty eight of the 98 patients with breast carcinoma showed evidence of
  metastatic disease in the SLN by one ore more of the three methods. In 37 of 38
  cases where metastatic cells were seen in the routine H&E and/or IHC, more than
  1% cytokeratin positive cells were detected by MP-FCM. In 24 patients,
  metastatic foci were more than 2 mm (macrometastasis) and in 14 these foci were
  smaller than 2 mm (micrometastasis). In three of these 14 cases, MP-FCM
  revealed positive SLNs, although this was not seen at first glance in the H&E
  or IHC sections. After revision of the slides, one of these three remained
  negative. However, MP-FCM analysis of the cytokeratin positive cells showed an
  aneuploid DNA peak, which was almost identical to that of the primary breast
  tumour. Duplicate measurements, done in 41 cases, showed a 99% reproducibility.
  In five of 14 patients with micrometastasis, one or two metastatic foci were
  found in the non-SLN. However, in 15 of 24 macrometastases multiple non-SLNs
  were found to have metastatic tumour. All micrometastases except for the
  remaining negative one mentioned above showed only diploid tumour cells,
  despite the fact that their primary tumours contained both diploid and
  aneuploid tumour cells. In primary tumours with more than 60% aneuploid cells,
  predominantly aneuploid macrometastasis were found, whereas diploid primary
  tumours only showed diploid micrometastases or macrometastases in their SLN.
  Aneuploid SLN macrometastases were associated with non-SLN metastases in five
  of seven patients, whereas diploid cases showed additional non-SLN metastases
  in only seven of 16 patients. Conclusion: In all cases, MP-FCM was sufficient
  to detect micrometastatic tumour cells in a large volume of lymph node tissue
  from SLNs. In some cases it was superior to H&E and IHC staining. Approximately
  30% of SLN micrometastases are accompanied by additional non-SLN metastases.
  The size of the aneuploid fraction (>60%) in the primary tumour may influence
  the risk of having both SLN and non-SLN metastases.

AB: Toll-like receptors (TLR) are sentinel receptors capable of recognizing
  pathogen-associated molecule patterns (PAMP) such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
  and CpG-containing oligonucleotides (CpG ODN). TLR2 and TLR4 are major
  receptors for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial cell wall components,
  respectively. TLR9 is necessary for CpG signalling. LPS or CpG ODN can activate
  immature dendritic cells (DC) and induce DC maturation characterized by
  production of cytokines, up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules, and
  increased ability to activate T cells. However, little is known regarding the
  regulation of TLR gene expression in mouse DC. In this study, we investigated
  the regulation of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 gene expression by LPS in murine immature
  DC. TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 mRNA were up-regulated following LPS stimulation. The
  up-regulation of TLR9 expression coincided with significantly increased
  production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha induced by LPS plus CpG ODN. While
  inhibition of extracellular signal-related kinase and NF-kappaB activation
  suppressed the up-regulation of the expression of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 mRNA,
  inhibition of p38 kinase prevented the up-regulation of TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA
  expression but enhanced the up-regulation of TLR9 expression. These results
  demonstrated that TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 gene expression was differently regulated
  by LPS in mouse immature DC. Up-regulation of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 expression by
  LPS might promote the overall responses of DC to bacteria and help to explain
  the synergy between LPS and other bacterial products in the induction of
  cytokine production.

AB: In the former West Germany, in specific venereal diseases legislation passed
  in 1953, only syphilis, gonorrhoea, ulcus molle, and lymphogranuloma venereum
  were defined as venereal diseases and subject to mandatory notification. The
  proportion of unreported cases was as high as 75% for syphilis and up to 90%
  for gonorrhoea. Epidemiological data for the past 10 years exist only on
  selected populations from research studies and are summarized in this article.
  In the former East Germany reporting of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
  was mandatory and, due to the centralized organization, underreporting was
  considered to be low, although no specific studies have examined this. After
  the unification in 1990 of the two German states the West German laws were
  adopted in East Germany. Since 1982-when the first AIDS case was reported in
  Germany-information on AIDS cases has voluntarily been collected at the
  national register at the AIDS Centre of the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin.
  The law governing the reporting of infectious diseases has recently been
  revised. Under the new Protection against Infection Act, which became effective
  on 1 January 2001, clinical diagnoses of STIs (with the exception of hepatitis
  B) are no longer notifiable diseases. Laboratory reporting of positive test
  results for Treponema pallidum has been introduced. With T. pallidum and HIV
  notifications, additional disaggregated data are collected. Since T. pallidum
  and HIV remain the only notifiable STIs, all other STIs have to be monitored
  through sentinel surveillance systems. These surveillance systems are currently
  being established. Under the new legislation, local health authorities have to
  provide adequate counselling and testing services for STIs, which may be
  provided free of charge if necessary.

AB: In fish, the embryos and larvae are the life-stages most sensitive to damage
  from environmentally borne dioxin-like compounds and polycyclic aromatic
  hydrocarbons (PAHs). Methods are not routinely available to measure the body
  burdens of contaminants in embryos and larvae, thus precluding the
  investigation of links between exposure and biological effects. Quantification
  of expression of cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1) provides an index of relative
  exposure of natural populations to bioavailable aromatic hydrocarbons (AH) and
  an initial evaluation of their biological effects. We developed a quantitative
  approach to standardize total RNA loading and then used competitive reverse
  transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to quantify the CYP1A1 mRNA
  expression in environmentally exposed Atlantic tomcod (Microgadus tomcod) post
  yolk-sac larvae (postlarvae) from the Hudson River, New York, and in chemically
  treated postlarval offspring of controlled laboratory crosses of Hudson River
  parents. Significant induction of CYP1A1 expression was observed in tomcod
  postlarvae exposed to waterborne 3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB 77) (four
  -fold) and benzo(a)pyrene (eight-fold) compared with vehicle-exposed controls.
  In contrast, CYP1A1 was not induced in Hudson River-exposed postlarvae compared
  with vehicle-exposed controls. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using
  competitive RT-PCR for the measurement of gene expression in environmentally
  exposed larvae of sentinel species, and is consistent with the hypothesis that
  postlarvae exposed to the Hudson River environment have not bioaccumulated
  sufficient levels of AHs to induce CYP1A1 expression. The high levels of
  hepatic CYP1A1 mRNA expression previously reported in 5-8 month old juvenile
  tomcod from the Hudson River coincides with their descent to the benthic
  habitat and the onset of independent feeding on AH-contaminated benthic prey.

AB: We used population-based data to evaluate how often groups of randomly
  selected clinical laboratories accurately estimated the prevalence of resistant
  pneumococci and captured trends in resistance over time. Surveillance for
  invasive pneumococcal disease was conducted in eight states from 1996 to 1998.
  Within each surveillance area, we evaluated the proportion of all groups of
  three, four, and five laboratories that estimated the prevalence of penicillin
  -nonsusceptible pneumococci (%PNSP) and the change in %PNSP over time. We
  assessed whether sentinel groups detected emerging fluoroquinolone resistance.
  Groups of five performed best. Sentinel groups accurately predicted %PNSP in
  five states; states where they performed poorly had high between-laboratory
  variation in %PNSP. Sentinel groups detected large changes in prevalence of
  nonsusceptibility over time but rarely detected emerging fluoroquinolone
  resistance. Characteristics of hospital-affiliated laboratories were not useful
  predictors of a laboratory's %PNSP. Sentinel surveillance for resistant
  pneumococci can detect important trends over time but rarely detects newly
  emerging resistance profiles.

AB: With the aim of studying levels of antioxidant and peroxisomal enzymes and
  the structure of peroxisomes in relation to body burdens of polycyclic aromatic
  hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), mussels Mytilus
  galloprovincialis, oysters Crassostrea sp., crabs Carcinus maenas and mullets
  Mugil cephalus were sampled in two Basque estuaries (Bay of Biscay): Urdaibai
  (Laida, Txatxarramendi, Arteaga, and downstream a sewage treatment plant-STP)
  and Plentzia. In general, animals showed higher concentrations of contaminants
  in winter than in summer and no relevant differences were detected among
  locations. Conversely, antioxidant enzyme activities were higher in summer.
  Enzyme expression was studied in mullets using immunochemical methods. By
  immunoblotting season-dependent differences were detected for Mn-superoxide
  dismutase (Mn-SOD). As for the immunohistochemical staining, mullets sampled in
  summer in Plentzia showed significantly higher optical densities for acyl-CoA
  oxidase and lower for both Cu, Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD than those collected
  downstream a STP as well as higher catalase immunostaining than those collected
  in winter. Peroxisomal volume density (Vvp) of mussels sampled in Laida and
  Txatxarramendi did not show seasonal variations, while for oysters collected in
  Laida and Arteaga Vvp was higher in summer. Crab and mullet Vvp were also
  higher in summer. In conclusion, the estuaries of Urdaibai and Plentzia can be
  considered as low to moderately polluted areas and levels of PAHs and PCBs do
  not show marked variations apart from seasonal variations. Animals can be
  adapted to low pollution conditions and, under these circumstances, seasonal
  factors might affect biomarker responses to a greater extent than pollution
  variations.

AB: Sentinel herds of large ruminants were established at five centres in Yunnan
  Province, Peoples Republic of China, between 1995 and 1997. The application of
  a sensitive antigen capture ELISA to facilitate virus isolation procedures led
  to the isolation of 108 strains of bluetongue (BLU) virus. Serotypes isolated
  included types 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 21 and 23. Virus transmission
  occurred over a period of 1-3 months at each of the four positive sites, giving
  an overall BLU virus transmission period for the province of 5 months, from
  early June to early November. The greatest level of transmission took place in
  July and August. The duration of viraemia in individual animals varied from 1
  to 7 weeks, with a mean calculated for each serotype between 6 and 20 days. The
  study represents the first detailed investigation of the epidemiology of BLU in
  China utilizing sentinel herds.

AB: Background: In invasive breast cancer lymphatic mapping with patent blue
  vital dye (PBV) is used intraoperatively to identify the sentinel lymph nodes:
  the first axillary node draining the mammary lymphatic basin and first involved
  by the metastatic growth in breast cancer. Patent blue vital dye spreads to
  tissues giving a bluish tinge to patients. We have noted the possibility that
  intraoperative peripheral pulse oximetric (SpO2) values are artificially low
  when intradermal PBV is used. Methods: Twenty patients with normal pulmonary
  function undergoing breast cancer surgery in standardized anesthesia either did
  or did not receive intradermal PBV sentinel node marking. The radial artery was
  cannulated for blood-gas-analysis; arterial oxygen tension (PaO2); and arterial
  oxygen saturation (SaO2). Peripheral oxygen saturation was measured using the
  light absorption technique. Red and infrared light (660 and 900 nm), used by
  pulseoxymetry, is partially absorbed when passing through the tissue. The
  amount of light absorbed is sensored and saturation calculated. The color of
  the skin was evaluated. Results: Peripheral oxygen saturation decreased only
  immediately after the injection of PBV, and remained at a significantly lower
  level (P<0.001) throughout the operation and up to 90 min postoperatively.
  Arterial oxygen tension and SaO2 values did not decrease after intradermal PBV.
  Patent blue vital dye made patients' skin more bluish (P<0.001). No changes in
  SpO2, PaO2 and SaO2 were found in control patients. Conclusion: The spectrum of
  PBV has a peak absorption at 640 nm, thus making the SpO2 values incorrect.
  Peripheral oxygen saturation values are falsely low and true arterial
  oxygenation is not impaired when PBV is used during sentinel node mapping.

AB: An outbreak of paralysis among 16- to 20-week-old CFW Swiss Webster sentinel
  mice developed in one of our barrier facilities. Two months after arrival and
  over a period of four weeks, six of 400 mice purchased from an approved vendor,
  developed progressive hind limb paralysis without other clinical signs of
  disease. On the basis of the histopathologic changes and negative serologic
  test results, lymphoblastic lymphoma causing compression of the spinal cord was
  diagnosed. There were two leading features to this outbreak: its unusual
  epidemiologic presentation, and the localization of the lesions principally in
  the lumbar muscles. A presumptive diagnosis of retroviral infection with
  Abelson's murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) was established on the basis of
  histopathologic and immunohistochemical findings. Little is known about
  retroviral status in many commercial colonies, and few users report presence of
  spontaneous lymphomas. This report points out complications derived from
  commercially available animals that carry endogenous retroviruses. It also
  emphasizes the need of diagnosing and reporting clusters of hind limb paralysis
  or lymphomas in mice to assess the prevalence and relevance of retroviral
  infections in commercial colonies.

AB: We compared a municipal sentinel surveillance system for influenza with the
  Microbial Isolation Surveillance System (MISS) in Kyoto City, Japan.
  Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value positive (PVP) of the Influenza
  Sentinel Surveillance System (ISSS) compared to the MISS were calculated by
  influenza season and by month. Sensitivity ranged from 80 to 97%, specificity
  ranged from 55 to 77%, and PVP ranged from 29 to 52% by season (P < 0.001). On
  the other hand, sensitivity ranged from 86 to 100%, specificity ranged from 38
  to 66%, and PVP ranged from 31 to 50% by month (P<0.001). Specificity was
  calculated as 93% in November. The sensitivity of ISSS was found to be
  sufficient regardless of the magnitude of influenza activity. Specificity
  varied by season, indicating the difficulty of clinically diagnosing other
  respiratory illnesses. The PVP remained at less than 50% before and after the
  influenza seasons and it varied year by year. In general, the ISSS is a good
  surveillance system for monitoring influenza activity.

AB: Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) concentrate, transport, and release
  certain antimicrobial agents as they move in a chemotactic gradient.
  Antipyretic agents are frequently used in febrile patients receiving
  antimicrobial agents. Thus, the influence of ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and
  acetylsalicylic acid on uptake, transport, and release of azithromycin and
  moxifloxacin was studied. Uptake of the antimicrobial agents by human PMNL and
  the effect of the antipyretics were quantitated by bioassay of released
  antimicrobial agent. Transport and release were determined in chemotactic
  plates overlaid with sentinel bacteria that could detect transported and
  released antimicrobial agent. None of the antipyretics altered PMNL directed or
  nondirected movement. Uptake of azithromycin was significantly inhibited by
  acetylsalicylic acid but not by the other antipyretics. All of the antipyretic
  agents studied at therapeutic levels inhibited transport and release of both
  azithromycin and moxifloxacin. Administration of any of these antipyretic
  agents with antimicrobial agents that are transported and released by PMNL
  could compromise the efficacy of therapy.

AB: No standard method for handling and histopathologic examination of the
  sentinel node (SN) exists. We hypothesized that a focused examination of all
  nodes with serial sectioning and cytokeratin immunohistochemical staining would
  confirm the SN as the node most likely to harbor metastasis. Intraoperative
  lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymphadenectomy using blue dye and 99mtechnetium
  -labeled sulfur colloid were performed. All nodes were stained with H&E. All
  tumor-free nodes underwent additional sectioning and staining with H&E and an
  immunohistochemical stain. Routine H&E examination detected SN metastases in
  27.6% of cases. Occult SN metastases were identified in 12.7% of cases. None of
  the 724 non-SNs examined contained occult metastases. The SN false-negative
  rate was zero. This study confirms histopathologically that the SN has biologic
  significance as the axillary node most likely to harbor metastatic tumor.
  Standardization of the handling, sectioning, and staining of the SN is
  necessary as lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymphadenectomy become integrated
  into the care of patients with breast cancer.

AB: Ideally, a phytosanitary performance standard would be defined as a
  probabilistic tolerance. For treatments such as solid wood pasteurization, this
  could be operationalized by stating with a specific degree of confidence that
  the treatment failure rate for a sentinel pest should be less than a defined
  level (e.g., X% confidence that the wood heat treatment failure rate for pest Y
  does not exceed Z%). This article illustrates a probabilistic approach to
  developing a phytosanitary performance standard, using heat treatment of the
  wood-inhabiting fungus Posita placenta as an example. The uncertainty about the
  proportion of wood blocks in which P. placenta survives after treatment is
  characterized by the Beta distribution, subject to the the biological
  constraint that survival should decrease monotonically with increased time and
  temperature. Monte Carlo simulation techniques are then used to generate a
  probabilistic response surface relating proportion survival to treatment time
  and temperature. This modeling approach relaxes the parametric assumptions
  associated with traditional statistical methods for fitting response surfaces
  and is more flexible than conventional methods, resulting in a better fit to
  the observed data.

AB: Natural enemies associated with eggs of Nezara viridula (L.) (Heteroptera:
  Pentatomidae) were evaluated by placing sentinel egg masses in weeds and
  cultivated tomato and bean crops in northern California. Egg predation was
  generally less than 10% and normally involved predators with chewing mouth
  parts. Predators seldom destroyed an entire egg mass, typically eating <40 eggs
  per exploited mass. Laboratory evaluation of >25 species of potential arthropod
  predators revealed that few fed on N. viridula eggs to any extent; however,
  numerous species fed on N. viridula nymphs. Five species of egg parasites were
  recovered from sentinel egg masses: Trissolcus basalis (Wollaston), Gryon
  obesum Masner and Telenomus podisi Ashmead (Scelionidae); and Ooencyrtus
  californicus Girault and O. johnsoni (Howard) (Encyrtidae). The major egg
  parasite was T. basalis, the only exotic member of the parasite guild; it
  typically parasitized 100% of the eggs in an exploited egg mass. The results
  indicate that parasitization of eggs and predation of small nymphs can be
  important biotic mortality factors for N. viridula populations in northern
  California. It is suggested that a combination of factors - viz., egg
  parasitization, nymphal predation, regional shortage of overwintering sites,
  and local shortages of suitable hosts - maintains this exotic pest at
  relatively low levels in the region.

AB: TGEV replicates in intestinal enterocytes and causes diarrhea in young pigs.
  PRCV, a spike (S) gene deletion mutant of TGEV with an altered respiratory
  tissue tropism, causes mild or subclinical respiratory infections. Comparisons
  of TGEV and PRCV strains suggest that tropism and pathogenicity are influenced
  by the S gene and ORF3, respectively. Recently, outbreaks of TGE of reduced
  virulence were reported in the field. We investigated a similar suspect TGEV
  outbreak of reduced virulence in nursery pigs from a swine herd in the Midwest.
  A TGEV strain (BW021898B) was isolated in swine testicular cells from gut
  contents of a diarrheic pig and three PRCV strains (BW126, BW154, BW155) were
  isolated from nasal swabs from normal TGEV-seronegative sentinel pigs in
  contact with the diarrheic pigs. Sequence analysis of the TGEV isolate in the
  partial S gene and ORF3/3a and ORF3-1/3b revealed high homology with
  enteropathogenic TGEV strains. Gnotobiotic pig inoculation and
  histopathological results revealed that this TGEV isolate retained virulence
  even though in the field outbreak the diarrheal disease was of reduced
  severity. Sequence analysis of the S gene deletion region of the three PRCV
  isolates revealed identical deletions between nt 105-752, which differ from
  deletions previously reported among PRCV strains. The three PRCV isolates had
  variable sequence changes in ORF 3/3a and ORF 3-1/3b, affecting the ORF size
  and amino acid sequence. Thus, sequence analysis and pathogenicity studies
  indicate that this TGEV isolate resembles other enteropathogenic TGEV strains.
  Therefore, the reduced severity of TGE observed in this herd may be due to the
  ongoing PRCV infections, which induce antibodies cross-reactive with TGEV and
  result in decreased disease severity. The results outlined in this study
  highlight the need to monitor the molecular epidemiology of TGEV/PRCV strains
  with sensitive differential diagnostic assays, followed by sequence analysis of
  the critical regions to identify changes and pathogenicity studies to confirm
  the disease potential of the TGEV isolates.

AB: From 1982-1998, enhanced sentinel surveillance for acute hepatitis B was
  conducted in 4 counties in the United States to determine trends in disease
  incidence and risk factors for infection. During this period, the reported
  incidence of acute hepatitis B declined by 76.1% from 13.8 cases per 100,000 in
  1987 to 3.3 cases per 100,000 in 1998. Cases associated with injection drug use
  (IDU) decreased by 90.6%, men who have sex with men (MSM) by 63.5%, and
  heterosexual activity by 50.7%. During 1994-1998, the most commonly reported
  risk factor for infection was high-risk heterosexual activity (39.8%) followed
  by MSM activity (14.6%) and IDU (13.8%). Over half of all patients (55.5%)
  reported treatment for a sexually transmitted disease (STD) or incarceration in
  a prison or jail prior to their illness, suggesting that more than half of the
  acute hepatitis B cases might have been prevented through routine hepatitis B
  immunization in STD clinics and correctional health care programs.

AB: Background: The current diagnostic criteria for pediatric autoimmune
  neuropsychiatric disorder associated with group A streptococcal infection
  (PANDAS) are pediatric onset, neuropsychiatric disorder (obsessive-compulsive
  disorder (OCD)) and/or tic disorder; abrupt onset and/or episodic course of
  symptoms; association with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS)
  infection; and association with neurological abnormalities (motoric
  hyperactivity or adventitious movements, including choreiform movements or
  tics). Objective: To assess new-onset PANDAS cases in relation to acute GABHS
  tonsillopharyngitis. Design: Prospective PANDAS case identification and follow
  -up. Results: Over a 3-year period (1998-2000), we identified 12 school-aged
  children with new-onset PANDAS. Each patient had the abrupt appearance of
  severe OCD behaviors, accompanied by mild symptoms and signs of acute GABHS
  tonsillopharyngitis. Throat swabs tested positive for GABHS by rapid antigen
  detection and/or were culture positive. The GABHS serologic tests, when
  performed (n=3), showed very high antideoxyribonuclease antibody titers. Mean
  age at presentation was 7 years (age range, 5-11 years). In children treated
  with antibiotics effective in eradicating GABHS infection at the sentinel
  episode, OCD symptoms promptly disappeared. Follow-up throat cultures negative
  for GABHS were obtained prospectively after the first PANDAS episode.
  Recurrence of OCD symptoms was seen in 6 patients; each recurrence was
  associated with evidence of acute GABHS infection and responded to antibiotic
  therapy, supporting the premise that these patients were not GABHS carriers.
  The OCD behaviors exhibited included hand washing and preoccupation with germs,
  but daytime urinary urgency and frequency without dysuria, fever, or
  incontinence were the most notable symptoms in our series (58% of patients).
  Symptoms disappeared at night, and urinalysis and urine cultures were negative.
  Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study to confirm
  that PANDAS is associated with acute GABHS tonsillopharyngitis and responds to
  appropriate antibiotic therapy at the sentinel episode.

AB: Background: The technique of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in patients
  with breast cancer varies among reports, and the optimal method remains to be
  established, particularly with regard to the site of radiotracer injection. The
  aim of this study was to compare periareolar and peritumoral injection of
  radiotracer in detecting SLN in patients with breast cancer. Methods: Patients
  with T1-2 breast cancer (n=155) were enrolled in this study. In phase 1 (n=62),
  SLN biopsy was performed by using peritumoral injection of blue dye alone
  followed by backup axillary lymph node dissection. In phase 2, SLN biopsy was
  performed by using peritumoral injection of blue dye and peritumoral (group A,
  n=41) or periareolar (group B, n=52) injection of technetium 99m tin colloid.
  Results: In phase 1, the detection rate of SLN was 81% and the false-negative
  rate was 5.6%, indicating our skill in SLN biopsy. In phase 2, the success rate
  of lymphoscintigraphy was significantly (P<.001) higher in group B (90%) than
  in group A (51%). The mean ex vivo radioactivity of SLN in group B (117 counts
  per second; range, 5 to 900) was also significantly (P<.05) higher than in
  group A (51 counts per second; range, 8 to 260). In addition, the detection
  rate of SLN was significantly (P<.05) higher in group B (100%) than in group A
  (90%). Conclusions: Periareolar injection of radiotracer for SLN biopsy is
  superior to peritumoral injection because of its simplicity, achieving a high
  success rate in lymphoscintigraphy and SLN detection.

AB: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is a useful way of assessing axillary nodal
  status and obviates unnecessary axillary lymph node dissection for patients
  with node-negative breast cancer. However, SLN can also be located in the
  internal mammary lymph node (IMN) chain or elsewhere. The practicability and
  relevance of internal mammary SLN is reviewed and discussed. Axillary and IMN
  status have similar predictive value for survival, and the involvement of IMNs
  has prognostic value for both axillary node-negative and node-positive
  patients. Although parasternal recurrence is fortunately rare after modified
  radical mastectomy or breast conserving surgery, if left untreated it develops
  not infrequently as a clinically evident disease in patients with histologic
  involvement of IMNs. Internal mammary SLNs can be identified by means of
  lymphoscintigraphy and gamma-detection probe after peritumoral injection of
  radioisotopes. A positive internal mammary SLN biopsy would be an indication
  for internal mammary radiotherapy as well as adjuvant systemic treatment.
  However, the reported incidence of positive internal mammary SLNs is still
  lower than expected, because the spread of radioisotope activity is not
  synonymous with nodal positivity. Internal mammary SLN biopsy is considered to
  be still in the investigative stage. More data are needed on the correction of
  a 'hot' internal mammary SLN and pathologic positivity, so that further
  clinical investigation is clearly warranted.

AB: In this study the nodal staging sensitivity of sentinel lymph node biopsy
  (SLNB) with detailed pathological and molecular biological examination has been
  investigated and compared to that of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) with
  routine histological evaluation. Sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) were removed by
  the dual-agent injection technique in 68 patients with primary, clinically node
  -negative breast cancer. Forty-seven patients had negative SLNs according to
  hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. These H&E-negative SLNs were serially
  sectioned and examined at 250 mum levels by anticytokeratin
  immunohistochemistry (IHC). In 14 patients the SLNs were also investigated by
  cytokeratin 20 (CK20) reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
  SLNB with IHC increased the node-positive rate by 26% (by 40% in tumors less
  than or equal to 2 cm in size (pT1) and by 9% in tumors more than 2 cm but less
  than or equal to 5 cm in size (pT2)). The sensitivity of SLNB with IHC was
  superior to that of ALND with routine histology in pT1 tumors and identical in
  pT2 tumors. The concordance between histology and RT-PCR was only 21%, and in
  two of three cases with positive histological results RT-PCR was negative. In
  conclusion, SLNB with detailed pathological and/or molecular biological
  evaluation can improve the sensitivity of regional staging. ALND can probably
  be abandoned in patients with pT1 SLN-negative breast cancer. Further
  prospective studies are required to determine the clinical significance of
  these detailed SLN evaluation techniques, but at present these methods are
  still investigational.

AB: Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast is a rare neoplasm that represents
  <1% of breast carcinomas. The tumors are histologically indistinguishable from
  examples in other sites, and they have a generally favorable prognosis. Several
  studies have investigated the possible correlation between histologic grade in
  adenoid cystic carcinoma (largely determined by cytology and growth pattern)
  and prognosis. Some earlier reports concluded that a solid variant of mammary
  adenoid cystic carcinoma had a more aggressive clinical course, but others did
  not confirm this impression. This report describes nine patients with a solid
  variant of mammary adenoid cystic carcinoma that has a striking basaloid
  appearance. All were women ranging in age from 37 to 83 years. A solitary mass
  was evident in all patients. Tumor size was 1.1-15 cm (mean 3.7 cm). The tumors
  exhibited a predominantly solid architecture comprised of basaloid appearing
  cells with moderate to marked nuclear atypia. Five tumors had >5 mitotic
  figures per 10 high power microscopic fields. Intercalated ducts were found in
  all tumors, being well formed in six and poorly formed in three.
  Immunohistochemical stains for cytokeratins, basement membranes, and vimentin
  were consistently positive. Surgery was performed in all cases consisting of
  excision in seven and mastectomy in two. Axillary lymph node metastases were
  found in two of six axillary dissections and four had negative lymph nodes. The
  lymph nodes were not examined in three patients. Follow-up information was
  available for seven patients. Six women had no evidence of disease after follow
  -up of 2-88 months (mean 32 months), one patient died of unknown causes, and
  one patient was lost to follow-up. It is concluded that the solid variant of
  mammary carcinoma with basaloid features is a histologically distinct tumor
  that is capable of axillary metastases. Long-term follow-up of a larger series
  of cases will be needed to determine whether the prognosis of these patients
  differs significantly from that of women with conventional adenoid cystic
  carcinoma. Presently, these patients are candidates for axillary staging by
  sentinel lymph node mapping or low axillary dissection if there is no clinical
  evidence of axillary metastases. Systemic adjuvant treatment would be prudent
  when axillary nodal metastases are present. Breast-conserving surgery with
  radiation is an option if negative margins can be achieved because this appears
  to be a unicentric form of carcinoma.

AB: It is well known that different pathologists in different laboratories
  follow different protocols for the processing and examination of these
  specimens. There is also extensive literature (some of which is summarized in
  the references appended to the present report) on the likelihood of identifying
  metastases of varying sizes with different methods of preparation, as well as
  on the clinical significance of this identification, which varies not only from
  site to site but also from report to report on the same site. The Association
  of Directors of Anatomic and Surgical Pathology (ADASP) has reviewed this
  literature as well as the personal experience of its own members to present a
  set of recommendations for lymph node biopsies, lymph node dissections,
  sentinel node biopsies, lymph node fine needle aspiration (FNA) and core needle
  biopsies. It should be noted that these recommendations are intended
  specifically for lymph nodes being studied for metastatic neoplasms, and are
  not intended to apply to lymph nodes being evaluated for lymphoma, infections,
  and other disease processes. They are, however, formulated generically enough
  to apply regardless of whether the primary tumor is a carcinoma of the breast,
  carcinoma of the prostate, melanoma, or any other malignant, potentially
  metastasizing tumor. The Association has published numerous documents with
  recommendations for reporting surgical pathology specimens involving particular
  organ sites (for example, breast, pancreas, thyroid, etc.) However, the
  Association has not yet considered the generic question of dealing with lymph
  node specimens in which the intent is to search for and document the presence
  of metastatic disease. We are also unaware of guidelines for pathologists
  published by any other organization on this subject.

AB: In early breast cancer axillary nodes are usually impalpable and over 50% of
  such patients may have an axillary clearance when no nodes are involved. This
  work identifies axillary node status by imaging with a Tc-99m radiolabelled
  anti-Polymorphic Epithelial Mucin, humanised monoclonal antibody (human milk
  fat globule 1), prior to surgery in 30 patients. Change detection analysis of
  image data with probability mapping is undertaken. A specificity of 93% and
  positive predictive value of 92% (both 100% if a second cancer in the axilla
  with negative nodes is considered) were found. A strategy for combining
  negative imaging with the sentinel node procedure is presented.

AB: Objective: We set out to determine the ability of positron emission
  tomography with fluorodeoxyglucose to detect groin lymph node metastases from
  vulvar cancer. Methods: From January 2000 to August 2001, patients with
  squamous cell cancer of the vulva undergoing radical excision and
  lymphadenectomy were offered preoperative positron emission tomography. The
  imaging and pathologic status of each patient and groin were compared, and the
  sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of positron emission tomography
  in predicting nodal metastasis were determined. Results: Fifteen patients
  underwent positron emission tomography prior to exploration of 29 groins. Six
  patients had positive scans, suggesting metastases in 8 groins. Pathologically,
  5 patients had metastases in 9 groins, with positron emission tomography
  demonstrating metastases in 4 of 5 patients and 6 of 9 groins with disease. On
  a patient-by-patients basis, positron emission tomography had a sensitivity of
  80%, specificity of 90%, positive predictive value of 80%, and negative
  predictive value of 90% in demonstrating metastases. On a groin-by-groin basis,
  positron emission tomography had a sensitivity of 67%, specificity of 95%,
  positive predictive value of 86%, and negative predictive value of 86%.
  Positron emission tomography was more accurate in detecting extranodal
  metastases than disease confined within the groin nodes (P=0.048). Conclusions:
  Positron emission tomography is relatively insensitive in predicting lymph node
  metastasis, and a negative study is not a reliable surrogate for a
  pathologically negative groin. However, the high specificity suggests that
  positron emission tomography is useful in planning radiation therapy and as an
  adjunct to lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node dissection.

AB: In a number of clinical situations, especially in the context of the recent
  sentinel node concept, lymph-node involvement has to be determined
  intraoperatively. Since serious and dependable decisions are to be made
  according to the result of this examination, the most reliable method for the
  detection of tumour cells should be applied. We and others have shown
  previously that routine histological examination underestimates lymph-node
  metastases, and that immunohistochemistry (IHC) significantly improves the
  accuracy of staging. However, IHC has so far been difficult to apply to the
  intraoperative examination of cryosections since it has required too much time.
  We have developed a novel modification of IHC for the rapid detection of
  metastases of carcinomas in cryosections from lymph nodes. It is based on a
  unique directly labelled cytokeratin antibody, immunofluorescence, and a
  specially devised staining solution. This one-step staining procedure can be
  performed within 10 min. At the same time, its sensitivity is very high. Single
  tumour cells can easily be detected, and background staining is very low. The
  high sensitivity could result in a markedly improved reliability of sentinel
  node-based decisions.

AB: Chronic, low-level exposure of health care professionals to waste anesthetic
  gases has been linked to increased incidences of neurologic and reproductive
  dysfunction, hepatic and renal toxicity, and neoplasia. The present study
  assessed the potential for waste anesthetic gas exposure to researchers
  administering isoflurane to rats by using standard delivery systems and
  conventional anesthesia protocols. Well-maintained bench-top precision
  isoflurane vaporizers were equipped with two circuits (a nonrebreathing one
  hooked to a modified Bain facemask, and the other to an induction box) attached
  to commercially available, activated charcoal canisters (passive gas
  scavenging). The isoflurane concentration was varied from 1% to 5%, while the
  oxygen flow rate was either 1 or 2.5 L/min. Real-time atmospheric isoflurane
  levels were assessed by using a portable infrared spectrophotometer. When
  euthanized female sentinel CD rats were positioned in the facemask loop,
  isoflurane emissions at the mask-rat interface, breathing zone, and exhaust
  port of scavenging canisters were increased in proportion to the isoflurane
  concentration and oxygen flow rates as well as the amount of gas directed
  through the facemask circuit. Isoflurane was detected in the anesthetist's
  breathing zone only if the entire carrier gas flow was directed to the facemask
  loop. The background isoflurane level rose to 0.5 ppm after 75 min of
  continuous bench-top operation in a room with 22 air exchanges hourly but did
  not escalate if the anesthesia unit-or at least the gas-scavenging canister-was
  placed in a fume hood, or if the system was used in a room with 42 hourly air
  changes. Isoflurane efflux via the exhaust ports exceeded 5 ppm in 31% of gas
  -scavenging canisters that had not reached their maximum use life (as defined
  by the manufacturer's specifications); in a parallel prospective study,
  isoflurane was emitted from 88% of canisters by the time that they had reached
  50% of their specified lifespan. These data indicate that (1) isoflurane
  emissions likely will occur at trace levels in laboratory animal facilities
  even when well-maintained precision isoflurane vaporizers equipped with
  conventional activated charcoal (passive) gas-scavenging units are used and (2)
  exposure to anesthetic pollution can be mitigated substantially by selecting
  low-flow anesthesia regimens, improving gas-scavenging practices, and
  optimizing the configurations of the delivery system and work area.

AB: Background. The aim of our study was to assess the value of positron
  emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) for the staging of
  clinically nodal negative necks in oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell
  carcinoma (SCC) using sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy and elective neck
  dissection (END) as "gold standard" for comparison. Methods. Twelve patients
  (10 men, 2 women) with oral or oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and no
  evidence of lymph node metastasis in the physical and radiologic examinations
  were eligible. At least 24 hours before surgery PET with FDG were performed.
  The SLN was localized by preoperative lymphoscintigraphy with 99m-Tc-Nanocoll
  and intraoperative use of a hand-held gamma-probe and selectively excised. All
  patients then underwent END. Results. SLN and END revealed occult metastasis in
  5 of 12 cases. SLN biopsy was accurately feasible in all 12 patients and
  diagnosed all 5 cases of occult metastasis (sensitivity and specificity of
  100%). PET suggested two patients having occult metastasis, of which one turned
  out to be false positive (sensitivity 25%, specificity 88%). The mean size of
  the micrometastasis was 1.4 mm (range, 1.2-1.5 mm). Conclusions. PET with FDG
  turned out to have a poor sensitivity and specificity in revealing occult
  metastasis and has no role for the evaluation of otherwise clinically NO necks.
  The failure to detect micrometastasis by PET is due to the technical
  limitations of resolution (4-5 mm). SLN biopsy, with END in cases of positive
  SLN, provides a highly accurate staging of NO necks in oral and oropharyngeal
  carcinoma. Patients with negative SLN could be spared the risks and the
  morbidity of END.

AB: A bin washing apparatus (drencher) was used to treat late-instar codling
  moth, Cydia pomonella Linnaeus-infested wooden fruit bins with the
  entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema carpocapsae. Sentinel late-instar codling
  moth larvae were placed in strips of wood, made from dismantled bins, that were
  subsequently screwed into the corners of real bins before treatment. Pre
  -soaking the bins with water prior to treatment and covering the bins with a
  plastic tarp post-treatment, to maintain a high humidity, significantly
  increased sentinel codling moth mortality. Treatment for 1 min with 50 S.
  carpocapsae infective juveniles mL-1 water resulted in more than 80% mortality
  over 6 h in which the nematodes were continuously pumped through the drencher.
  The temperature of the water in the bin washer was ltoreq15degreeC and the
  chlorine in the city water was too low to harm the nematodes. The key
  disadvantage of washing the bins was the labour involved. It may be possible to
  reduce post-treatment holding time and increase codling moth mortality by
  holding the bins at a higher temperature post-treatment, however this parameter
  was not included in the study. The presence of the codling moth granulosis
  virus within the larvae did not influence the nematode-induced codling moth
  mortality over a range of concentrations and two temperatures in laboratory
  trials.

AB: The effect of prolonged exposure at two sites along the Reconquista River
  (Argentina), a highly polluted peri-urban water body, on brain
  acetylcholinesterase (AChE, EC 3.1.1.7, acetylcholine acetylhydrolase) of two
  teleosts was examined. Caged Cyprinus carpio and field-captured Cnesterodon
  decemmaculatus were used as sentinel organisms. Eserine concentration
  inhibiting 50% of AChE activity (IC50) and inhibition kinetic parameters were
  also evaluated. Interspecies IC50 differences were found to agree with observed
  kinetic parameters (KA, ki and kc), indicating that carps were more sensitive
  to eserine. Data obtained disclosed spatial differences and demonstrated the
  high sensitivity of AChE activity as an exposure biomarker. Marked species
  -related differences were detected, showing that enzyme determination of C.
  decemmaculatus is more effective in highly polluted sites. Considering the
  river water physicochemical profile, observed changes in AChE activities can be
  partly attributed to long-lasting raised concentrations of dissolved heavy
  metals.

AB: From February through May of 1999, 13 cases of Influenza A virus (FLUAV),
  type H1N1 were reported at a Department of Defense influenza surveillance
  sentinel site in Lima, Peru. Genetic and antigenic analysis by hemagglutination
  inhibition and direct nucleotide sequencing of the HA1 region of the
  hemagglutinin gene were performed on two isolates, A/Peru/1641/99 and
  A/Peru/1798/99. Both isolates were distinct from the Bayern/7/95-like viruses
  circulating in the Americas and closely related to a Beijing/262/95-like
  variant, A/New Caledonia/20/99. With the exception of travel-related cases, the
  detection of these isolates represents the first appearance of New
  Caledonia/20/99-like viruses in the Americas. Since the characterization of
  these Peru isolates, a number of New Caledonia/20/99-like viruses have been
  reported worldwide. For the 2000/01 and 2001/02 influenza seasons, the World
  Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the inclusion of A/New
  Caledonia/20/99 as the H1N1 vaccine component for both the southern and
  northern hemispheres.

AB: The value of sentinel node (SN) biopsy for squamous cell carcinoma of the
  head and neck (HNSCC) has not been determined yet. A critical evaluation of
  this concept seems to be mandatory with regard to the increasing acceptance of
  SN biopsy in other tumor entities. Against the background of the results of 48
  previously untreated patients, a reproducible technique for SN biopsy in the
  head and neck level, which has been adjusted to the special topographic
  conditions of this anatomic region, is presented. Methods included
  intraoperative SN biopsy, which was performed in 48 previously untreated
  patients suffering from squamous cell carcinoma (2X lower lip, 8X oral cavity,
  20X oropharynx, 15X larynx, 3X hypopharynx). Using ultrasound imaging, 43
  patients were staged as N0 necks, and 5 patients were staged as N1 necks. Fine
  -needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was performed in cases of doubt. Surgery on
  the neck was carried out according to the suspected stage of lymphogenic spread
  once the SN1 as well as one or two further hot nodes (SN2, SN3) had been
  identified. Numbers and distribution of the intraoperatively excised nodes SN1
  -3 were documented according to their relation to the tumor location. Post
  -operatively, the histologic results of the intraoperatively excised nodes SN1
  -3 were compared to the histologies of the neck dissection specimen. Results
  showed that in all 48 patients, a SN1 could be identified intraoperatively. In
  20 cases an additional SN2 and in 6 cases a SN3 was diagnosed. In carcinomas of
  the lower lip and oral cavity, the SN1 was found in 4 cases in level I (2X
  lower lip, 2X floor of the mouth) and in 6 cases in level II (6X lateral
  tongue). In carcinomas of the oropharynx, the respective nodes were found in 17
  of 20 cases in level II (carcinomas of the tonsil) and in 3 cases in level III
  (carcinomas of the base of the tongue). In supraglottic carcinomas the SN1 was
  identified in 8 of 10 cases in level II and in 2/5 patients with glottic
  carcinomas, while in 3/5 glottic carcinomas as well as in all hypopharyngeal
  carcinomas, the SN1 was found in level III. In relation to the predictiveness
  of the detected SN, it has to be remarked that in 38 patients a SN1 free of
  tumor was representative for the regional lymph node status (pN0). An isolated
  metastasis (pN1) was diagnosed in the SN (9XSN1, 1XSN2) in 10 patients. In
  conclusion, the results of a SN biopsy modified to a strictly intraoperative
  method of detection are encouraging. Critical indications showed that a
  thorough and standardized technical performance of the injection as well as a
  mandatory, so far unchanged, neck dissection form the basis for the development
  of a SN concept for SCCs of the upper aerodigestive tract. The value of the SN
  concept, however, currently remains unclear for patients suffering from HNSCC.

AB: Acute GVHD is more severe in aged BMT recipients but the mechanisms of this
  association are poorly understood. Using a well characterized murine GVHD model
  (B6 (H-2b)fwdarwB6D2F1 (H-2b/d)), we demonstrated an increase in acute GVHD
  severity and mortality in aged (18-20 months) vs young mice (2-4 months), 30
  day survival: 0% vs 50%, p<.001. GVHD was also increased in aged B6SF1
  recipients of SJL donor BMT ruling out strain combination artifact. Scores of
  GI tract histopathology were also significantly worse in aged recipients (17.5+
  -1.2 vs 7.5+-1.8, p<.03). Aged BMT recipients exhibited significant increases
  in LPS and TNF-alpha in the systemic circulation. Donor T cell proliferation,
  expansion and cytokine production to host antigens were all significantly
  greater in the spleens of aged recipients on day 7 after BMT. Intracellular
  staining of donor T cells showed also a threefold increase of IFN-gamma+ donor
  T cells in aged recipients (p<.002). In non irradiated B6D2F1 mice, both total
  and CD4+ T cell expansion were significantly increased (p<.03). In vitro, B6
  responder cells proliferated more and produced greater amounts of IL-2 and IFN
  -gamma to antigen presenting cells from aged naive B6D2F1 mice than from young
  mice. All sentinel aged B6D2F1 mice tested negative for the complete panel of
  infectious pathogens ruling out increased viral burden as the cause for
  increased allostimulation by aged APCs. We further investigated the increased
  allostimulatory capacity of aged APCs by FACS analysis of both splenocytes and
  BM-derived dendritic cells in young and aged mice. CD80, CD86 and CD40 were not
  consistently increased on APCs whereas MHC class II expression was consistently
  and significantly increased in aged mice. The use of negatively selected CD4+
  or CD8+ donor T cells in the same GVHD strain combination showed greater
  mortality in aged vs young recipients with CD4+ (90% vs 40%, p<.001) but not
  CD8+ cells. To evaluate further the role of age on APCs in GVHD we created
  B6D2F1 BM chimeras using syngeneic BM from old (o) donors (aged 18 mo) or young
  (y) donors (aged 2 mo) following 11 Gy TBI to recipients. Three months later we
  performed allogeneic BMT using B6 donors. In mice with aged marrow-derived APCs
  at week five GVHD mortality and clinical GVHD score were significantly higher.
  Donor T cell expansion at day 3 was increased threefold. We conclude that acute
  GVHD increases with recipient age in this model due to increased MHC II
  alloantigen expression on host APCs which causes increased donor T cell
  activation.

AB: Objective: By performing sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy, its detecting and
  predictive value to the cervical metastasis in the head and neck cancer
  patients was studied. Methods: Intraoperative SLN biopsy was done in 51
  untreated head and neck cancer patients who all had no metastasis before
  operation. The lesions were: laryngeal cancer 23, pharyngeal cancer 6, thyroid
  cancer 20 and cancer of the tongue 2. Fifteen minutes before taking the SLN,
  local 0.2 to 0.5 ml 2% isosulfan blue dye was submucously injected 0.5 cm away
  from the upper, lower, right and left margin of the primary tumor. The frozen
  sections of SLN were compared with the routine pathological sections of the
  cervical lymph nodes. The metastatic relation between the SLN and the cervical
  nodes as well as SLN's predictive value to the cervical nodes metastasis were
  analyzed. Results: SLN was successfully revealed in 48 (94%) of these 51
  patients, averaging 2.5 nodes per patient. They were: laryngeal cancer 22,
  pharyngeal cancer 6, thyroid cancer 18 and lingual cancer 1. Eleven of these
  SLNs were positive, among whom two had lymph node metastasis in addition to the
  SLN. Two others were false negative. The positive predictive value of SLNs to
  the cervical lymph node metastasis was 85%. Conclusion: The predictive value of
  sentinel lymph node to the cervical metastasis is important in head and neck
  cancer patients.

AB: Although the effects of heavy metals on marine invertebrate species are well
  studied in term of their toxicity and bioaccumulation, less is known about
  their genotoxicity. The aim of this investigation was to assess the DNA
  damaging potential of cadmium (Cd) in an important pollution sentinel organism,
  the mussel Mytilus edulis. Cadmium is one of the most toxic and widespread
  heavy metals found in the marine environment, and is a recognised carcinogen in
  mammals. Based on the results of the comet assay (alkaline single cell gel
  electrophoresis), Cd was found not to be genotoxic in mussel gill cells under
  acute and chronic exposure conditions, whereas pre-exposure to low
  concentrations of Cd was found to enhance the genotoxicity of another mutagen,
  hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The effects of H2O2 were normally reversible when
  cells were transferred to clean saline buffer. However, in cells that had been
  pre-treated with Cd, in vivo or in vitro, we observed a decrease in this post
  -treatment DNA repair. The effects of Cd were reversed by zinc which suggests
  that the inhibitory effect of Cd on DNA repair was due to the displacement of
  zinc ions from active sites on proteins involved in the repair process (a
  property already described for mammals). Moreover, since Cd inhibits or delays
  the onset of apoptosis (programmed cell death), this removes one of the main
  defence mechanisms responsible for protecting the organism against neoplasia.
  There appears to be a close similarity between the effects of Cd on marine
  molluscs and mammals.

AB: Our earlier studies demonstrating avian pneumovirus (APV) RNA in wild geese,
  sparrows, swallows, starlings and mallard ducks suggested that wild birds might
  be involved in the circulation of APV in the United States. To determine
  whether turkey virus can be transmitted to the free flying birds, we placed APV
  -negative mallard ducks next to a turkey farm experiencing a severe APV
  outbreak and in an area with a large population of waterfowls. The sentinel
  ducks did not develop clinical APV disease but infectious APV (APV/MN-12) was
  recovered from choanal swabs after 2 weeks, and anti-APV antibodies detected
  after 4 weeks. Four APV isolates recovered from the neighboring turkeys that
  were experiencing an APV outbreak at the same time shared 95-99% nucleotide
  identity and 97-99% predicted amino acid identity with the duck isolate. In
  addition experimental infection of turkey poults with APV/MN-12 resulted in
  detection of viral RNA in nasal turbinates and APV-specific IgG in serum. These
  results indicate that the APV isolates from turkeys and ducks shared a common
  source, and the viruses from different avian species can cross-infect.

AB: The viruses were isolated from the blood of sentinel cattle and Culicoides
  biting midges in the Kyushu district, southwestern Japan, in 1999 and
  identified by neutralization tests as Peaton (PEA) viruses. Before this study,
  PEA virus had been isolated in Australia only. The nucleotide identity of the
  nucleocapsid (N) protein encoded by the S segment ranged from 91.1 to 91.6%
  between the Australian and Japanese strains. A phylogenetic analysis of the N
  protein sequence revealed that the PEA virus strains are closely related to
  Aino (AIN) virus and suggested reassortment events for PEA and AIN viruses.

AB: Cancerbioassays have demonstrated the carcinogenic activity of vinyl acetate
  in rodents. Tumors appear only at the site of contact and mechanistic data
  suggest that the carcinogenic mechanism involves carboxylesterase-mediated
  metabolism of vinyl acetate to acetic acid. It has been hypothesized that
  intracellular formation of acetate causes a reduction of intracellular pH (pHi)
  at noncytotoxic levels, but that prolonged exposure to reduced pHi is cytotoxic
  and/or mitogenic and drives proliferative responses. Coupled with exposure to
  metabolically formed acetaldehyde at high administered concentrations,
  nonlinear dose-response curves for epithelial tumors are produced. Freshly
  isolated rat hepatocytes were used as a model system to test the concept that
  exposure of cells to vinyl acetate causes a reduction in pHi. Quantitative
  fluorescence imaging ratio microscopy showed that exposure of hepatocytes to
  vinyl acetate concentrations ranging from 10 to 1000 muM caused rapid and
  sustained reductions of approximately 0.03 to 0.65 pH units. Cellular
  acidification was rapidly reversed to control pHi upon removal of vinyl
  acetate. There was minimal accumulation of protons during the exposure period,
  as suggested by minor differences in pHi of cells with or without prior
  exposure to vinyl acetate. The effect of vinyl acetate on pHi was attenuated by
  prior exposure to the carboxylesterase inhibitor bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate.
  These results support the concept that intracellular acidification is a
  sentinel pharmacodynamic response of cells to vinyl acetate exposure and that
  pHi is an appropriate metric dose for use in quantitative risk assessments of
  cancer and noncancer human health risk assessment.

AB: Objective. The aim of the study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy and
  feasibility of sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection using a gamma probe in
  patients suffering from vulvar cancer. Methods. From May 1998 to November 2000,
  26 patients with early vulvar cancer, planned for local wide excision or
  vulvectomy including groin dissection, were eligible for the study. Two to 3 h
  before the planned procedure we injected technetium99 m-labeled microcolloid
  intradermally at four locations around the tumor. Dynamic and static images
  were recorded using a gamma camera. SLN locations were marked on the overlying
  skin. In the operating theater SLNs were identified at the beginning of the
  procedure using a handheld gamma-detection probe. After resection of suspected
  SLNs a standard unilateral or bilateral groin dissection was performed,
  subsequently followed by local wide excision or, if indicated, radical
  vulvectomy. Sentinel node detection using technetium99 m-labeled microcolloid
  was compared with final histopathological and immunohistochemical results.
  Results. Scintigraphy showed focal uptake in all 26 patients. Intraoperatively
  we detected all sentinel nodes by handheld gamma probe. In 20 patients, one
  sentinel node was identified unilaterally, while in 6 patients two or more
  nodes were identified bilaterally. Histologically positive SLNs were found in 9
  patients. In our preliminary series we did not find any false-negative SLN.
  Conclusion. Identification of sentinel nodes in vulvar cancer is feasible with
  preoperatively administered technetium99m-labeled microcolloid. We confirm the
  results of previous studies and improve the evidence that the SLN procedure
  could be implemented in future therapy concepts.

AB: From 1997-1998, we investigated the possible continuous circulation of
  epizootic Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus suggested by a 1983
  subtype IC interepizootic mosquito isolate made in Panaquire, Miranda State,
  Venezuela. The study area was originally covered by lowland tropical rainforest
  but has been converted into cacao plantations. Sentinel hamsters, small mammal
  trapping, mosquito collections, and human serosurveys were used to detect
  active or recent virus circulation. Six strains of subtype ID VEE virus were
  isolated from hamsters that displayed no apparent disease. Four other
  arboviruses belonging to group A (Togaviridae: Alphavirus), two Bunyamwera
  group (Bunyaviridae), and three Gamboa group (Bunyaviridae) arboviruses were
  also isolated from hamsters, as well as 8 unidentified viruses. Venezuelan
  equine encephalitis-specific antibodies were detected in 5 small mammal
  species: Proechimys guairae, Marmosa spp., and Didelphis marsupialis. Mosquito
  collections comprised of 38 different species, including 8 members of the
  subgenus Culex (Melanoconion), did not yield any virus isolates. Sera from 195
  humans, either workers in the cacao plantation or nearby residents, were all
  negative for VEE virus antibodies. Sequences of 1,677 nucleotides from the P62
  gene of 2 virus isolates indicated that they represent a subtype ID lineage
  that is distinct from all others characterized previously, and are unrelated to
  epizootic VEE emergence.

  sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in 12 patients with a squamous cell carcinoma of
  the oral cavity or oropharynx. Dynamic lymphoscintigraphy and a hand-held gamma
  probe were used to depict the SLNs to be aspirated. Cytologic examination of
  the aspirated SLNs revealed neck lymph node status in patients who underwent
  neck dissection (n=6). In patients who underwent only transoral excision, one
  false-negative cytologic result was observed. This combined approach is
  expected to improve the detection of occult neck lymph node metastases.

AB: Malaria continues to have a high morbidity rate associated among European
  travelers. Thorough recording of epidemiological and clinical aspects of
  imported malaria has been helpful in the detection of new outbreaks and areas
  of developing drug resistance. Sentinel surveillance of data collected
  prospectively since 1999 has begun within TropNetEurop, a European network
  focusing on imported infectious diseases. TropNetEurop appears to cover
  apprx10% of all patients with malaria seen in Europe. Reports of 1659
  immigrants and European patients with Plasmodium falciparum malaria were
  analyzed for epidemiological information and data on clinical features.
  Regional data were quite diverse, reflecting local patterns of immigration and
  international travel. By far, the most infections were imported from West
  Africa. Europeans had more clinical complications; consequently, all deaths
  occurred in this group. Compared with European standards, the mortality rate
  was low (0.6% in Europeans). Data from TropNetEurop member sites can contribute
  to our understanding of the epidemiological and clinical findings regarding
  imported falciparum malaria.

AB: The aim of this study was to begin evaluating the utility of sand crabs
  (Emerita analoga) as an indicator species for the algal neurotoxin, domoic acid
  (DA), in Monterey Bay, California, USA, a site of recurrent blooms of the DA
  -producing diatom, Pseudo-nitzschia. One of the current sentinel organisms, the
  sea mussel (Mytilus californianus), has shown minimal or undetectable toxicity
  during some local bloom events. As a critical step in assuring the accuracy of
  DA determinations in E. analoga, we have developed and validated a highly
  efficient extraction protocol that yields toxin recoveries of 97+-2.9%. We also
  determined by HPLC-UV and receptor binding assay, with confirmation by LC
  -MS/MS, that sand crabs accumulated measurable amounts of DA during toxic
  Pseudo-nitzschia blooms, while the sea mussel showed no detectable toxin. In
  addition, a comparison of inter-animal variability in DA content revealed
  values ranging from ca. 0.5 to 5 mug DA g-1 tissue and no consistent trend with
  size class, based on either animal weight or length. These data on the toxicity
  of individual animals will be useful in designing an appropriate sampling
  strategy for monitoring DA and, importantly, indicate that sand crabs do not
  appear to progressively bioaccumulate DA with age.

AB: A survey was conducted of the antimicrobial susceptibilities of 595
  Acinetobacter spp. isolated from routine clinical specimens in 54 sentinel
  laboratories throughout the UK during 2000. Isolates of the Acinetobacter
  baumannii complex (genomic groups 2, 3 and 13TU; n=443) were distinguished from
  other genomic groups (n=152) by PCR fingerprinting of tDNA spacer regions. MICs
  of amikacin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, colistin, gentamicin,
  imipenem, meropenem, minocycline, piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam,
  rifampicin, sulbactam and tetracycline were determined on lsoSensitest agar and
  interpreted, wherever possible, using BSAC breakpoints. Tigecycline (GAR-936),
  a new glycylcycline, was also tested. Resistance to cephalosporins,
  aminoglycosides and ciprofloxacin was widespread, but carbapenems, colistin,
  sulbactam, minocycline and tigecycline were each active against >80% of the
  isolates. Isolates of A. baumannii were more often resistant to cefotaxime,
  ceftazidime, piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin
  and tetracyclines than those belonging to other genomic groups, but were less
  often resistant to colistin; no significant differences between genomic groups
  were noted in the susceptibilities to amikacin, carbapenems, rifampicin or
  sulbactam. The relative activities of the tetracyclines were
  minocycline>tigecycline>tetracycline. Thirteen carbapenem-resistant isolates
  (MICsgtoreq8 mg/L; 2.2%) were received from six centres; four centres sent
  single isolates; one sent three and one sent six. An allele of blaIMP was
  detected in one of these isolates, but the other 12 isolates either had
  carbapenemase-independent resistance, or undetectable carbapenemase activity
  combined with other resistance mechanisms. In conclusion, carbapenems, colistin
  and minocycline retained greatest activity against the Acinetobacter isolates
  collected. Tigecycline was less active than minocycline, but both agents
  overcame most tetracycline resistance.

AB: The status of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) has been shown to accurately
  reflect the presence or absence of metastases in the axilla in patients with
  breast cancer. This study was designed to determine the optimal protocol for
  SLN processing. A total of 173 SLNs from 96 breast cancer patients who had
  successful SLN localization and underwent completion axillary node dissection
  were identified. All SLNs were negative for metastases by initial routine
  histologic evaluation. The nodes were submitted in a total of 300 blocks. Each
  block was serially sectioned to produce 10 levels. Pan-cytokeratin stain was
  performed on levels 3 and 8. All other levels were stained with hematoxylin and
  eosin. Metastases were identified in 22 SLNs from 19 patients by examining all
  10 levels. The first two hematoxylin and eosin- or the first cytokeratin
  -stained levels were positive for metastases in 21 (95.5%) of the 22 positive
  SLNs. Two additional hematoxylin and eosin-stained and one cytokeratin-stained
  levels of each SLN correctly identified the status of the node in 94 (97.9%) of
  96 patients. Therefore, we recommend that after an initial hematoxylin and
  eosin-stained section, two additional hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections
  and one cytokeratin-stained section should be evaluated.

AB: Background: Management of the N0 neck in patients with head and
  neckisquamous cell carcinoma (SCC) remains controversial. We describe the
  outcome of patients who underwent transoral tumor excision and a wait-and-see
  policy for the neck staged N0 by ultrasonography-guided cytology (USgF-NAC).
  Because selection of lymph nodes for USgFNAC is currently based on size
  criteria, we investigated the additional value of sentinel node (SN)
  identification. Methods: The outcome of 161 patients with T1-T2
  oral/oropharyngeal SCC was determined. In a subgroup of 39 patients the SN was
  identified and aspirated in addition. Results: SN identification and aspiration
  was possible in 38 of 39 patients but without decreasing the false-negative
  rate of USgFNAC. During follow-up (12-99 months) 34 of 161 (21%) patients
  developed lymph node metastases. After therapeutic neck dissection and
  postoperative radiotherapy, 27 of 34 (79%) could be salvaged (88% regional
  control). Conclusions: Wait-and-see seems justified in case of negative
  USgFNAC. Strict follow-up with USgFNAC is required. SN identification and
  aspiration is feasible but did not improve lymph node selection.

AB: The main target of any foodborne disease surveillance is to identify
  outbreaks of foodborne diseases. The existing reporting system has still some
  gaps. In co-operation with selected physicians a sentinel surveillance system,
  called SENSO, was established in the Canton of Solothurn. The aim was to
  identify foodborne disease outbreaks and their possible sources. From April 1,
  1998 to March 31, 2001 18 general practitioners as well as six hospitals
  reported 77 notifications. Of these, 18 were further investigated and resulted
  in 226 patients, 120 hospitalisation-days and 621 lost working days. The
  continuation of the SENSO system was welcomed by 11 out of 15 (73%) physicians.
  However, to shorten the reporting time, an electronic version should be
  carefully evaluated.

AB: Background: West Nile surveillance was set up in the province of Ontario to
  provide an early warning of the appearance of the disease during the summer and
  fall of 2000. Methods: Data was collected from five sentinel systems from June
  to October 31, 2000. These included sentinel chickens, mosquitoes, dead birds
  and animals, and human surveillance. Chickens were tested weekly for the
  presence of West Nile antibody. Mosquitoes collected in CDC light traps were
  enumerated, speciated pooled and frozen. Dead birds and appropriate animals
  were examined for West Nile antigen by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. A
  network of 58 hospitals across southern Ontario reported on and provided serum
  for antibody testing (by haemagglutination inhibition) on patients hospitalized
  with fever and encephalopathy+-muscle weakness. Physicians across the province
  were encouraged to report on and submit sera from patients fitting the case
  definition. Data on all lab requests for West Nile antibody testing was also
  collected. Results: All 180 sentinel chickens remained seronegative for West
  Nile throughout the season. The predominant species of mosquito collected was
  Aedes, with Culex pipiens making up approximately 20-40%. Of 1531 dead birds
  submitted for examination, 1255 (82%) were autopsied. None were positive for
  West Nile with the exception of one crow from the Windsor area with equivocal
  PCR results. No animals were positive for West Nile in Ontario. Of 188 patients
  identified through active and enhanced passive human surveillance, 61 met the
  case definition. 41% (25) of these had acute and convalescent sera submitted
  for West Nile antibody testing. No cases of West Nile infection were
  identified, however 8 patients had sero-conversions to other arboviruses,
  including Dengue and Powassan. Conclusions: Although numerous positive birds,
  mosquito pools and animals were identified in the states bordering southern
  Ontario, no West Nile activity could be demonstrated in the province during the
  2000 season.

AB: The Minnesota Department of Health conducts ongoing sentinel surveillance
  for enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) on approximately 4,000 enteric cultures
  annually from patients with diarrheal illness. Cultures are screened for ETEC
  using a duplex PCR assay and traditional gel analysis (D-PCR) for the E. coli
  heat-labile (LT) and heat-stable (ST) enterotoxins. Positives are confirmed by
  retesting with single primer pairs. To decrease turn-around time and labor
  cost, and to address concerns about false-positive gel results and sensitivity
  of ST detection, a real-time SYBR green PCR assay was developed. Three primer
  sets were designed for multiplex amplification of the LT gene (eltB) and the ST
  alleles STa1 (estA1) and STa2-STa3 (estA2 and estA3). Assays were performed on
  an Applied Biosystems GeneAmp 5700 using a SYBR green detection system. As with
  D-PCR, positives were confirmed by retesting with single primer sets. Results
  on control isolates showed that LT and ST products could be differentiated in a
  multiplex reaction on the basis of the melting temperature. A prospective
  comparison of the two methods was conducted on 328 stool cultures. Six samples
  were found to be positive by both D-PCR and SYBR green assays. Four additional
  samples were positive by SYBR green, negative by D-PCR and confirmed as
  positive by single primer sets. Fifty samples which were positive by D-PCR and
  negative in the SYBR green assay failed to amplify with the single primer sets
  using either method and were considered to be false-positives. Two hundred
  sixty-eight samples were negative by both methods. These results indicate that
  the SYBR green multiplex PCR assay for detection of ETEC is more sensitive than
  the traditional duplex PCR method. Elimination of the need for gel
  electrophoresis and the reduction in the number of false-positives resulted in
  a shorter turnaround time for the SYBR green screening method.

AB: Background: Regional lymph node status is an important predictor of survival
  in patients with malignant melanoma. Mapping of sentinel lymph nodes using
  sensitive molecular techniques has recently been introduced. Malignant melanoma
  is heterogeneous in terms of its biological, immunological and metastatic
  properties, and melanoma cells exhibit a polymorphous expression of tumour
  markers. Thus, assays that include multiple markers appear to be more sensitive
  than single-marker assays. Objectives: To characterize the molecular profiles
  of melanoma cells in sentinel lymph nodes employing the mRNA expression of
  tyrosinase, MIA and MART-1 as markers. Methods: Samples of sentinel lymph nodes
  from 17 melanoma patients and 18 control nodes from non-melanoma patients were
  assayed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, using specific
  primers for each marker. Results: We found that both tyrosinase and MIA
  expression were sensitive indicators of micrometastases in sentinel lymph nodes
  that were negative on routine histopathological examination, and that the
  finding of micrometastases expressing MART-1 in sentinel lymph nodes was
  negatively correlated with overall survival. Conclusions: Characterization of
  the molecular profiles of melanoma cells constitutes a valid means of detecting
  metastatic melanoma cells in sentinel lymph nodes, and of predicting the
  survival of melanoma patients.

  management of breast cancer. Breast conserving therapy (BCT) utilizing
  segmental mastectomy has been developed as an alternative to total mastectomy
  to improve cosmetic and psychosocial outcomes while retaining oncologic
  benefits. Developments in the surgical treatment of breast cancer have changed
  the way breast cancer is diagnosed and treated, and will likely continue to
  evolve in the future. This review highlights aspects of breast cancer treatment
  in which the surgical approach has evolved or is evolving, and comments on how
  the surgeon may participate in breast cancer care in the future.

AB: Guinea pig (GP) sera seropositive to human parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV
  -3) antigen were found previously in our laboratory. In the present study, we
  attempted to isolate and characterize a new agent from GP colonies. The new
  agent was isolated from lung homogenate of sentinel GPs, which were maintained
  in the GP room containing the serologically positive GP breeding colony. This
  new agent was found to be comparable to human and bovine PIV-3 strains in
  regard to its moderate cytopathic effects, hemagglutinating activity, and
  neutralizing activity, and moreover, it was found to produce antigens cross
  -reactive to both of the latter PIV-3s. The resemblance between the new
  isolates and the other PIV-3s was supported by the SDS-PAGE and Western blot
  analysis of the viral proteins. This is the first report of the isolation of a
  type 3-like parainfluenza virus from GP. This finding is significant, insofar
  as an inapparent infection with the virus may concern animal experimentation in
  the use of GP.

AB: Bucephaloides gracilescens is a common parasite in the intestine of the
  angler fish Lophius piscatorius, and the metacercariae have been recorded from
  a number of gadoid intermediate hosts. In a toxicokinetic study of lindane
  (gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane) in bullrout Myoxocephalus scorpius, metacercariae
  of B. gracilescens were found in the central nervous system (CNS). Furthermore,
  the metacercariae accumulated concentrations of lindane that were higher than
  in the surrounding CNS tissue. This is the first report of metacercariae of B.
  gracilescens in bullrout. In addition the present results contribute knowledge
  of the disposition of an important environmental contaminant in the
  metacercarial stage of a trematode that has been pointed out as a promising
  sentinel species of pollution in the marine environment.

AB: Objectives: First, to compare the prevalence of HIV infection among women in
  the general population and antenatal clinic (ANC) attenders in rural Mwanza,
  Tanzania, and second, to validate a method for adjusting HIV prevalence in ANC
  attenders to estimate the prevalence in the general female population aged 15
  -44 years. Methods: A cross-sectional population survey was conducted in 12
  rural communities of Mwanza Region between 1991 and 1992. From the same
  communities sequential ANC attenders were recruited on two occasions between
  1991 and 1993. Consenting subjects were interviewed, examined, treated and a
  serum sample was tested for HIV. The HIV prevalence in women in the general
  population was compared with unadjusted and adjusted prevalences in ANC
  attenders. Parity-adjusted prevalences were obtained by applying correction
  factors to the observed prevalences in parous and nulliparous ANC attenders.
  Results: A total of 5675 women aged 15-44 years from the general population and
  2265 ANC attenders had complete socio-demographic and laboratory data.
  Unadjusted HIV prevalence was significantly lower in ANC attenders (3.6%) than
  women from the general population (4.7%, P=0.025), but after adjustment there
  was no significant difference between the two groups (4.6 versus 4.7%, P=0.95).
  Conclusion: In this rural population, the HIV prevalence in ANC attenders
  underestimated the prevalence among women in the general population, but this
  difference was eliminated by applying parity-based correction factors.
  Information on parity should be routinely collected in ANC-based HIV sentinel
  surveillance.

AB: Ixodes spinipalpis maintains Borrelia bissettii spirochetes in Colorado in a
  cycle involving wood rats and deer mice. This tick has been described as
  nidicolous, remaining either attached to its rodent hosts or in the rodent
  nest. Nidicolous ticks pose little risk of pathogen transmission to humans if
  they do not actively quest for hosts. To investigate the questing potential of
  I. spinipalpis, sentinel mice were placed in an area where I. spinipalpis had
  been commonly found on wood rats and deer mice. Concurrently, wild rodent
  populations were trapped and analyzed for Lyme disease spirochetes, the agent
  of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (aoHGE), and Babesia microti. A total of 122
  I. spinipalpis larvae and 10 nymphs were found on 19% of 244 sentinel mice. In
  addition, 4 sentinel mice became infested with Malaraeus telchinus or Orchopeas
  neotomae fleas. Questing I. spinipalpis were positively associated with woody
  shrubs and negatively associated with sunny and grassy areas. Four sentinel
  mice became infected with aoHGE after having been fed upon only by I.
  spinipalpis larvae. One sentinel mouse became infected with B. bissettii after
  having an I. spinipalpis nymph feed on it, and one sentinel mouse became
  coinfected with aoHGE and B. bissettii after it was fed upon by a single I.
  spinipalpis nymph. These sentinel mouse conversions suggest the possibility
  that the aoHGE is transovarially transmitted by I. spinipalpis, and that I.
  spinipalpis is capable of simultaneously transmitting B. bissettii and the
  aoHGE. The findings that I. spinipalpis quest away from rodent nests and will
  attach to and infect sentinel mice may be of public health importance. It
  suggests the potential transmission of the agents of human granulocytic
  ehrlichiosis and Lyme disease to other hosts by I. spinipalpis, in regions of
  the western United States where Ixodes pacificus is not found.

AB: In mid-January 2000, the reappearance of Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus
  activity in the Australasian region was first demonstrated by the isolation of
  JE virus from 3 sentinel pigs on Badu Island in the Torres Strait. Further
  evidence of JE virus activity was revealed through the isolation of JE virus
  from Culex gelidus mosquitoes collected on Badu Island and the detection of
  specific JE virus neutralizing antibodies in 3 pigs from Saint Pauls community
  on Moa Island. Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of the
  premembrane and envelope genes were performed which showed that both the pig
  and mosquito JE virus isolates (TS00 and TS4152, respectively) clustered in
  genotype I, along with northern Thai, Cambodian, and Korean isolates. All
  previous Australasian JE virus isolates belong to genotype II, along with
  Malaysian and Indonesian isolates. Therefore, for the first time, the
  appearance and transmission of a second genotype of JE virus in the
  Australasian region has been demonstrated.

AB: This study compared the use of sentinel species-and community-based field
  approaches for assessing the biological status of fish living in a river
  receiving pulp and paper mill effluents. Three approaches were compared. Two
  approaches used sentinel species. One of these involved an internal/external
  examination of the fish that leads to the calculation of a fish health
  assessment index (HAI) and the other involved biochemical measurements of
  hepatic mixed function oxidase (MFO) activity and plasma steroid levels. The
  third approach characterized the fish community structure according to an index
  of biotic integrity (IBI). The comparison focused on how the methods respond to
  the hypothesis that recent process modifications/effluent treatment changes,
  resulting in demonstrable improvements in effluent quality, have beneficial
  effects on fish. Neither of the approaches using sentinel fish indicated clear
  mill-related influences either before or after the process
  modifications/effluent treatment changes. There was no evidence of depressed
  plasma steroids and increased MFO activity in fish frequently associated with
  mill effluent exposure in previous studies. While the HAI was higher at
  stations downstream from two mills, this could not be linked to effluent
  exposure alone. In contrast, the study of community structure showed a
  substantial improvement in fish assemblages at all the mill sites.

AB: Background: Stereotactic incisional core breast biopsy (SCBB) is a highly
  specific technique for diagnosing ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in patients
  with suspicious mammographic microcalcifications. However, its sensitivity for
  excluding the presence of coexisting occult invasive disease in this setting is
  not fully established. Design: We correlated SCBB findings to subsequent
  lumpectomy/mastectomy (lx/mx) results in 122 cases of DCIS. In 29 of these
  cases, the SCBB showed microscopic invasion (n = 15) or foci that were
  suspicious for invasion (n = 14). Likelihood for invasive disease in subsequent
  lx/mx samples from each case then was compared with various parameters,
  including DCIS grade, extent and mammographic findings. Results: Overall, 13%
  of cases in which the SCBB showed DCIS only (i.e., without any evidence of
  invasion), had invasive disease in the subsequent excision. This finding was
  significantly correlated with DCIS grade (low: 0/26 (0%), intermediate: 2/31
  (6%), high: 10/36 (28%), P < .001). Invasive lesions were usually small (nine
  T1a, one T1b, and two T1c) and typically present within more extensive fields
  of DCIS (no invasion: 1.5 cm DCIS size; invasion: 2.8 cm mean DCIS size, P =
  .01). This was reflected by greater extent of involvement in the SCBB (5/8
  cases with invasion had > 15 ducts involved, versus 4/23 with < 15 ducts
  involved, P = .03). SCBB that were suspicious or positive for microinvasion
  demonstrated invasion in most subsequent excision (susp: 7/14 (50%), microinv:
  11/15 (73%)), generally of significant extent (11/18 T1b-c). Conclusions: 1.
  Patients with SCBB showing high grade DCIS and DCIS suspicious or positive for
  microinvasion have a significant and high likelihood, respectively, of
  harboring occult invasive neoplasm. They should accordingly be carefully
  evaluated radiographically, and possibly with sentinel node biopsy to
  facilitate axillary staging. 2. Likelihood of occult invasion is correlated
  with overall DCIS size/extent.

AB: The response regulator SpoOA is the master control element in the initiation
  of sporulation in Bacillus subtilis. Like many other multi-domain response
  regulators, the latent activity of the effector, C-terminal domain is
  stimulated by phosphorylation on a conserved aspartic acid residue in the
  regulatory, N-terminal domain. If a threshold concentration of phosphorylated
  SpoOA is achieved, the transcription of genes required for sporulation is
  activated, whereas the genes encoding stationary phase sentinels are repressed,
  and sporulation proceeds. Despite detailed genetic, biochemical and structural
  characterisation, it is not understood how the phosphorylation signal in the
  receiver domain is transduced into DNA binding and transcription activation in
  the distal effector domain. An obstacle to our understanding of SpoOA function
  is the uncertainty concerning changes in quaternary structure that accompany
  phosphorylation. Here we have revisited this question and shown unequivocally
  that SpoOA forms dimers upon phosphorylation and that the subunit interactions
  in the dimer are mediated principally by the receiver domain. Purified dimers
  of two mutants of SpoOA, in which the phosphorylatable aspartic acid residue
  has been substituted, activate transcription from the spoIIG promoter in vitro,
  whereas monomers do not. This suggests that dimers represent the activated form
  of SpoOA.

AB: As part of the amended Metal Mining Liquid Effluent Regulations under the
  Fisheries Act, mines will be required to develop and conduct Environmental
  Effects Monitoring (EEM). EEM will be done to evaluate the effects of mine
  effluent on fish, fish habitat, and fish usability. Mines will be required to
  determine if there are changes in fish populations and/or in the usability of
  fish due to mine effluent. The EEM program has been designed with a tiered
  monitoring approach, with the first phase determining if an effect is present.
  Subsequent phases of EEM will focus on continued monitoring and determining the
  magnitude, geographic extent, and cause of effects (if any). Fish collected
  from the area exposed to mine effluent will be compared to fish from a
  reference area in order to determine if there is an effect, if the effect is
  mine related and the cause of the effect within the effluent. The fish
  population survey will examine the growth, reproduction, condition, and
  survival of one or more resident sentinel fish species. Fish usability will be
  determined based on the appearance of fish, their use, and the contaminant
  levels in fish tissue. It is recognized that some mines may not be able to
  implement a fish monitoring program as outlined, so it has been recommended
  that alternative methods, such as caged bivalves or on-site bioassays, may also
  be used. Frequency of monitoring will be dependent on the previous results of
  the fish and benthic invertebrate monitoring phases.

AB: Under the Canadian Fisheries Act, pulp and paper mills and metal mines must
  conduct a cyclical monitoring program for potential environmental effects that
  includes a fish survey. Study designs for the fish survey have been evolving
  over the past few years, and there has been increased emphasis on the use of
  small-bodied fish species. Increasing concerns about the potential impacts of
  sampling programs on the fish populations in smaller receiving waters have led
  us to develop non-lethal sampling methodologies that will satisfy the
  information requirements for the environmental effects monitoring program. This
  manuscript outlines the use of a non-lethal sampling program to collect
  information on age distributions, growth rates, reproductive performance and
  fish condition in populations of slimy sculpin inhabiting forested and
  agricultural sections of a small New Brunswick river.

  single lung metastasis were resected. Thorough examinations did not show any
  evidence of a primary tumour. From the site of the metastasis on the right
  scapular region, lymphoscintigraphy with axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy
  was performed. One axillary lymph node could be identified intra-operatively
  with the gamma probe as sentinel node. The sentinel node and 4 adjacent lymph
  nodes clinically showed black pigmentation. However, histopathological
  examination of the lymph nodes did not detect micrometastases. The pigmentation
  of the lymph nodes was due to decorative tattoos of the scapular skin.

AB: Late-spawning Fraser River sockeye salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka, stocks have
  suffered significant prespawn mortality associated with an unusually early
  freshwater migration pattern and the myxosporean parasite Parvicapsula
  minibicornis. Surveys of migrating adult salmon from several spawning
  populations were conducted in 1999 and 2000 to determine the extent of
  infection with P. minibicornis, when and where the parasite first becomes
  detectable during migration, and whether early migrating stocks might be used
  as sentinels to assess risk of infection in late-spawning stocks. Posterior
  kidney, preserved in 95% ethanol, was examined for P. minibicornis in stained
  histological sections and using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. The
  prevalence of this parasite in all Fraser River sockeye salmon stocks examined
  was high (range 47-100% infected). In contrast, P. minibicornis was not
  detected in the fish tested from the two sockeye salmon stocks outside the
  Fraser River drainage in either 1999 or 2000. The parasite was also not
  detected histologically or by PCR in the kidney tissue of the fish from the
  Fraser River that were sampled in salt water or early during their freshwater
  migration up the river. These findings and the progression in the prevalence
  and intensity of infection as the fish from three stocks (early Stuart, Weaver
  Creek and Cultus Lake) were monitored over time, suggest salmon acquired the
  parasite either in the lower Strait of Georgia or in the lower Fraser River
  before the confluence of the Harrison River. In both 1999 and 2000 the parasite
  was present in all Fraser River sockeye salmon stocks sampled, which suggests
  that early Stuart salmon may be valuable as a sentinel stock for the presence
  of the parasite in later-spawning stocks.

AB: Objective: To describe symptoms, surgical diagnosis and treatment, and long
  -term outcome of patients with symptomatic diaphragmatic endometriosis. Design:
  Observational follow-up study. Setting: American tertiary referral center for
  the surgical treatment of endometriosis. Patient(s): Eight patients with
  diaphragmatic endometriosis causing severe or disabling symptoms.
  Intervention(s): Laparoscopic diagnosis of diaphragmatic endometriosis followed
  by upper abdominal laparotomy for full-thickness resection of the diaphragm.
  Main Outcome Measure(s): Reduction of several symptoms as measured on a 5-point
  ranked ordinal scale administered by a phone survey up to 7 years after
  surgery. Result(s): Laparoscopy from an umbilical port may identify small
  "sentinel lesions" of endometriosis on the anterior or mid diaphragm. Eight
  symptomatic patients all had significant invasive disease with dimensions up to
  5 cm across of the posterior right diaphragm, which could not always be seen
  from the umbilical port site. All such lesions can be seen by a laparoscope
  placed beneath the right costal margin. Laparoscopic treatment of symptomatic
  disease is not rational given the posterior placement of the disease out of
  sight behind the liver and the full-thickness nature of the disease in all
  eight patients. Laparotomy with full thickness resection of the diaphragm
  resulted in complete eradication of symptoms in seven of eight patients, and
  good symptomatic reduction in one. Conclusion(s): Treatment of diaphragmatic
  endometriosis by laparotomy results in a high rate of symptom relief.
  Laparoscopic treatment of diaphragmatic endometriosis will result in a high
  rate of incomplete diagnosis and incomplete treatment with a high rate of
  continuing symptoms.

AB: Background: Lymphatic mapping for sentinel node biopsy in breast cancer and
  melanoma usually involves initial peritumoral injection of a radioisotope,
  gamma camera detection of the sentinel lymph node several hours prior to the
  operation, and separate perioperative injection of a blue dye. We have
  developed a combined approach using technetium 99m labeled blue dye (Evans
  Blue) for use in lymphoscintigraphy that may be injected as a single dose just
  prior to the operation. Methods: In an anesthetized rabbit model we dissected a
  hind limb to display the popliteal node and afferent lymphatic. Technetium 99m
  Evans Blue (99mTc-EB) (22 MBq; 0.5 mL) was injected subdermally in the dorsum
  of the paw. Simultaneous digital and gamma camera images were obtained at 14
  time intervals to 30 minutes post injection. For each of these time intervals
  the percentage of radioactivity and percentage blueness of the popliteal node
  were determined. Urine and afferent lymphatic fluid were analyzed by
  chromatography. The popliteal node was excised post mortem, placed into solvent
  solutions and analyzed for blueness and radioactivity. Results: Time-activity
  curves for radioactivity and time-blueness curves for Evans Blue uptake showed
  strong correlation (r=0.958). Lymph analysis suggested 99mTc-EB is mainly bound
  to endogenous proteins. Urine was radioactive but not colored, 99mTc-EB being
  metabolized and excreted in the urine as 1,7-diamino-8-naphthol-2,4-disulfonic
  acid. Prolonged exposure of node to solvents did not dissociate any blue
  coloration or radioactivity. Conclusions: 99mTc-EB and Evans Blue are
  simultaneously retained and concentrated in the sentinel lymph node. This
  process is rapid and reproducible. 99mTc-EB migrates at the same rate as Evans
  Blue in lymph, where it is transported as bound to endogenous proteins. These
  dye molecules are metabolized by reductive cleavage in the liver and then
  excreted renally as colorless, radioactive metabolites. This novel agent has
  the potential to facilitate lymphatic mapping and subsequent sentinel node
  biopsy for a range of solid malignancies including breast cancer and melanoma.

AB: The bacterium Haemophilus influenzae exists as a pathogen and a commensal in
  the human population. The duality of its existence begs a better understanding
  of the mechanisms by which it switches between these two states. In an effort
  to find a genetic locus that made one strain particularly virulent, we
  discovered a complete prophage. While this prophage eventually proved to have
  no role in host virulence, it did offer a great deal of information in regards
  to the evolution and function of Haemophilus bacteriophages. This
  bacteriophage, HP2, is unique compared to its cousins in that it is restricted
  to a host far diverged from the classically described Haemophilus bacteriophage
  host, Rd. The complete genome of HP2 is presented in this work, as are studies
  on the mechanisms behind the barriers that restrict these bacteriophages to
  their particular hosts. While the HP2 prophage is not commonly found in
  Haemophilus isolates, those that are lysogenic for HP2 are usually serum
  resistant, invasive isolates, in the same fashion as the sentinel strain. The
  characterization of HP2 adds to the existing data on Haemophilus
  bacteriophages, making them one of the better-described families outside of the
  E. coli phages.

AB: We prospectively evaluated 31 patients with invasive breast cancer.
  Preoperative positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D
  -glucose (18F-FDG) for detection of axillary lymph node metastases was compared
  with the histopathologic status of the sentinel lymph node (SLN). Sensitivity
  of PET imaging was 43%, specificity and negative predictive value were 94 and
  67%, respectively. The smallest metastasis detected by PET measured 3 mm in
  diameter. The results of this study suggest that detection of small axillary
  lymph node metastases is limited by the currently achievable spatial resolution
  of PET imaging. Selective axillary surgery in breast cancer patients based on
  18F-FDG PET is yet not possible.

AB: Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility and
  contribution of two intraoperative procedures of lymphatic mapping and sentinel
  node detection using a blue dye in surgically-staged patients with early stage
  endometrial cancer. Methods and Materials: In 25 cases of endometrial cancer,
  patent blue-V was injected into the subserosal myometrium (13 cases, SM group)
  or cervico-subserosal myometrium (12 cases, CSM group) during a surgical
  staging procedure. Laparoscopically-assisted vaginal hysterectomy and pelvic
  lymphadenectomy were completed successfully in 23 women out of 24
  laparoscopically-staged patients (95.8%). One patient with FIGO stage IIa was
  indicated for a radical abdominal surgery. Results: A deposition of the blue
  dye-was found in at least one pelvic lymph node (LN) in eight out of 13 cases
  (61.5%) in the SM group compared with ten out of 12 cases (83.3%) in the CSM
  group (p = 0.378). The mean number of dye-colored LN (DCLN) was 1.15 (SM group)
  and 2.5 (CSM group), respectively (p = 0.05). The rate of DCLN/LN was 15/188
  (SM group) versus 30/190, respectively (p = 0.03). An uptake of the blue bye
  was observed in a total of 45 out of 388 LN. Conclusion: An intraoperative
  combination of cervico-subserosal myometrium application of the blue dye allows
  successful detection (83.3%) of sentinel LN in patients with endometrial
  cancer. Comparing SM and CSM groups the statistical significant difference was
  found in the DCLN/LN rate and mean number of sentinel lymph nodes (p = 0.03, p
  = 0.05, respectively). Clinical validity of this surgical procedure must be
  assessed prospectively.

AB: In this paper we review the published research that has investigated the
  psychological impact of arm morbidity associated with axillary dissection for
  early breast cancer. This critique is particularly timely given the drive
  towards minimally invasive techniques, such as sentinel node biopsy, which aim
  to reduce the incidence and severity of post-operative arm problems. Reported
  symptoms are multifactorial and include numbness, pain, swelling,
  weakness/stiffness, and restricted shoulder mobility of the affected arm.
  Conclusions from the few studies that have investigated the severity,
  incidence, duration and psychological impact of such disability are often
  limited by methodological problems. We identify these limitations and examine
  assessment tools used to determine the psychological impact of lymphoedema. The
  paper highlights the need for methodological rigor in study design, and the
  careful selection of appropriate, sensitive, reliable and clinically meaningful
  outcome measures to evaluate the impact of post-operative arm morbidity.

AB: Background. The axillary lymph node (ALN) status is still the most important
  prognostic factor in the staging and treatment of breast cancer. Intraoperative
  lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymphadenectomy techniques were investigated in
  patients with early-stage breast cancer who did not have clinically palpable
  ALNs. Methods. Forty-four patients with breast cancer underwent a sentinel
  lymph node biopsy (SLNB), followed by a complete axillary lymphadenectomy.
  Sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) were detected by means of so-called 2-way mapping
  with coloring matter and an isotope. Our standard protocol for evaluating
  metastasis in SLNs included a frozen section at 1 level for reverse
  transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), plus a paraffin section at 1
  level for immunohistochemistry (IHC) of cytokeratin 19, while the rest were
  evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. Results. SLNs were identified in
  42 (95%) of 44 patients. Twenty-one patients had no metastasis in SLNs;
  however, ALN metastasis was found in 3 patients. Of these 3 patients, 2 had
  micrometastasis detected by means of either IHC or RT-PCR. Therefore the false
  -negative rate was decreased from 7% (3/44) to 2% (1/44). Furthermore, of the
  remaining 18 ALN-negative patients, micrometastasis was detected by means of
  either IHC or RT-PCR in 7 (39%) patients. Conclusion. We suggest that SLNB is
  recommended to detect micrometastasis by means of H&E staining, IHC, and RT
  -PCR. Omitting ALN dissection referred by SLNB should be avoided if SLNs were
  evaluated only by H&E staining, and/or IHC without RT-PCR.

AB: The sentinel node is defined as the first node(s) in the lymphatic basin(s)
  to which the primary melanoma drains. Because this node(s) receives primary
  lymphatic flow, it is also the node(s) most at risk for melanoma metastases.
  Sentinel node biopsy is known as a compromise between the two traditional
  alternatives of an elective lymph node dissection, or observation of the
  regional nodal basin followed by a therapeutic lymph node dissection once
  disease becomes clinically apparent. We report our experience with the
  technique of sentinel node biopsy using patent blue V dye in patients with
  malignant melanoma. These two sentinel nodes were not found to contain
  micrometastasis. Two prospective, randomized trials are currently attempting to
  prove the efficacy of sentinel node biopsy.

AB: The overall objective of this study is to promote the development of
  environmental health indicators in Mexico City. Specific examples focused on
  water quality, household characteristics e.g., sanitation and risk of enteric
  diseases. A geographic information system (GIS) was used in order to identify
  eligible wells and their surrounding homesteads (0.5 km around each well). A
  pilot study was conducted during the rainy season (1999), and a total of 1, 250
  eligible households were visited on a random sample basis; only those having
  children under 5 years of age were interviewed. Data on diarrheal disease (i.e.
  occurrence in the previous two weeks) were obtained from 950 children, and
  their guardians provided information on their water supply, sanitation and
  socioeconomic variables. A total of 320 water samples were obtained from 40
  wells, and tested for Total coliforms (TC/100 ml), Fecal coliforms (FC/100 ml).
  Escherichia coli (EC) and Fecal streptococci (FS). Bacterial indicators were
  detected in 40% of the wells in the western zone and in 32% of the southern
  zone (p = 0.01). The rate of diarrheal diseases was higher for children from
  the southern areas than in the west (OR = 1.7 and 95% CI: 0.99, 2.86). The
  final analysis showed a higher risk of diarrhea in children from rented homes
  than those living in owned dwellings (OR = 1.7 and 95% Cl: 1.04, 2.77): the
  risk was also highest for children living in houses with poor sanitation
  facilities (e.g., latrine) than those connected to a sewerage (OR = 1.7 and 95%
  Cl: 1.00, 2.93). Children from households perceiving unpleasant taste of water
  showed a higher risk than those without complaints (OR = 2.2 and 95% Cl: 1.28,
  3.75). Linkages between environmental factors and health risk were created from
  spatially distributed information, and the proposed environmental health
  indicator (EHI) summarized the most significant predictors of diarrheal
  diseases. This baseline information may contribute to further environmental
  health investigation and policy making analysis.

AB: The expanding use of genetically engineered mice has placed increasing
  demands upon research facilities to import mutant strains from noncommercial
  sources. Conventional quarantine strategies use relatively large amounts of
  space per animal and/or require specialized equipment (e.g., cubicles,
  isolators, and ventilated racks). We have retrospectively assessed a quarantine
  program instituted 4 years ago that used a small amount of space and minimized
  the need for special equipment. Shipments presumed, in light of health reports,
  to be free of agents excluded from our colonies were housed in static
  microisolator caging in a shared quarantine room. Rather than functioning as an
  "all-in-all-out" area, the room continually received new shipments, which were
  released intermittently as multi-shipment groups after testing was performed.
  Noninvasive testing of the imported mice was combined with nonsurvival sampling
  of sentinels that had been exposed to shipped animals via direct contact and/or
  exposure to soiled bedding. During the 4-year period examined, the vast
  majority of shipments presumed to be free of excluded agents showed no evidence
  of contamination when screened. When active infection was detected in the
  shared room, the procedures in place proved sufficient to prevent cross
  -contamination of other shipments. The use of sentinel animals to detect the
  shedding of infectious agents during quarantine was found to be an effective
  strategy that minimized the potential impact of invasive testing on quarantined
  animals. Although the program we describe is not appropriate for all
  situations, this type of approach may be considered by institutions wishing to
  explore alternatives to conventional quarantine strategies during periods of
  restricted space availability.

  lymphatics of the lung and the dissemination of tumor cells to the intra- and
  extrathoracic lymph nodes are described. The incidence of involvement of the
  different lymph node sites in the chest is analyzed. The involvement of the
  contralateral hilar and/or supraclavicular lymph nodes and the consequences for
  target volume selection for curative radiotherapy are discussed. CT-based nodal
  classification and distribution of lymph nodes in the chest in CT-axial slices
  are presented. The sentinel node concept (SNC) and the preliminary data
  available for lung cancer are described. Results: A critical review of the
  current TNM classification for lung cancer and the implications for target
  volume selection is given. The individual target volume selection and
  delineation have to be based on clinical and pathological data from Large
  surgical studies and upon the individual pathological and diagnostic patient
  data. The selection and delineation of the clinical target volumes for
  definitive and for postoperative radiotherapy, dependent on the Lymph node
  involvement, are presented. Conclusions: Criteria for the selection and
  delineation of the clinical target volumes for definitive and for postoperative
  conformal radiotherapy in axial CT slices under consideration of site, size and
  stage of the lung cancer are described. Recommendations for target volume
  selection for definitive or postoperative radiotherapy are presented.

AB: The fight against HIV/AIDS poses enormous challenges worldwide, generating
  fears that success may be too difficult or even impossible to attain. Uganda
  has demonstrated that an early, consistent and multisectoral control strategy
  can reduce both the prevalence and the incidence of HIV infection. From only
  two AIDS cases in 1982, the epidemic in Uganda grew to a cumulative 2 million
  HIV infections by the end of 2000. The AIDS Control Programme established in
  1987 in the Ministry of Health mounted a national response that expanded over
  time to reach other relevant sectors under the coordinating role of the Uganda
  AIDS Commission. The national response was to bring in new policies, expanded
  partnerships, increased institutional capacity for care and research, public
  health education for behaviour change, strengthened sexually transmitted
  disease (STD) management, improved blood transfusion services, care and support
  services for persons with HIV/AIDS, and a surveillance system to monitor the
  epidemic. After a decade of fighting on these fronts, Uganda became, in October
  1996, the first African nation to report declining trends in HIV infection.
  Further decline in prevalence has since been noted. The Medical Research
  Council (UK) and the Uganda Virus Research Institute have demonstrated
  declining HIV incidence rates in the general population in the Kyamulibwa in
  Masaka Districts. Repeat knowledge, attitudes, behaviour and practice studies
  have shown positive changes in the priority prevention indicators. The data
  suggest that a comprehensive national response supported by strong political
  commitment may be responsible for the observed decline. Other countries in sub
  -Saharan Africa can achieve similar results by these means. Since success is
  possible, anything less is unacceptable.

AB: In June 1999, the dioxin crisis, caused by dioxin-contaminated feed
  components, exploded in Belgium, resulting in withdrawal of chicken and eggs
  from the market. Through the sentinel surveillance system, a decrease in
  Campylobacter infections during June 1999 was noticed. A model was generated
  with the reports from preceding years (1994 to 1998), and a prediction of the
  number of infections in 1999 was calculated. The model shows a significant
  decline (40%) in the number of infections, mainly because of the withdrawal of
  poultry. The use of a disaster as an epidemiologic tool offers a unique
  opportunity to observe exceptional changes in the occurrence of infections or
  other diseases.

AB: Background: Previous data indicating wide racial disparities in HIV
  seroprevalence, associations between sentinel sexually transmitted diseases
  (STDs) and HIV infection, and recent reports of STD outbreaks among men who
  have sex with men (MSM) have raised concerns that HIV may be resurgent among
  MSM. Goal: To measure trends in HIV seroprevalence and describe racial
  disparities among MSM presenting to New York City Department of Health STD
  clinics, 1990-1999 (n = 4076). Study Design: This blinded HIV-1 serosurvey used
  remnant serum originally drawn for routine serologic tests for syphilis.
  Demographic, risk factor, clinical and laboratory data were abstracted from
  clinic charts of patients whose medical records documented sexual contact with
  men or with both men and women ("bisexual" men). Data were matched to the
  specimens, and all personal identifiers were removed before testing. Patients
  were not interviewed. Results: The sample was 41% black, 20% Hispanic, 31%
  white, and 9% of other or mixed race/ethnicity. Sixty-one percent of the
  patients were >30 years of age; 21% were gtoreq40 years of age. One-third had
  sex with women as well as men. For 60%, laboratory-confirmed STD diagnosis was
  made on the serosurvey visit. Overall, HIV seroprevalence declined from 47% in
  1990 to 18% in 1999 (P < 0.01). Seroprevalence declined from 34% to 11% among
  white men (n = 1250), from 47% to 19% among Hispanic men (n = 795), from 56% to
  28% among black men (n = 1656), and from 43% to 14% among men who had sex with
  both men and women (n = 1447). Seroprevalence among MSM with gonorrhea (n =
  507) declined but remained high (57-34%; P < 0.05). In contrast, seroprevalence
  among MSM with nongonococcal urethritis (n = 953) declined from 36% to 16% (P <
  0.01), and seroprevalence among MSM who had no STD (n = 1650) dropped from 48%
  to 12% (P < 0.01). Gonorrhea was diagnosed almost twice as frequently among
  seropositive versus seronegative MSM (19% versus 10%; P < 0.05). Black MSM were
  not more or less likely to have been tested for HIV or to be diagnosed with
  acute STD than were MSM in the other-race/ethnicity group. Positive serostatus
  was associated with black race/ethnicity (odds ratio (OR), 2.5; 95% CI, 2.1
  -2.9), age >25 years (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.9-3.1), and a diagnosis of gonorrhea
  (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 2.0-2.8). Sixty percent of seropositive MSM knew their
  serostatus from confidential or anonymous HIV testing at this or a previous
  visit. Two thirds of the known seropositive men had a new STD diagnosed at the
  serosurvey visit. Conclusion: Seroprevalence in this racially diverse sample of
  MSM declined significantly during the study period. However, wide racial
  disparities in seroprevalence were observed that were not attributable to
  disparities in risk factors such as STD, bisexuality, or acceptance of HIV
  testing. This finding suggests that the observed differences may reflect racial
  differences in the background seroprevalences, such as those seen in all New
  York City serosurvey samples and the population-based AIDS case rates. High
  prevalence associated with gonorrhea and new STD in known seropositive men of
  any race suggests that continued efforts to control the incidence of STD,
  increased encouragement of MSM to accept HIV counseling and testing, and
  prevention-focused counseling of seropositive men are needed.

AB: BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate the author's recent,
  preliminary experience with the sentinel lymph node procedure in patients with
  vulvar melanoma and to compare this experience with treatment and follow-up of
  patients with vulvar melanomas who were treated previously at their
  institution. METHODS: From 1997, sentinel lymph node procedure with the
  combined technique (99mTechnetium-labeled nanocolloid and Patente Blue-V) was
  performed as a standard staging procedure for patients with vulvar melanoma
  with a thickness >1 mm and no clinically suspicious inguinofemoral lymph nodes.
  For the current study, clinicopathologic data from all 33 patients with vulvar
  melanoma who were treated between 1978 and 2000 at the University Hospital
  Groningen were reviewed and analyzed. RESULTS: From January 1997 until December
  2000, identification of sentinel lymph nodes was successful in all nine
  patients who were referred for treatment of vulvar melanoma. Three patients
  underwent subsequent complete inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy because of
  metastatic sentinel lymph nodes. In follow-up, groin recurrences (in-transit
  metastases) occurred in two of nine patients, both 12 months after primary
  treatment. Both patients had melanomas with a thickness >4 mm and previously
  had negative sentinel lymph nodes. There was a trend toward more frequent groin
  recurrences in patients after undergoing the sentinel lymph node procedure (2
  of 9 patients) compared with 24 historic control patients (0 of 24 patients;
  P=0.06). Five of 33 patients developed local recurrences: Two patients had
  groin recurrences, and 11 patients developed distant metastases. Twelve
  patients died of vulvar melanoma. Seventeen patients with a median follow-up of
  66 months (range, 9-123 months) are currently alive (overall survival rate,
  52%). CONCLUSIONS: Although the numbers were small, this study showed that the
  sentinel lymph node procedure is capable of identifying patients who have
  occult lymph node metastases and who may benefit from lymphadenectomy for
  locoregional control and prevention of distant metastases. However, the data
  also suggest that the sentinel lymph node procedure may increase the risk of
  locoregional recurrences (in-transit metastases), especially in patients with
  thick melanomas. The potential role of the sentinel lymph node procedure as an
  alternative method of lymph node staging in patients with vulvar melanoma needs
  further investigation only within the protection of clinical trials and
  probably should be restricted to patients with melanomas with intermediate
  thickness (1-4 mm).

AB: BACKGROUND: Axillary lymph node involvement (ALNI) remains the most accurate
  predictive factor for recurrence risk and survival in patients with invasive
  breast carcinoma (IBC) and is an essential element in therapeutic decisions.
  However, axillary dissection (AD) is responsible for several side effects and
  is now discussed in small IBC. The objective of this study was to define a
  predictive model of ALNI by using clinical and histologic variables available
  before surgery. METHODS: The authors studied 795 cases of IBC (T0, T1,
  T2ltoreq4 cm; N0; M0) treated between 1980 and 1997 by conservative surgery and
  radiation therapy. All cases had axillary dissection with at least 10 lymph
  nodes removed. A stepwise logistic regression analysis was performed to build a
  predictive model of ALNI. The authors then used the jackknife resampling
  technique to produce unbiased estimates of the probabilities of ALNI along with
  their confidence intervals. RESULTS: The global ALNI rate was 25.7%. The final
  predictive model included clinical tumor size, location, and histologic subtype
  and grade as variables independently associated with ALNI. The estimated
  probability of ALNI varied from 6% to 45%, according to case characteristics
  for these variables. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that the omission of AD in
  surgical procedures for these tumors is debatable. Even when ALNI rates were
  low, the superior bounds of the confidence intervals could be high.
  Consequently, we do not recommend to omit AD in women whose estimated risks are
  higher than 25%. Women with a risk of ALNI lower than 25% could benefit from
  the sentinel lymph node procedure with, likewise, a limited risk of false
  -negative.

AB: Objectives: To assess therapeutic efficacy of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP)
  in treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria 3 years after
  introduction in Mpumalanga, South Africa. Setting: Tonga district with a
  population of 116 418 and subject to seasonal malaria, with an average annual
  incidence of 3 200 cases. Subjects: One hundred and nineteen malaria patients
  presenting to a sentinel surveillance clinic and recruited according to World
  Health Organisation (WHO) criteria. Methodology: Patients satisfying WHO
  inclusion criteria were treated with a single oral dose of SP and the response
  of infection to treatment in each patient wag routinely monitored clinically
  and parasitologically on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 42 post-treatment. One
  hundred and ten patients completed follow-up to day 42 or evidence of clinical
  or parasitological failure. Results: The cure rate at day 42 was 93.6%
  (103/110). Two patients (1.8%, RII) were early treatment failures on day 3,
  while recrudescence (4.5%, RI) occurred in 5 patients on day 28 (N=3) and on
  day 42 (N=2). Conclusion: In Mpumalanga P. falciparum remains sensitive to SP,
  with no significant difference between the baseline cure rate (94.5%) and the
  cure rate in the present study (93.6%).

AB: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are xenobiotics whose elevated toxicity for
  living organisms requires to efficiently monitor air pollution, either by
  evaluating their levels in the environment, or by assessing their biological
  impacts on sentinel organisms. We investigated the effects of naphthalene
  exposure on some xenobiotic-metabolising enzyme activities in three organs of
  Helix aspersa. Particular activities depending on cytochrome P450
  (ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase, EROD; ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase, ECOD;
  pentoxyresorufin O-dealkylase, PROD) and associated with glutathione
  (glutathione S-transferase, GST; glutathione peroxidase, GPX; glutathione
  reductase, GR) were assessed. In control animals, the P450-dependent specific
  activities were distributed according to the range kidney>digestive
  gland>mantle cavity forming tissues (MCFT). Neither ECOD nor PROD activities
  could be detected in MCFT. In the two other organs, the major phase I
  activities were due to ECOD, the level of PROD being very low or null. The
  glutathione-associated activities showed comparable levels in the three organs,
  except GPX activity that was higher in the digestive gland. Naphthalene (NAP)
  exposure did not affect any activity in MCFT, but it significantly decreased
  EROD and ECOD activities in the kidney as opposed to their increase in the
  digestive gland, whereas PROD activities were not influenced by the treatment.
  Glutathione-dependent activities were not significantly affected by NAP
  exposure, except for GPX which activity diminished in the digestive gland. This
  study demonstrates that complex detoxification pathways should exist in Helix
  aspersa as in mammals and that they could be used as potential biomarkers of
  NAP exposure.

AB: There is a concern over use of antibiotics, especially tetracyclines, in
  agriculture and the possibility of resistance transfer by consumption. 50
  million lbs. of antibiotics are produced in the US each year, 20 million lbs.
  for animals of which 80% is used to promote growth. We previously used the TSN
  Database USA to track TetR in clinical isolates over 5 years. Here we
  complemented that data using discriminators of age, gender, and two comparator
  antibiotics. A Database of 250 institutions was used to create antibiograms via
  the parameters of age (<18, 18-65, >65 yr), gender and time 1997-2000 (total or
  yearly). Sentinel clinical marker organisms included S. pneumoniae, E.
  faecalis, E. faecium, S. pyogenes, S. aureus, and E coli. Three antibiotics
  including Tet and levofloxacin and either ampicillin, penicillin, erythromycin,
  vancomycin, or oxacillin were assayed. At the time of analysis there were
  2,774,158 strains and 35,709,005 results based on 1,748,292 patients in the
  data base. The yearly lb per capita consumption of beef, fish, and poultry in
  the US from 1990-1998, respectively, was stable ranging from 112.3 to 115.6, 15
  to 14.8, and 56.3 to 68.4. For Gram positive bacteria S. pneumoniae (23-19%),
  S. pyogenes (14.3-15%), and S. aureus (13.1-9.4%) TetR was stable over the
  three years, with resistance changes less than 6%; comparator antibiotics had
  parallel stable patterns. TetR segregated by age showed a similar profile, with
  a suggestion of less resistance in the >65 group. As an example TetR in S.
  pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. aureus, and E. coli for <18, 18-65, >65
  respectively changed from 25-19%, 10-8%, 5-7%, and 94-85% over the three years.
  Gender did not alter results. Only Enterococcus sp showed a measurable
  resistance trend. This was observed for levofloxacin/E. faecalis (5-45%) and
  both TetR/E. faecium (46%-63%) and levofloxacin/E. faecium (73%-92%). This
  report, the third by us, uses the largest database via electronic surveillance
  in the US. This and our previous analysis does not support that the consumption
  of agricultural products is a unique risk factor in selecting resistant
  phenotypes, using tetracycline as a marker.

AB: This study attempted control of transmission of Echinococcus granulosus from
  dogs to sheep in different areas in the Department of Florida, Uruguay, by
  treating dogs with praziquantel at intervals of 6, 12 and 16 weeks. The 6-week
  interval was based on the prepatent period of infection with E. granulosus, the
  12- and 16-week intervals were based on the rate of reinfection with tapeworms
  in dogs in the area. Dogs had become reinfected with E. granulosus between 2
  and 4 months after treatment, whereas they became reinfected with the Taenia
  spp. tapeworms within 2 months of treatment. One year after the start of
  treatments sentinel lambs were born and grazed the farms in the three treatment
  areas. Approximately, 15 months later when the sentinel lambs were killed and
  examined for parasites the six weekly treatments had stopped the transmission
  of E. granulosus to the sentinel lambs. Treatment of dogs at 12- and 16-week
  intervals failed to stop transmission of E. granulosus but both the numbers of
  farms and the numbers of sheep infected with E. granulosus were lower where
  dogs received 12 weekly treatments compared with dogs receiving 16 weekly
  treatments and a fourth area where dogs had received no treatments
  (chi2P=0.002). Lambs continued to become infected with the Taenia spp.
  tapeworms in all the areas. Control was complicated by large changes in the dog
  population. From a starting population of 1164 dogs in the three treated areas,
  832 new dogs, most of these adult hunting dogs, entered the population and 793
  dogs were lost from the population.

AB: A putative seven transmembrane protein gene, stm1+, which is required for
  proper recognition of nitrogen starvation signals, was isolated as a multicopy
  suppressor of a ras1 synthetic lethal mutant in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.
  Under nitrogen-deficient conditions, transcription of the stm1 gene was
  induced; deletion of stm1 was associated with early entry into G1 arrest. Under
  nutritionally sufficient conditions, overexpression of Stm1 inhibited
  vegetative cell growth, resulted in decreased intracellular cAMP levels,
  increased the expression of the meiosis-specific genes ste11, mei2, and mam2,
  and facilitated sexual development in homothallic cells. However inhibition of
  vegetative cell growth and reduction of cAMP levels were not observed in a
  deletion mutant of the heterotrimeric G protein Galpha2 gene, gpa2, that is
  responsible for regulating intracellular cAMP levels, a key factor in
  determining the sexual development in S. pombe. Stm1 protein was shown to
  interact with Gpa2 through its C-terminal transmembrane domains 5-7. Mutation
  at Lys199 in the C-terminal domain (stm1K199A) abolished the Stm1
  overexpression effect on lowering cAMP levels. Induction of ste11, a meiosis
  -specific gene transcription factor, by Stm1 overexpression was enhanced in
  gpa2-deleted cells but was absent in a deletion mutant of sty1, a key protein
  kinase that links mitotic control with environmental signals and induces stress
  -responsive genes. Moreover, deletion of both stm1 and ras1 caused delayed
  entry into G1 arrest in S. pombe when the cells were grown in a nitrogen
  -deficient medium. Thus we consider that the stm1 gene can function through
  Gpa2-dependent and/or -independent pathways and may play a role in providing
  the prerequisite state for entering the pheromone-dependent differentiation
  cycle in which heterotrimeric Galpha1 protein, Gpa1, and Ras1 play major roles.
  Stm1 could function as a sentinel molecule sensing the nutritional state of the
  cells, stopping the proliferative cell cycle, and preparing the cell to enter
  meiosis under nutritionally deficient conditions.

AB: The use and interpretation of cytokeratin (CK) immunostains of sentinel
  lymph node specimens for breast carcinoma remain controversial. Variable
  immunoreactivity with and-CK antibodies and CK-positive interstitial reticulum
  cells may complicate interpretation. The authors examined a series of reactive
  lymph nodes selected from patients without a history of malignancy. To
  demonstrate potential diagnostic pitfalls, three different CK antibody
  combinations were studied to characterize the immunostaining patterns. Formalin
  -fixed sections of lymph nodes were immunostained with a labeled streptavidin
  -biotin method using a DAKO autostainer. The anti-CK antibody preparations
  evaluated were AE1/AE3, CAM 5.2, and an in-house-prepared CK cocktail composed
  of 7 antibodies. The authors observed that up to 10% of cells in benign,
  reactive lymph nodes may be immunoreactive with anti-CK antibodies. AE1/AE3
  stained 2 of 20 cases with rare immunoreactive reticulum cells, whereas CAM 5.2
  and the CK cocktail immunostained cells in 85% of cases with reticulum cells in
  sinuses and the paracortex. Rare positive to 2+ cells were present in a similar
  distribution with these two antibodies. Careful interpretation of CK
  immunostaining of sentinel lymph node biopsies is essential, as is awareness of
  the presence of CK-positive native reticulum cells, to avoid confusion with
  single cells of metastatic carcinoma.

AB: Melanomas can be difficult to diagnose histologically if they deviate in
  their growth pattern or cytology only minimally from a nevus. On occasion, even
  experts on melanocytic lesions may not reach a consensus on whether a lesion is
  a benign but unusual nevus or a malignant melanoma mimicking a nevus. This
  diagnostic dilemma is particularly well known for the distinction of Spitz
  nevus from melanoma. Diagnostic uncertainty and disagreement among consultant
  pathologists lead to confusion about the prognosis and clinical management of
  patients. In this study we present the clinical and pathologic findings of 10
  patients with diagnostically controversial melanocytic tumors, who underwent
  sentinel lymph node biopsy. In all of these cases, the diagnostic controversy
  among experts was between Spitz nevus and melanoma. Seven patients were female,
  and three were male, ranging in age from 7 to 46 years (mean 21 years).
  Histologic examination of the sentinel lymph nodes revealed tumor deposits in
  the lymph node parenchyma in 5 of 10 patients. Among patients with positive
  sentinel lymph nodes, two had satellite nodules and one showed additional tumor
  deposits in three nonsentinel regional lymph nodes. All patients are alive and
  free of disease with a follow-up of 10-54 months (mean 34 months). Our study
  illustrates the role of a sentinel lymph node biopsy in the evaluation of
  patients with diagnostically controversial melanocytic tumors. Although the
  presence of metastatic tumor deposits in the sentinel lymph node supports the
  diagnosis of malignant melanoma, further studies are needed to determine the
  prognostic significance of the sentinel lymph node findings in such patients.

AB: Background: The sentinel lymph node has been used in several tumors. The aim
  of this study was to analyze the accuracy of the sentinel node in papillary
  thyroid carcinoma. Methods: A series of 22 patients with papillary thyroid
  carcinoma were included. Approximately 0.5 cc of isosulfan blue dye was
  injected at operation to trace the sentinel node. Lymph node dissection of the
  ipsilateral central compartment and extensive sampling of the jugular
  compartment were performed in addition to sentinel node resection. Surgical
  specimens were stained with hematoxylin-eosin, and negative sentinel nodes were
  subsequently stained with immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin-7. Results: Mean
  age was 37+-14 years. Twenty patients were women, and 2 were men. Mean tumor
  size was 2.5+-1 cm. A sentinel lymph node was found in 20 patients. With use of
  hematoxylin-eosin, metastases were identified in 12/20 sentinel nodes (60%).
  Eleven patients with positive sentinel nodes presented additional lymph node
  metastases: 9 in the central compartment, 1 in the jugular compartment, and 1
  in both compartments. Two patients with negative sentinel nodes had lymph node

AB: OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to examine whether transcranial
  electrical motor evoked potential (MEP) monitoring is safe, feasible, and
  valuable for brain tumor surgery. METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients
  undergoing brain tumor resection were studied, using nitrous oxide/propofol
  anesthesia. MEPs were continuously recorded throughout surgery, using a
  Sentinel 4 evoked potential system (Axon Systems, Inc., Hauppauge, NY). The
  MEPs were elicited by transcranial electrical stimulation (train of 5;
  stimulation rate, 0.5-2 Hz; square wave pulse with a time constant of 0.5 ms;
  stimulation intensity, 40-160 mA) through spiral electrodes placed over the
  primary motor cortex and were recorded by needle electrodes inserted into the
  contralateral orbicularis oris, biceps, abductor pollicis brevis, and anterior
  tibialis muscles. When MEP amplitudes decreased by more than 50%, MEP
  stimulation was repeated, with increased stimulation intensity, and MEP changes
  were reported to the surgeon. The motor function of each patient was examined
  before and after surgery, using a reproducible scale. The relationship between
  MEP amplitude decreases and worsening motor status was analyzed using linear
  regression. RESULTS: Preoperative neurological examinations revealed mild to
  moderate motor deficits (2/5 to 4/5) for 38% of patients (19 of 50 patients).
  Most of the patients (96%) exhibited recordable baseline MEPs. Persistent MEP
  decreases of more than 50% were noted for eight patients (16%) (11 muscles).
  The MEPs were completely abolished in two patients (three muscles). The degree
  of postoperative worsening of motor status was correlated with the degree of
  intraoperative MEP amplitude reduction (r=-0.864; P<0.001). CONCLUSION:
  Persistent intraoperative MEP reductions of more than 50% were associated with
  postoperative motor deficits. The degree of MEP amplitude reduction was
  correlated with postoperative worsening of motor status. Transcranial
  electrical MEP monitoring is feasible, safe, and valuable for brain tumor
  surgery.

AB: The effect of host weed phenology, abundance, and diversity and natural
  enemies on the population dynamics of the southern green stink bug, Nezara
  viridula (L.), in Hawaiian macadamia orchards was investigated. We found that
  the highest kernel damage occurred immediately following abrupt reductions in
  the flowering and fruiting stages of host weeds. Areas with the greatest
  diversity of host weeds showed higher damage, presumably because of higher N.
  viridula population levels. Predation rates on sentinel egg masses were highest
  over the two seasons in areas where the bigheaded ant, Pheidole megacephala
  (F.), comprised a large portion of the ant fauna. In one of the orchards, P.
  megacephala and the longlegged ant, Anoplolepis longipes (Jerdon), occurred in
  a spatial mosaic where the boundaries shifted back and forth over time.
  Sentinel egg masses placed in these two adjacent areas showed predation rates
  were highest in the areas dominated by P. megacephala, and intermediate in the
  interface zone and lowest where only A. longipes were found. The importance of
  weed phenology and natural enemy induced mortality is discussed.

AB: The SPAn232 virus (SPAnv) was isolated from sentinel mice in the forest of
  Cotia, Sao Paulo, Brazil. It was grouped originally as a Cotia virus (CV)
  sample due to serological cross-reaction with the latter. However, SPAnv
  presented genetic characteristics that differed from CV and indicated that
  SPAnv is a member of the vaccinia virus (VV) subgroup. SPAnv showed a HindIII
  -digested DNA pattern similar to those of the WR and Lister strains of VV.
  Also, SPAnv presented genes homologous to the vaccinia growth factor, thymidine
  kinase and A-type inclusion (ATI) genes from VV. RFLP analysis of the SPAnv ATI
  homologous gene indicated that the virus belongs to the VV group. Nucleotide
  sequences from SPAnv genes showed up to 99% similarity with the same genes from
  VV. Such a relationship was confirmed visually through the drawing of
  phylogenetic trees. The results point out the occurrence of a VV strain that is
  possibly in active circulation in the forests of Southeast Brazil.

AB: Parasite-naive pony foals were used as sentinels to monitor transmission of
  gastrointestinal parasites of equids in Louisiana during 4 seasons of the year.
  Two annual periods were studied, 1988-1989 and 1992-1993. Two or 3 foals each
  season were turned out to graze a contaminated pasture along with resident
  parasitized mares and their foals. After a grazing period of 8 wk, sentinel
  ponies were held in a parasite-free box stall for a period of 6 wk to allow
  parasites to develop, thus enhancing the evaluation of hypobiotic stages.
  Following this holding period, necropsies were performed for complete parasite
  recoveries. Data show that transmission of large and small strongyles occurs
  during all seasons in southern Louisiana with highest levels of transmission
  occurring in the winter and only minimal transmission taking place in the
  summer. Numbers of mucosal cyathostomes, as well as total cyathostome numbers,
  were highest in the winter, and luminal cyathostome numbers were highest in the
  spring. Transmission of Anoplocephala perfoliata and Parascaris equorum
  occurred during all seasons of the year, although numbers of P. equorum were
  reduced in spring 1989 and 1993. Gasterophilus intestinalis instars were
  recovered from fall and winter sentinels only. Oxyuris equi L4 were found all
  seasons 1 yr. but only during the fall and winter of the final year.

  genotoxicity, and cancer. These effects occurred most often and were most
  severe in the most contaminated sites (Green Bay, Saginaw Bay, Lake Ontario,
  the St. Lawrence estuary, and more recently, Lake Erie), some of which are
  International Joint Commission-designated Areas of Concern (AOCs). In all
  cases, a strong argument can be made for an environmental etiology, and in many
  cases for the involvement of persistent organic pollutants, particularly
  polychlorinated biphenyls, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, and polycyclic
  aromatic hydrocarbons. For some, the association with particular contaminants
  is consistent with controlled studies, and in some, dose-response relationships
  were documented. The biologic significance of these health impairments to the
  affected species is currently unclear, but they resemble those observed with
  increased incidence in human subpopulations in one or more AOCs. Formalizing
  health effects monitoring of sentinel wildlife species by the parties to the
  Canada-USA Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement is required. This would
  facilitate the optimal use of sentinel wildlife health data in a larger,
  epidemiologic weight-of-evidence context upon which to base decisions and
  policies regarding the effects of chemical exposures on human populations.

AB: 1. Sentinel behaviour involves a unique cooperative system of dedicated look
  -outs which protect members of their social group from attack by predators.
  Using detailed observations from groups of Arabian babblers, Turdoides
  squamiceps, we tested the original theoretical suggestion that cooperative
  sentinel systems are simply the result of individually selfish state-dependent
  patterns of behaviour. 2. Sentinel effort and the number of sentinel bouts per
  individual per hour were greater for males than females, and both increased
  with individual dominance status within the group. 3. Sentinel behaviour was
  unaffected by group social structure, in terms of patterns of relatedness and
  the number of potential breeders. 4. Total group sentinel effort increased with
  group size, while the effort per individual decreased irrespective of sex and
  dominance rank. Simultaneous sentinel behaviour by two or more birds was very
  rare, but increased with group size. 5. Sentinel effort followed seasonal
  fluctuations in food availability, but not peaks of raptor migration through
  the study site. 6. Body mass was greater for males than females and was
  positively related to dominance rank. Overall, body mass explained much of the
  variation in individual sentinel effort both within and between birds. However,
  data on individual foraging performance could not be related to changes in body
  mass and thus to differences in sentinel effort. 7. Sentinel behaviour in
  groups of Arabian babblers therefore confirms many of the predictions arising
  from state-dependent models of cooperative, yet individually selfish, sentinel
  behaviour.

AB: As genetic and biological treatment modalities are developed that can be
  custom-designed for individual patients, the possibility that breast cancer can
  be managed as a chronic long-term disease becomes more real, and the
  requirement for minimally invasive surgical intervention used as part of a
  multidisciplinary treatment approach becomes more pressing. Rather than fearing
  that they will be replaced, surgeons should enthusiastically move into this
  dynamic phase in the development of new surgical techniques for the treatment
  of breast cancer. This article will discuss such techniques in three evolving
  areas: 1) management of the axilla after neoadjuvant chemotherapy; 2) sentinel
  node dissection; and 3) radiofrequency ablation of primary tumors of the breast.

AB: Within the scope of the multidisciplinary research project Valimar (1995
  -1999), the present study emphasizes the use of histopathological
  investigations to evaluate the effects of the different chemical impact of two
  small streams on the general health and condition of the two sentinel fish
  species, brown trout (Salmo trutta f. fario) and loach (Barbatula barbatula).
  Parasitological investigations were also included to assess a possible
  relationship between toxicant exposure, parasitic load, and the occurence of
  histopathological organ changes. According to the multitiered approach of the
  Valimar project, fish from the field, individuals exposed to stream water under
  semi-field conditions, and fish from laboratory experiments were investigated.
  Under semi-field conditions, the histopathological responses in brown trout
  proved to reflect the different levels of contamination of the two small
  streams more clearly than those detected in loach. When captured from the
  field, both fish species revealed, in most cases, a higher degree of
  histopathological alterations than those individuals exposed at the respective
  site under semi-field conditions. Simulation of the toxic load of the more
  polluted stream in a laboratory experiment did not result in the same kind of
  tissue lesions in brown trout as in the field and semi-field investigations.
  Whereas results from the laboratory experiments could be specified as "toxicant
  -induced", the histopathological alterations in fish from both semi-field and
  field studies represent stress responses which integrate the effects of various
  abiotic and biotic stress factors including both toxicants and parasitic
  diseases.

AB: We compared 99mTc-Tetrofosmin P-SPECT with radioguided SN biopsy in 101
  T1/T2 BC pts to predict axillary lymph node status. The day before surgery all
  pts underwent lymphoscintigraphy (LS) to mark the SN, following subdermal
  injection of 99mTc-colloidal sulphur surrounding the breast lesion. LS was
  combined with pre and intraoperative gamma probe. Previously, all pts had also
  undergone P-SPECT. ALND was performed in all cases. The SN(s) was detected in
  97/101 cases (96%) by LS and gamma probe; in the 4 missed cases P-SPECT
  predicted lymph node status. In the 97 comparable cases, radioguided SN biopsy
  showed a slightly higher accuracy than P-SPECT (94.8% vs 93.8%), but a higher
  false-negative rate (14.3% vs 8.6%); P-SPECT had a higher NPV (95.2% vs 92.5%).
  The two procedures when combined achieved 100% accuracy. Radioguided SN biopsy
  alone had 100% accuracy only in pts with BC <15 mm. P-SPECT had 3 false
  negative cases, 2 of which were micrometastatic SNs, and 3 false positives. P
  -SPECT identified 81.2% of cases with a single node, determined the exact
  number of nodes in 82.6% of cases with 1 to 3 node and correctly classified
  93.7% of pts as having ltoreq3 or >3 metastatic nodes. Radioguided SN biopsy
  seems indicated in selected, early stage, small BC pts, while P-SPECT shows a
  high sensitivity independent of primary tumor size, giving additional important
  preoperative prognostic information. The two procedures combined provided a
  better axillary lymph node status prediction in T1/T2 carcinomas, and could
  thus improve ALND pt selection.

AB: Three infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) isolates, CU82792, CU82805, and
  CU82808, were recovered from sentinel chickens placed with three different
  layer flocks of a large commercial poultry farm in New York State. The three
  isolates were classified as members of the DE072 serotype on the basis of 1)
  their S1 genes could be amplified with only a modified primer designed for the
  DE072 serotype and 2) their restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns,
  after digestion with endonucleases HaeIII, BstyI and XcmI, were
  indistinguishable from that of DE072 virus. Additional characterization of one
  of the isolates, CU82805, revealed that its S1 gene bears approximately 96%
  identity at the nucleotide level and 94% identity at the amino acid level with
  DE072. Yet, in an in vitro reciprocal virus neutralization test, only a one-way
  neutralization was observed, i.e., antiserum to CU82805 neutralized DE072,
  whereas CU82805 was not neutralized by DE072 antiserum. Implications of these
  findings with regard to IBV diagnosis and immunization are discussed.

AB: Reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic analyses of bile of a
  territorial benthic fish, oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau), indicated that fish
  from reference stations in the York and Elizabeth Rivers, Virginia, contained
  lower concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) metabolites than
  fish from polluted stations. PAH metabolite levels in the bile of fish from
  mildly polluted stations were 7 to 10 times greater than those from reference
  stations. PAH metabolite levels in fish from a moderately polluted station and
  a highly polluted station were, respectively, 20 and 50 times greater than
  those from reference stations. Differential patterns of five major PAH
  metabolites in fish from the same station suggested individual variability in
  metabolic pathways possibly further convoluted by the differential inductions
  or suppressions of hepatic mixed-function oxygenase isozyme systems under
  various natural or anthropogenic habitat parameters. PAH metabolite levels in
  the bile of oyster toadfish correlated well with the gradient of PAH
  contamination in the Elizabeth River sediments. High levels of biliary PAH
  metabolites were not detected in muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus) collected along
  the polluted sections of the Elizabeth River, probably due to their primarily
  herbivorous nature. Assuming that the hepatobiliary system and the
  gastrointestinal tract are the major routes of biotransformation and excretion
  of PAHs in the muskrats, the contaminated diet appears to be a more important
  routes of exposure of muskrats (and possibly oyster toadfish) to PAHs than the
  transdermal transfer. Occurrence permitting, we propose oyster toadfish as a
  useful biological sentinel for early detection of estuarine PAH pollution.

AB: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is an emerging surgical technique to
  improve lymph node staging for breast cancer. Despite the rapid development of
  this technique, there remain aspects of SLNB that need to be further defined to
  provide a standardized approach. Variables, including patient selection,
  technical details for the performance of SLNB, extent of pathologic evaluation
  of the sentinel lymph node, and the impact of micrometastases, are areas of
  controversy. This paper reviews the controversies and discusses available data
  as well as personal experience and opinion.

AB: Background. Sentinel lymph node (SN) biopsy will increasingly replace
  axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for staging in breast cancer. For daily
  practice, examination of the SN by serial sectioning (SS) and/or
  immunohistochemistry (IHC) is being promoted. Use of these techniques may
  result into stage migration due to the increased detection of micro-metastases.
  The consequence may be overshooting of patients with adjuvant therapy, as the
  prognostic relevance of (small) micro-metastases and isolated tumor cells is
  unclear. Methods. The prognostic impact of micro-metastases is determined by
  reviewing ALND studies with a follow up of at least 5 years, including more
  than 100 patients, before the SN era. Furthermore, studies in which
  conventionally haematoxylin-eosin (H&E) negative SNs are investigated for
  occult metastases by SS and/or IHC are reviewed. Results. In only one of eight
  studies, occult metastases were an independent risk factor for reduced
  survival. The outcome is dependent on the size of the nodal metastasis. IHC and
  SS as used in the SN procedure indeed induce a shift from pNO to pN1a
  (according to TNM). Conclusion. By the thorough pathologic examination of the
  SN, isolated tumor cells and micro-metastases are more frequently detected. We
  propose to classify small micro-metastases (ltoreq0.5 mm) in a separate
  pN1a(min) category (min for minimal) to prevent stage migration. As the
  prognostic relevance of isolated tumor cells and (small) micrometastases has
  not been proven, the value of adjuvant therapy can be questioned for patients
  with otherwise good prognostic factors.

AB: Israel has accumulated extensive information on bluetongue (BT) occurrence
  in sheep flocks and sentinel cattle in various regions of the country for more
  than 30 years. Meteorological parameters had not been independently correlated
  with the occurrence of BT over the entire period. Meteorological parameters
  preceding years with high prevalence of bluetongue (1975, 1987, 1988 and 1994)
  (average of 43 sheep flocks affected) were compared with those for years with
  little or no BT transmission (1980, 1981, 1983 and 1992). Winters preceding
  high BT seasons were significantly warmer, the average maximum temperature of
  the coldest month was 2 to 3degreeC higher, and the average maximum and minimum
  temperatures were 1-2degreeC higher. After extremely dry and warm winters over
  the eastern Mediterranean, such as those of 1998 and 1999, single cases of BT
  occurred in 1998 and none in 1999. Rainfall in BT outbreak years was
  approximately normal, whereas winters preceding low-BT seasons were wetter (40%
  more rainfall than average in the coldest month and 17% more winter rainfall
  overall). BT outbreak years had significantly more winter days with maximum
  temperatures higher than 13 or 18degreeC (in the Innerland and in the Arava
  regions, respectively), and more nights with minimum temperatures > 5degreeC.
  Average maximum temperatures below 16.5degreeC for the coldest winter month
  were associated with low-BT seasons, while winters with more than 18 days
  warmer than 18degreeC were followed by high BTV transmission. In most parts of
  Israel except in mountains >700 m above sea level, the average maximum
  temperature of the coldest winter month is >12.5degreeC, which is thought to
  enable the survival of BT viruses. Mountain areas also have fewer animals/km2
  than lowland areas, and more of these are BT-resistant ruminants such as goats.
  Two candidates for "safe zones" with regard to export of ruminants and their
  products are proposed: the Arava Rift Valley and mountains above 700 m.
  Bluetongue outbreaks are not known in these regions. The Arava is assumed to be
  a particularly low-risk region because there are smaller numbers and presumed
  lower survival of the principal vector, Culicoides imicola. The Arava Rift
  Valley is also beyond the Persian Trough air stream, which seems to be
  connected with the introduction of BT vectors into Israel. These safe zones
  might be exploited for export of animals and germplasm.

AB: The detection of occult metastatic breast cancer cells by RT-PCR is limited
  by the poor specificity of most tumour mRNA markers. MAGE-A3 is a highly
  specific tumour mRNA marker that is not expressed in non-cancer cells. This
  study assesses MAGE-A3 mRNA as a molecular marker for the detection of tumour
  cells in the sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) of breast cancer patients. Serial
  frozen sections of SLN (n=121) were obtained from 77 AJCC (American Joint
  Committee on Cancer) Stage I-IIIA breast cancer patients. MAGE-A3 mRNA analysis
  of SLN was performed by RT-PCR and Southern blot analysis. Tumour cells were
  detected in 48 of 121 (40%) SLN from 77 patients by H&E or IHC staining, and 35
  of 77 (45%) patients, overall, had histopathologically (H&E and/or IHC)
  positive SLN. Among histopathologically negative SLN, 28 of 73 (38%) SLN were
  MAGE-A3 mRNA positive by RT-PCR. Overall, 41 of 77 (53%) patients and 50 of 121
  (41%) SLN were positive for MAGE-A3. MAGE-A3 mRNA expression in the SLN
  occurred more frequently with infiltrating lobular carcinoma (P<0.001) than
  with infiltrating ductal carcinoma, adding further evidence of possible
  phenotypic differences between these 2 subtypes of breast cancer. Due to its
  high specificity, MAGE-A3 mRNA is a potentially useful marker for detecting
  breast cancer cells in the SLN. One half of breast tumours expressed MAGE-A3
  mRNA, which has important potential implications for antigen-specific targeted
  immunotherapy.

AB: Cooperative sentinel behaviour in Arabian babblers, Turdoides squamiceps,
  appears generally consistent with state-dependent models of individually
  selfish antipredator behaviour. We examined further detailed aspects of this
  cooperative behaviour, including the suggestion that by engaging in this
  behaviour sentinels advertise their status and gain social prestige. Chosen
  sentinel locations were higher, but no more exposed, than the best alternative
  locations within 25 m. Sentinels started off closer to the centre of the
  foraging group than when sentinel bouts were terminated. Change-overs between
  sentinels were nearly always due to previous sentinels terminating their own
  bout. On the rare occasions when bouts were interrupted by upcoming sentinels,
  physical contact or aggression was extremely rare. Dominant males tended to
  terminate sentinel bouts of other birds, interrupting especially the dominant
  females. Other than this, there was no effect of an individual's sex or
  dominance rank on any aspect of sentinel change-overs or location choice when
  acting as a sentinel. There were also no differences in any sentinel activity
  between simple family groups, and those more complex nonfamily groups within
  which individuals compete for reproduction. Rates of alarm calling did not
  differ between group members, although dominant males did make more territorial
  calls to neighbouring groups while acting as a sentinel. Therefore, we found
  relatively little evidence that individuals compete for the chance to act as a
  sentinel as a means of showing off within groups of Arabian babblers. Instead,
  our study confirms the primary function of sentinels as a system of cooperative
  vigilance.

AB: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of pattern recognition receptors
  that are critical for cellular responses to a variety of bacterial, viral, and
  fungal products. Mast cells are important to host survival in a number of
  models of bacterial infection and might act as sentinel cells in host defense.
  We therefore examined the expression of TLRs and associated molecules by murine
  bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs). BMMCs and the murine mast cell line
  MC/9 expressed mRNA for TLR2, TLR4, and TLR6 but not TLR5 and for both adapter
  molecule MD-2 and signaling molecule MyD88 but lacked surface CD14. After
  activation with the TLR2- and TLR4-dependent stimuli Staphylococcus aureus
  -derived peptidoglycan and Escherichia coli-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS),
  respectively, mast cells produced significant levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6)
  and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). To determine whether mast cells
  require TLR4 for cellular responses to LPS, mast cells were derived from the
  bone marrow cells of C3H/HeJ and C57Bl/10ScNCr mice containing a point mutation
  and a null mutation, respectively, in TLR4. Using these models, we demonstrated
  that the BMMC IL-6 and TNF-alpha responses to LPS were completely dependent on
  functional TLR4 with no significant LPS response observed in its absence. These
  findings have important implications for the mechanism of mast cell responses
  to pathogens and their products and suggest that different TLR4-expressing
  cells might have different thresholds for activation with LPS.

AB: When Hereford heifers infested with Boophilus annulatus (Say) were treated
  with a single Ivomec SR Bolus, the concentration of ivermectin in the serum of
  the treated cattle reached a maximum of 8.8+-0.9 ppb at 2 wk posttreatment. The
  single bolus treatment resulted in 84.4% control of standard engorging B.
  annulatus females on treated cattle over the 20-wk trial. Although fewer
  engorged ticks were collected from the sentinel heifers exposed in the treated
  pasture than those in the control pasture at weeks 4, 10, and 16 posttreatment,
  none of the differences was statistically significant. Each exposure of
  sentinel cattle found free-living ticks in both the treated and control
  pastures, indicating the infestation was not eliminated by the treatment. When
  the trial was repeated using two Ivomec SR Boluses/heifer, the concentration of
  ivermectin in the serum of the treated cattle reached a maximum level of 31.2+
  -3.9 ppb at week 13 posttreatment. The use of two boluses/heifer resulted in
  99.6% control of standard engorging B. annulatus females over the 20-wk trial.
  No ticks were found on sentinels placed in the treated pasture after week 9
  posttreatment, an indication that the treatment had eliminated the free-living
  population in the treated pasture. From these studies, we conclude that a
  single Ivomec SR Bolus is incapable of sufficient control of B. annulatus to
  meet the rigid requirements of the Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program in
  South Texas. Although two boluses per animal did eliminate the ticks from
  treated heifers and the pasture they were in, the treatment would not be
  sufficiently efficacious for mature cattle (>400 kg) for it to be useful in the
  program.

AB: BACKGROUND: It remains controversial whether modified radical neck
  dissection (MRND) for patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma improves
  prognosis. However, it is highly probable that the incidence of local
  recurrence is reduced by lymph node dissection. Sentinel lymph node (SLN)
  biopsy (SLNB) for patients with melanoma and breast carcinoma has been
  validated as an accurate method for assessing lymph node status. The objective
  of this study was to determine the feasibility of SLNB for the evaluation of
  cervical lymph node status in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma.
  METHODS: After injection of methylene blue around the tumor in 22 patients with
  papillary thyroid carcinoma, blue-stained lymph nodes were dissected as SLNs.
  After the SLNB, all patients also underwent subtotal thyroidectomy and MRND.
  SLNs and other lymph nodes were investigated with regard to their number,
  distribution, size, lymph node status, and ratio of metastatic area. RESULTS:
  There was concordance between the SLN findings and the regional lymph node
  status in 19 of 21 patients (90.5%; 7 patients had both positive SLN and
  regional lymph node results, and 12 patients had both negative SLN and regional
  lymph node results). Two patients had negative SLN results but, in the end, had
  positive nonsentinel lymph nodes (NSLNs). The overall reliability rate of SLNB
  was 86.3% (19 of 22 patients). The authors experienced no complications with
  the use of methylene blue for the detection of SLNs. CONCLUSIONS: SLNB using
  methylene blue is feasible technically and is safe, and the findings correlate
  with cervical lymph node status. Therefore, SLNB is a good technique for
  estimating the status of cervical lymph nodes in patients with papillary
  thyroid carcinoma.

  generated much attention. Pitfalls in the pathologic handling of sentinel lymph
  node specimens have received little attention. We report a case in which a
  false-positive diagnosis might have been rendered on a sentinel lymph node
  because of an inadvertent immunostaining error. Attention was drawn to the
  problem by an unusual pattern of distribution of immunoreactive cells-which
  proved to be plasma cells rather than metastatic carcinoma cells.

AB: The flavivirus Iguape was isolated for the first time in 1979, from a
  sentinel mouse exposed in a forested area in Iguape County - SP, Brazil.
  Monotypic hemagglutination inhibition antibodies for Iguape virus were detected
  in domestic and sylvan animals, in Ribeira Valley region, Sao Paulo State.
  Monotypic antibodies have also been detected in human sera, although there is
  no evidence of clinical disease. The authors report the isolation of a new
  strain of Iguape virus from naturally infected mosquitoes. The study was
  conducted in May, 1994 in Juquitiba County - Sao Paulo State, in a forested
  area. Mosquitoes were captured by light traps After systematics identification,
  pools of mosquitoes were processed for virus isolation in suckling mice. An
  isolate (SPAr-158482) was obtained from Anopheles (Kerteszia) cruzii. Tests of
  Hemagglutination, Hemagglutination Inhibition, Complement Fixation,
  Neutralization in suckling mice and sensitivity to Sodium Deoxycholate were
  employed for identification of the isolate. According to tests of Complement
  Fixation, Hemagglutination Inhibition and Neutralization in mice, the virus was
  identified as the same as Iguape virus. This finding suggests that this species
  of mosquito may play a role in the transmission cycle of Iguape virus in
  natural environment.

AB: Sentinel lymph nodes are the first draining nodes that contain tumor cells.
  Identification of sentinel nodes may help to determine the suitable extent of
  lymphadenectoy. To assess the location of sentinel lymph nodes, a series of 41
  patients with single and two metastatic lymph nodes who underwent esophagectomy
  and 3-field lymphadenectomy between 1991 and 1999 were investigated
  retrospectively. Only 29 (47.5%) of 61 metastatic nodes showed correspondence
  between the tumor site and the regional metastatic lymph nodes by routine
  histologic examination. In the patients with tumors in the upper and middle
  thoracic esophagus, metastatic lymph nodes were distributed in the cervix,
  mediastinum and abdomen. Although sentinel nodes were limited to the regional
  and adjusting compartments in 82%, nodes were found beyond the adjusting
  compartments in 18%. The sentinel nodes were broadly distributed depending on
  the location of the tumor in esophageal cancer.

AB: This paper documents the validation of a quality of life scale (QOL)
  designed to assess the impact of arm morbidity on patients following breast
  cancer surgery. A four item arm subscale was developed to supplement a multi
  -dimensional, validated breast cancer QOL tool, the functional assessment of
  cancer therapy (FACT-B.) The new questionnaire, the FACT-B+4, was validated on
  279 women participating in a trial of sentinel node guided axillary therapy and
  29 women attending a lymphoedema clinic. The subscale demonstrated good
  internal consistency (alpha co-efficient=0.62 to 0.88) and stability (test
  -retest reliability=0.97). Lymphoedema patients reported significantly greater
  arm problems than a matched sample of pre-operative trial participants. The
  lymphoedema group also scored lower than trial patients on the FACT-B+4
  indicating a poorer quality of life (p<0.05). A subset of 66 trial patients who
  had completed three consecutive assessments was used to evaluate the
  sensitivity of the questionnaire to change over time. Scores on the FACT-B+4
  were found to decline significantly between the pre-operative assessment and
  post-operative assessment at 1 month. Arm problems significantly increased
  during this period. FACT-B+4 score increased again from 1 month to 12 weeks
  post-surgery and symptoms reduced, as the extent of arm morbidity resolved. The
  FACT-B+4 appears to be psychometrically robust and sensitive to patient
  rehabilitation, making it suitable for use in longitudinal surgical trials.
  Given the dearth of existing scales available to measure arm morbidity, we hope
  this new tool will prove useful to researchers.

AB: Environmental contamination resulting from the Chornobyl, Ukraine, disaster
  offers a unique opportunity to examine the in vivo biological effects of
  chronic, low-dose exposure to radiation. Laboratory studies of acute exposure
  to ionizing radiation have been used to estimate risk and potential human
  health effects by the extrapolation of laboratory data to situations of low
  -dose environmental radiation exposure. Few studies, however, have explored the
  biological consequences of low-dose exposure via in situ environmental
  radiation in a sentinel species. In the present study, laboratory strains of
  Mus musculus (BALB/c and 57BL/6) were placed in environmental enclosures in the
  Red Forest region of the Chornobyl exclusion zone. Blood samples were obtained
  every 10 d, and the micronucleus (MN) test was employed to assess the potential
  for cytogenetic damage from exposure to Chornobyl radiation. Radionuclide
  uptake was monitored throughout the study, and dose was estimated for each
  individual as well as for their offspring. Total dose for the mice
  experimentally exposed to this environment averaged 1162 mGy for BALB/c (30 d)
  and 1629 mGy for C57BL/6 (40 d). A higher MN frequency for both strains was
  observed at day 10, although this change was only statistically significant in
  the C57BL/6 mice (chi2/3 = 13.41, p = 0.003). Subsequent samples from C57BL/6
  resulted in values at or less than the initial frequencies. In BALB/c mice, an
  increase in MN was also evident at day 30 (chi2/2 = 10.38, p = 0.006). The
  experimental design employed here allows for the incorporation of traditional
  laboratory strains, as well as transgenic strains of Mus, as sentinels of
  environmental radiation contamination.

AB: Wastewater reuse raises the question of health risk and the epidemiological
  surveys needed. An epidemiological and environmental approach was used to check
  the security for the exposed populations (surrounding and agricultural
  population in Clermont-Ferrand. Four information systems were set up: two
  sentinel systems joining general physicians (15) and pharmacists (7) for the
  surrounding population and two follow-up surveys among field workers and
  farmers. Water quality monitoring and a study of aerosols from spray irrigation
  were performed. No epidemic event was identified with only some case clusters
  (not related to water exposure) being observed. All the declared cases were
  benign. The workers' survey underlined a substantial incidence of nettle
  rashes, itchy skins, sunburns, and cuts. The follow-up study among farmers and
  their families did not reveal any particular phenomena. The bacteriological
  quality of treated wastewater throughout conformed with the recommendations of
  the Superior Council of Public Health of France (1,000 faecal coliforms/100
  mL). No faecal bacteria were observed in aerosols with water concentrations
  equal to 103 cfu/100mL and an exposure time of 20 min. The survey of such an
  irrigation system, towards potential and actual risks, required the conjunction
  of different epidemiological information sources and microbiological data.

AB: Objective. To determine the effectiveness of intraoperative lymphatic with
  blue dye alone as a means of localizing sentinel nodes in patients with vulvar
  cancer. Methods. All patients undergoing primary surgical treatment for vulvar
  cancer were eligible for this prospective study. Isosulfan blue dye was
  injected intradermally at the edge of the primary tumor closest to the adjacent
  groin. Bilateral dye injections and groin dissections were performed if the
  tumor was within 2 cm of the midline. Results. Fifty-two patients were enrolled
  in the study between 1993 and 1999. The median age was 58 years. Eighty-seven
  percent of the patients had T1 or T2 lesions, and 92% had nonsuspicious lymph
  nodes on palpation. Sixty-seven percent of the patients had squamous cell
  carcinoma; the remaining patients had melanoma or adenocarcinoma. The sentinel
  node was identified in 46 of the 52 patients (88%), comprising 22 of the 25
  patients with lateral tumors and 24 of the 27 patients with midline lesions.
  The sentinel node was successfully identified in 57 of the 76 (75%) dissected
  groins. Sentinel node identification in the groin was hampered by the effects
  of prior excisional biopsy vs punch biopsy (11 of 25 vs 8 of 51, P = 0.007) and
  by the lateral vs midline location of the tumor (22 of 25 groins vs 35 of 51
  groins, P = 0.067). During the first 2 years (1993-1994), a sentinel node could
  not be identified in 4 of the 25 (16%) patients and 13 of the 36 (36%) groins
  dissected, compared with 2 of the 27 (7%) of patients treated and 6 of the 40
  (15%) groins dissected from 1995 through 1999 (P = 0.034). A total of 556 nodes
  were removed (median, 7 per groin), of which 83 (median, 1 per groin) were
  sentinel. The sentinel node was not identified in 2 of the 12 groins that
  proved to have metastatic disease. Both events occurred in the first 2 years of
  the study. There were no false-negative sentinel nodes. Since 1995, we have
  successfully identified the sentinel node in 16 of the 16 patients (25 of 25
  groins) with T1 or T2 primary lesions, squamous histology, and nonsuspicious
  groin nodes on physical examination. Conclusions. Experience and careful
  patient selection can permit sentinel node identification with blue dye
  injection alone in more than 95% of patients with vulvar cancer.

AB: Several lines of evidence implicate the area postrema (AP) in immunosensory
  signaling. Populations of immune cells, intermingled among the neurons, are
  capable of detecting circulating immune stimuli. These immune cells express a
  morphology consistent with dendritic cells, which are recognized to function as
  immune sentinels. To provide anatomical support for a potential influence of
  these immune cells on autonomic functions mediated by the area postrema, we
  investigated structural relationships between putative dendritic cells
  (expressing MHC-II molecules) and neurons in the area postrema that express
  tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity (TH-IR), which likely function as output
  neurons. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized and perfused transcardially
  with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. The brainstems, containing the
  area postrema, were sectioned at 50 microns on a vibratome, and processed for
  double-label immunohistochemistry directed toward TH and MHC-II (OX-6). OX6
  -positive immune cells appeared to contact specific TH-IR neurons. These immune
  cells were characterized by large cell bodies and prominent branching
  processes, consistent with a dendritic cell phenotype. The branches of these
  cells evinced a very close association with, and even appeared to contact, the
  processes and cell bodies of TH-IR neurons. These findings support a role for
  the area postrema in the integration of circulating and neurally mediated
  immune information. The close association of immune sentinel cells and neurons
  within this structure may provide a novel mechanism for fine tuning the brain's
  response to infection.

AB: Objective: To assess drug use and the incidence of mild to moderate adverse
  drug effects (AE) in children aged 0-16 years, with 2 different approaches.
  Methods: All 185 pediatric practices in the State of Brandenburg, Germany, were
  surveyed (95% positive response). A random sample of 50 practices servicing
  36,000 children participated in the study as sentinel physicians reporting any
  AE among their patients. Twenty practices servicing 14,000 children were
  included in a drug utilization component (DUC) which documented diagnoses,
  prescribing and AE in all children seen in a 3-month period. Results: The
  results on the DUC are based on 12,628 children with 26,168 physician contacts,
  34,465 diagnoses and 33,140 drug prescriptions given to 85% of the children
  seen (average age: 6.7 years). Practice size ranged from 94 to 1473 children
  seen in a 3-month period. The average number of physician contacts per child
  was 2.1, with 10% seeing a physician 5 times and more. The diagnoses were
  respiratory ailments (30%), skin- (12%), injection- (11%) and trauma- (10%)
  related diagnoses. Major drug uses were respiratory (34% of prescriptions),
  anti-infective (22%), dermatological (13%), gastrointestinal (9%) and
  psychotropic agents (8%). One hundred and fifty-two AE affecting 150 children
  were documented in the DUC, 60% of these occurring within 3 days after
  treatment initiation. 83% of AE were mild (up to 4 on a scale from 1-6), and
  85% were considered by physicians to be attributable. Only 4 reports of very
  severe events were received. 47% of reports were related to antibiotic uses,
  31% to immunizations, 11% to respiratory, and 4% to gastrointestinal agents.
  While there are no differences in the occurrence of AE by gender, AE decreases
  significantly by age, maintaining the same patterns of AE type and causative
  medication. Over a 3-month period, the incidence of mild to moderate ADR in
  children given medications is estimated as 1,200 per 100,000, or about 1%.
  Conclusions: Under-reporting of AE remains an issue even when a monitoring
  scheme suggests compliance. The results of this study show that while AE in
  children are generally non-serious, 1% of treatments might elicit mild AE
  leading to a consultation. Direct practice recording produces more reports than
  a sentinel system.

AB: Sentinel node scintigraphy in tumours of the head and neck region was
  combined with bone scintigraphy to provide anatomical landmarks in order to
  better locate the lymph node uptake. 99Tcm-nanocolloid (40 MBq) was injected in
  the peritumour region 1 h after the administration of bone-seeking 99Tcm
  -methylene diphosphonate (200 MBq). After 5 min, A-P and lateral projections of
  the head and neck region were acquired. In all the 26 patients examined, the
  surrounding anatomy was clearly depicted. In 23 patients, the lymphatic
  drainage was identified within 30 min. In these patients, all hot spots
  appearing outside the deposited activity could be located according to the neck
  region classification system of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital. No
  lymphatic drainage was visualized in the remaining three patients. The
  injection of bone-seeking activity 1 h before deposition of the radiocolloid
  provided images visualizing soft tissues as well as skeletal structures, thus
  improving the topical diagnosis. Correlation with the results of surgery was
  not performed. The administration of a small amount of bone-seeking activity
  prior to sentinel node scintigraphy of head and neck tumours improves the
  anatomical localization of the lymph node activity.

AB: The status of the homolateral axillary lymph nodes is still the most
  important prognostic factor in early stage breast cancer. The information
  obtained from the pathological examination of the lymph nodes guides is of
  critical importance in the decision process regarding the use of postoperative
  adjuvant therapy. However, lymph node axillary dissection can be followed by
  significant locoregional morbidity. The sentinel lymph node (SLN) technique was
  developed as a means of avoiding the full exploration of the axilla and
  consists in the identification of the first lymph node in the lymphatic
  drainage system of the breast tumour in the homolateral axilla. It has been
  demonstrated that the status of the SLN is highly predictive for the presence
  or absence of tumour involvement in the remaining lymph nodes in the axilla. In
  this study we evaluated the SLN technique using both 99mTc labelled dextran 500
  and patent blue V dye in relation to the classical lymph node resection a
  series of 56 women with early breast cancer who attended the Breast Unit of the
  Academic Hospital of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. To
  our knowledge this is the first report in the literature of the utilization of
  99mTc dextran 500 for the SLN technique. As there are no similar commercially
  available dedicated radiopharmaceuticals labelled for use in lymphoscintigraphy
  studies, we report on an effective method to label dextran 500 with 99mTc which
  proved to be simple, inexpensive and yielded similar results for SLN
  identification compared with those given in the literature. The median age of
  the patients was 57 years (range 32-82 years). Seventeen patients were age 50
  years or less, and 39 patients were older than 50 years. The median tumour size
  was 2.0 cm (range 0.8-7.0 cm). The mapping of the SLN was possible in all cases
  during the transoperative period by using a hand-guided gamma probe and a blue
  dye. A median of 2.0 (range 1-5) SLN were excised per patient. The median of
  axillary lymph nodes excised per patient was 21 (range 10-36). The calculated
  sensitivity and specificity of the method were 95.6% and 100%, respectively.
  The negative predictive value and overall accuracy were 97% and 98.2%,
  respectively. In conclusion, the SLN technique was feasible and produced
  similar positive results as previously reported in the literature.

AB: Many countries are currently studying the possibility of mass vaccination
  against varicella. The objective of this study was to provide a comprehensive
  picture of the pre-vaccine epidemiology of the varicella zoster virus (VZV) to
  aid in the design of immunization programs and to adequately measure the impact
  of vaccination. Population-based data including physician visit claims,
  sentinel surveillance and hospitalization data from Canada and the United
  Kingdom were analysed. The key epidemiological characteristics of varicella and
  zoster (age specific consultation rates, seasonality, force of infection,
  hospitalization rates and inpatient days) were compared. Results show that the
  overall epidemiology of varicella and zoster is remarkably similar between the
  two countries. The major difference being that, contrary to Canada, the
  epidemiology of varicella seems to be changing in the United Kingdom with an
  important decrease in the average age at infection that coincides with a
  significant increase in children attending preschool. Furthermore, differences
  exist in the seasonality between the United Kingdom and Canada, which seem to
  be primarily due to the school calendar. These results illustrate that school
  and preschool contact patterns play an important role in the dynamics of
  varicella. Finally, our results provide baseline estimates of varicella and
  zoster incidence and morbidity for VZV vaccine effectiveness and cost
  -effectiveness studies.

AB: Eel Anguilla anguilla plasma vitellogenin was investigated as a biomarker of
  exposure to environmental compounds with estrogenic activity, along the tidal
  course of the Thames Estuary, UK. A. anguilla was chosen as a sentinel species
  because of their wide distribution, robustness in field and laboratory studies
  and also because they have a characterised normal 'intersex' condition where
  the gonad contains both developing male and female gonadal cells termed a
  Syrski organ. Following laboratory exposure to 17beta-estradiol
  (intraperitoneal injection), a plasma protein (approx. 211 kDa apparent
  molecular weight) was detected by monoclonal antibodies to vitellogenin of
  striped bass (Morone saxatilis). Western and dot blot analyses were developed
  and vitellogenin was isolated from 17beta-estradiol-treated fish to calibrate
  the quantification of the blots by image analysis. The limits of sensitivity
  for the Western and dot blots were 100 and 10 ng vitellogenin/ml, respectively.
  Levels of vitellogenin in Thames estuary samples were below the detection
  limits of the Western but not the dot blot, and showed no statistically
  significant site-specific (10 sites) and seasonal-specific (May, August,
  November) differences. Values were observed to be low, between 11 and 165
  ng/ml, compared with 17-50 mg/ml for 17beta-estradiol-treated eels. Similar low
  levels of plasma vitellogenin were determined in fish sampled along the Tyne,
  Wear, Tees or Humber estuaries, or the Weston canal Liverpool, with mean plasma
  vitellogenin levels varying between 44 and 82 ng/ml. These levels of
  vitellogenin in A. anguilla plasma were observed to be consistent with the
  known biology of the eel. Immature females, or fish with syrski organs,
  reported both lower levels and smaller variation of plasma vitellogenin
  concentrations whereas the highest plasma vitellogenin concentrations were
  determined in fish above 45 cm consistent with female fish. These results
  indicate inter-species variation between the plasma vitellogenin concentrations
  of A. anguilla and other published fish studies undertaken along the same
  estuaries.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of using complementary techniques for
  detecting sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in vulvar carcinoma and to evaluate the
  utility of microstaging techniques. STUDY DESIGN: Patients with invasive vulvar
  carcinoma underwent sentinel lymph node detection (SLND) using preoperative
  lymphoscintigraphy, intraoperative isosulfan blue dye injection and an
  intraoperative hand-held gamma-detecting probe. Eleven patients were included
  and a total of 16 groins evaluated. Sentinel nodes identified were excised,
  bisected and examined in surgical pathology using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
  staining. Pathologically negative SLNs were subjected to additional
  microstaging via serial sectioning and immunohistochemical staining for
  cytokeratin. Surgical management of the vulvar cancer and extent of inguinal
  -femoral lymphadenectomy were individualized based on clinico-pathologic
  parameters, including depth of invasion, location of the tumor and patient
  performance status. RESULTS: Lymphoscintigraphy, dye and gamma-detector methods
  led to the total detection of 16, 19 and 17 SLNs, respectively. In two cases
  the isosulfan blue dye assisted in the isolation of an additional sentinel node
  over that of the gamma probe. Each method individually identified SLNs in 10/11
  patients (91%). A total of 19 sentinel nodes were isolated. One SLN (5%) was
  positive for metastatic disease using H&E staining. Of the 18 negative SLNs, 2
  (11%) had micrometastases (<0.2 mm) upon serial sectioning and
  immunohistochemical staining. CONCLUSION: Combined-modality mapping enhances
  detection of SLNs in vulvar carcinoma. Histologic microstaging improves the
  detection of micrometastases within SLNs.

AB: Purpose: To evaluate the volume of nodal irradiation associated with breast
  -conserving therapy, we defined the anatomic relationship of sentinel lymph
  nodes and axillary level I and II lymph nodes in patients receiving tangential
  breast irradiation. Methods and Materials: A retrospective analysis of 65
  simulation fields in women with breast cancer treated with sentinel lymph node
  surgery and 39 women in whom radiopaque clips demarcated the extent of axillary
  lymph node dissection was performed. We measured the relationship of the
  surgical clips to the anatomic landmarks and calculated the percentage of
  prescribed dose delivered to the sentinel lymph node region. Results: A cranial
  field edge 2.0 cm below the humeral head the sentinel lymph node region was
  included or at the field edge in 95% of the cases and the entire extent of
  axillary I and II dissection in 43% of the axillary dissection cases. In the
  remaining 57%, this field border encompassed an average of 80% of
  cranial/caudal extent of axillary level I and II dissection. In 98.5% of the
  cases, all sentinel lymph nodes were anterior to the deep field edge and 71%
  were anterior to the chest wall-interface, whereas 61% of the axillary
  dissection cohort had extension deep to the chest wall-lung interface. If the
  deep field edge had been set 2 cm below the chest wall-lung interface, the
  entire axillary dissection would have been included in 82% of the cases, and
  the entire sentinel lymph node would have been covered with a 0.5-cm margin.
  The median dose to the sentinel lymph node region was 98% of the prescribed
  dose. Conclusions: By extending the cranial border to 2 cm below the humeral
  head and 2 cm deep to the chest wall-lung interface, the radiotherapy fields
  used to treat the breast can include the sentinel lymph node region and most of
  axillary levels I and II.

AB: The biokinetics of Cs in four compartments in the green-lipped mussel Perna
  viridis, namely, gill, viscera, adductor muscle, and foot, were studied. First
  -order linear differential equations were set up for these four compartments,
  and their solutions were used to fit the experimental data. The parameters
  governing the biokinetics, which depend on the elimination rate from each
  compartment and the transfer coefficient between compartments, were found.
  These are useful in understanding the physiology of Perna viridis, in
  predicting the activity of cesium in each compartment of Perna viridis from a
  contamination history, or in using Perna viridis as a sentinel organism for
  surveying and monitoring radioactive contamination. The results showed that the
  viscera should be represented by more than one compartment. Concentration
  factors for the four compartments and for Perna viridis were also determined,
  and these agreed well with reported values in the literature.

AB: Purpose: The localization of lymph node metastases in prostate cancer varies
  enormously. Due to high morbidity complete pelvic lymphadenectomy is often
  decreased to modified staging lymphadenectomy, resulting in loss of sensitivity
  for detecting micrometastases. Based on the promising results of intraoperative
  gamma probe application for identifying sentinel lymph nodes in malignant
  melanoma, breast and penis cancer, we identified sentinel lymph nodes in
  prostate cancer using a comparable technique. Materials and Methods: In 117
  patients 99mtechnetium nanocolloid was transrectally injected directly into the
  prostate under ultrasound guidance 1 day before pelvic lymphadenectomy.
  Thereafter dynamic lymphoscintigraphy was done. Initially lymph nodes
  identified as sentinel lymph nodes by the gamma probe were removed and
  subsequently modified pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed. Results: Lymphatic
  metastasis was detected in 28 cases. An average of 4 sentinel lymph nodes were
  identified per patient in 25 of 27 patients with micrometastasis, of which
  those in 24 contained micrometastasis for 96% sensitivity. In contrast,
  sensitivity of modified pelvic lymphadenectomy was 81.5%. In 16 patients only
  sentinel lymph nodes were positive. An average of 21.8 lymph nodes (range 10 to
  51) was dissected per patient at pelvic lymphadenectomy. Lymph node metastasis
  was noted in 6 of the 46 patients with a prostate specific antigen between 4
  and 10 ng./ml. and in 8 of the 64 with a stage pT2 tumor. Conclusions: Our
  study shows individual variability of lymphatic drainage of the prostate and
  limited sensitivity for detecting positive lymph nodes when the pelvic
  dissection area is limited. Furthermore, our experience implies that the
  identification of sentinel lymph nodes is feasible, not only in breast cancer
  and malignant melanoma, but also in prostate cancer using a comparable
  technique.

AB: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in breast cancer is considered in order to
  spare node-negative patients from axillary lymph node dissection. To assess the
  clinical significance of lymphoscintigraphic mapping in SLNB, we analyzed the
  lymphatic drain to the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in terms of the pattern and
  direction of the hot spot. Twenty-three breast cancer patients were enrolled
  for SLNB. Before surgery, lymphoscintigraphic mapping of SLN was performed
  using Tc-99m human serum albumin (HSA) and tin colloids, and the hot spot was
  marked. The Tc-99m HSA and tin colloids were subcutaneously injected above the
  tumor and peritumor sites, respectively, and lymphoscintigraphic scanning was
  monitored every 5 to 10 min, for up to 2 h after injection. The SLN was
  identified using a combination of a blue dye, indigocalmine, and a gamma probe
  during surgery. The hot spot pattern and direction of the lymphatic drains were
  evaluated in 21 of 23 cases. Two cases did not have a hot spot. Single, double,
  and multiple hot spots were observed in 12 cases (52.1%), 8 cases (34.7%), and
  1 case (4.3%), respectively. The positions of the hot spots were: axillary
  (n=17, 80.9%), axillary and sternal (n=3, 14.2%), and phrenic (n=1, 4.7%). The
  sensitivity and specificity rates in SLNB were 66.6% and 100%, respectively,
  and the overall predictive rate was 85.7%. Lymphoscintigraphy produced false
  negatives in three cases (33.3%), including one on the phrenic side.
  Lymphoscintigraphic mapping with Tc-99m HSA and tin colloids is useful for
  determining the SLN, and avoiding a false negative. The pattern and direction
  of the lymphatic drain to the SLN in scintigraphy need to be considered for the
  elimination of axillary lymph node dissection in node-negative patients with
  breast cancer.

AB: BACKGROUND: The authors performed a pilot trial of ultrasound-guided
  percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in patients with T1 and T2 breast
  tumors 1) to confirm complete coagulative necrosis of tumor tissue and 2) to
  determine the safety and complications related to this treatment. METHODS:
  Twenty-six patients with biopsy-proven, invasive breast carcinoma underwent RFA
  of their breast tumors followed by immediate resection. Treatment was planned
  to ablate the tumor and a 5 mm margin of surrounding breast tissue. Tumor
  viability after RFA was assessed by hematoxylin and eosin and nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide vital staining. RESULTS: Twenty patients (77%) had T1
  tumors, and six patients (23%) had T2 tumors. The mean greatest dimension of
  tumors that were treated with RFA was 1.8 cm (range, 0.7-3.0 cm). The mean
  treatment time for two-phase RFA treatment was 15 minutes and 23 seconds
  (range, from 6 minutes and 25 seconds to 24 minutes and 54 seconds).
  Coagulation necrosis of the tumor was complete in 25 of 26 patients (96%): One
  patient had a microscopic focus of viable tissue adjacent to the needle shaft
  site. A single patient (1 of 26 patients; 4%) had a complication related to
  RFA: a full thickness burn of the skin overlying a tumor that was immediately
  beneath the skin. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot experience with RFA in the treatment
  of patients with early-stage, primary breast carcinoma revealed that 1)
  coagulative necrosis of the entire tumor occurred in 96% of the patients, and
  2) the treatment was safe, with only a 4% complication rate. The authors have
  initiated a trial of RFA alone (no resection) for patients with T1 and T2
  breast tumors that will include sentinel lymph node mapping and postablation
  irradiation.

AB: BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping and biopsy is emerging as an
  alternative to axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in determining the lymph
  node status of patients with early-stage breast carcinoma. The hypothesis of
  the technique is that the SLN is the first lymph node in the regional lymphatic
  basin that drains the primary tumor. Non-SLN (NSLN) metastasis in the axilla is
  unlikely if the axillary SLN shows no tumor involvement, and, thus, further
  axillary interference may be avoided. However, the optimal treatment of the
  axilla in which an SLN metastasis is found requires ongoing evaluation. The
  objectives of this study were to evaluate the predictors for NSLN metastasis in
  the presence of a tumor-involved axillary SLN and to examine the treatment
  implications for patients with early-stage breast carcinoma. METHODS: Between
  June 1998 and May 2000, 167 patients participated in the pilot study of SLN
  mapping and biopsy at Westmead Hospital. SLNs were identified successfully and
  biopsied in 140 axillae. All study patients also underwent ALND. The incidence
  of NSLN metastasis in the 51 patients with a SLN metastasis was correlated with
  clinical and pathologic characteristics. RESULTS: Of 51 patients with a
  positive SLN, 24 patients (47%) had NSLN metastases. The primary tumor size was
  the only significant predictor for NSLN involvement. NSLN metastasis occurred
  in 25% of patients (95% confidence interval (95%CI), 10-47%) with a primary
  tumor size ltoreq20 mm and in 67% of patients (95%CI, 46-83%) with a primary
  tumor size >20 mm (P=0.005). The size of the SLN metastasis was not associated
  significantly with NSLN involvement. Three of 7 patients (43%) with an SLN
  micrometastasis (<1 mm) had NSLN involvement compared with 38 of 44 patients
  (48%) with an SLN macrometastasis (gtoreq1 mm). CONCLUSIONS: The current study
  did not identify a subgroup of SLN positive patients in whom the incidence of
  NSLN involvement was low enough to warrant no further axillary interference. At
  present, a full axillary dissection should be performed in patients with a
  positive SLN.

AB: Objectives: To estimate HIV incidence, characterize correlates of HIV
  seroconversion, and monitor temporal trends in HIV transmission among patients
  repeatedly tested for HIV by a county hospital in San Francisco. Design:
  Retrospective longitudinal study. Methods: HIV incidence was retrospectively
  calculated among persons voluntarily tested for HIV antibody more than once at
  San Francisco's county hospital or one of its affiliated satellite community
  clinics between 1993 and 1999. Linkage of HIV test results in computerized
  databases identified "seroconverters" as individuals who had a negative
  antibody test followed by a positive test. The interval between tests was used
  as the person-time at risk. Cox proportional hazards analysis identified
  correlates of HIV seroconversion. Results: A total of 84 HIV seroconversions
  were identified among 2893 eligible patients repeatedly tested for HIV antibody
  over a cumulative 5860 person-years (PYs) (incidence of 1.4 per 100 PYs, 95%
  confidence interval (CI): 1.2-1.7). The majority of seroconversions (71
  (84.5%)) were among injection drug users (IDUs) (incidence of 2.0 per 100 PYs,
  CI: 1.6-2.4). HIV incidence was highest among men who have sex with men (MSM)
  who were also IDUs (incidence of 3.8 per 100 PYs, CI: 2.7-5.1) and lowest among
  non-IDUs, heterosexual men, and non-IDU women (incidence of 0.3 per 100 PYs,
  CI: 0.1-0.6). In multivariate analysis, correlates of HIV seroconversion were
  age 25 to 29 years (hazard ratio (HR)=3.9, CI: 2.4-6.3), MSM (HR=2.9, CI: 1.9
  -4.4), and IDU (HR=3.2, CI: 1.8-5.8). Overall, no temporal trend in annual HIV
  incidence was noted during the study period; however, HIV incidence among MSM
  IDUs increased from 2.9 per 100 PYs in 1996 to 4.7 per 100 PYs in 1998.
  Conclusions: The rate of seroconversion in this hospital and affiliated clinic
  population is unexpectedly high. Moreover, HIV transmission among IDU patients
  has not decreased over the last several years. The San Francisco county
  hospital provides a high-risk sentinel population to monitor emerging trends in
  HIV transmission, especially among IDUs, and presents multiple opportunities
  for prevention interventions, because these patients are being seen repeatedly
  by clinicians.

AB: Objective: To detect the micrometastasis of pan-axillary lymph nodes by
  serial section of negative sentinel lymph node biopsy can be a more accurate
  reference for treatment. Methods: Blue dye (1% Patented Blue) was used in 52
  cases. Serial section of all the negative SLN was performed. Results: SLN was
  detected in 44 of 52 cases (84.6%). The detected rate of SLN was associated
  with the site of tumor (P<0.01). The SLN was positive in 13 cases and negative
  in 31 cases by routine pathologic examination. The "Jumping metastasis"
  occurred in two of 31 SLN negative cases. The overall accordance rate was 95.5%
  and false negative rate 13.3%. Serial section was performed in 31 SLN negative
  cases, and metastasis was found in 3 of 29 cases who had no "Jumping
  metastasis", and the false negative rate of the latter reduced to 11.1%.
  Conclusion: SLN biopsy is of some value to assess the axillary lymph node
  status in breast and can be regarded as a reference of treatment. Presence of
  false negative is the main problem of SLN biopsy. Serial section,
  immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR can increase the reliability of SLN biopsy.

  sparrows, swallows, and starlings and from sentinel ducks placed next to turkey
  farms experiencing avian pneumovirus (APV) infections and were analyzed for APV
  genome and infectious particles. APV RNA was detected in samples examined from
  geese, sparrows, and starlings. APV RNA and antibodies were also detected in
  two different groups of sentinel ducks. Infectious APV was recovered from
  sentinel duck samples. The APV M gene isolated from the wild birds had over 96%
  predicted amino acid identity with APV/Minnesota 2A, which was isolated earlier
  from domestic turkeys showing respiratory illness, suggesting that wild birds
  may be involved in spreading APV infection.

AB: Immune factors secreted in milk are important for health in the neonatal
  gut. We have detected the bacterial pattern recognition receptor, soluble CD14
  (sCD14) in human breast milk at different times during lactation. The molecule
  occurs in a single form in milk, in contrast to human serum, in which there are
  two isoforms. Produced by mammary epithelial cells, milk sCD14 mediates
  secretion of innate immune response molecules such as interleukin-8, tumor
  necrosis factor-alpha, and epithelial neutrophil activator-78 by CD14-negative
  intestinal epithelial cells exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or bacteria.
  Although present at low concentrations in milk, LPS-binding protein may be
  implicated in the biological effects observed. Our findings support the premise
  that milk sCD14 acts as a 'sentinel' molecule and immune modulator in
  homeostasis and in the defense of the neonatal intestine. In so doing, it may
  prevent the immune and inflammatory conditions of the gut to which non
  -breastfed infants are predisposed.

AB: In order to use a sentinel organism to monitor hazardous trace metals in the
  marine environment, a reliable analytical procedure for the determination of
  trace metal concentrations in biological samples is necessary. A critical step
  of the trace metal determination is a sample digestion to solubilize metals. In
  order to develop a simple method of sample digestion using a commercially
  available laboratory microwave equipment, an acid combination (HNO3 and H2SO4)
  and microwave power-time program were examined with respect to recovery of
  reference materials. Using 1 g of reference material with 5 mL of nitric acid
  and 1 mL of sulfuric acid, Mn, Cd, Cu, Ni, Se, As, Sr and Zn were properly
  analyzed yielding the certified values within the analytical uncertainties, but
  Pb yielded a slightly higher values. The detection limit was 0.1, 0.1, 0.5,
  0.5, 1, 0.7, 1, 0.2 and 1 ppm for Mn, Cd, Cu, Ni, Se, As, Zn, Sr and Pb,
  respectively. This method was successfully applied to natural oysters and blue
  mussels collected from Tokyo Bay and Aburatsubo Bay.

AB: The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy and
  feasibility of sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection using a gamma probe in
  patients with Figo IB cervical cancer. Between January 1999 and September 2000,
  14 patients with cervical cancer, planned for radical hysterectomy were
  eligible for the study. The day before radical hysterectomy we injected
  technetium99m-labelled nanocolloid in each quadrant of the cervix. Dynamic and
  static images were recorded using a gamma camera. SLNs were identified
  intraoperatively using a handheld gamma-detection probe. After resection of
  SLNs a standard radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection was
  performed. Patients and tumour characteristics were compared with sentinel node
  detection and with final histopathological and immunohistochemical results.
  Scintigraphy showed focal uptake in 13 of the 14 patients. Intraoperatively we
  detected 26 sentinel nodes by gamma probe. In 8 of 13 patients, one or more
  sentinel nodes were identified unilaterally, in 5 women bilaterally.
  Histologically positive SLNs were found in only 1 patient. We did not find any
  false-negative SLN in our series. In conclusion identification of sentinel
  nodes in cervical cancer is feasible with preoperatively administered
  technetium99m-labelled nanocolloid. A larger series will be required to
  establish sentinel node detection in cervical cancer for further therapy
  concepts and planning.

AB: Background: Routine performance of axillary node dissection (AND) in the
  treatment of stage I and II breast cancer has become controversial because of
  pretended morbidity of this procedure and progressing consent for sentinel
  lymphadenectomy. Methods: Ninety-four consecutive patients who underwent AND
  for clinical stage I and II breast cancer were evaluated for a range of 48.3
  months after surgery for movement and sensory alterations and arm swelling. Arm
  circumference was measured in all patients at the same four sites on both the
  operated and non operated sides preoperatively and in the immediate and late
  postoperative course. Capacity for movement was assessed pre- and
  postoperatively as active ranging at the shoulder joint. Postoperative numbness
  and paresthesias were assessed by standard questions. Results: No patient had
  axillary recurrence. None of the detected differences between the preoperative
  and postoperative arm circumferences reached statistical significance. No
  persistent motion limitation was observed. Pain, numbness, paresthesia were
  detected in almost all patients in the immediate postoperative period but
  resolved spontaneously in all cases within 6 months. The obese body habit was
  detected on multivariate analysis as the only significant predictor of edema.
  Conclusions: No significant morbidity and no axillary recurrence were observed
  in current experience to follow AND. These findings suggest that axillary level
  I and II dissection remains an effective and safe tool for diagnostic, as well
  therapeutic, purposes in the treatment of stage I and II breast cancer. Further
  studies are necessary before it can safely be reported that axillary node
  dissection is an optional part of the treatment of stage I and II breast cancer.

AB: BACKGROUND: Immunohistochemical analysis of sentinel lymph nodes from
  patients with breast carcinoma and melanoma has been shown to increase the
  sensitivity for detecting lymph node metastases. To the authors' knowledge,
  this technique has not been described in patients with Merkel cell carcinoma.
  METHODS: Lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed on 26
  patients with Merkel cell carcinoma between 1997 and 1999. All sentinel lymph
  nodes were analyzed with conventional hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and
  then analyzed with immunohistochemical staining to evaluate whether this
  additional technique would increase the number of patients found to have lymph
  node metastasis. RESULTS: The median age of the patients in the current study
  was 67 years and the median tumor size at the time of presentation was 2 cm.
  Lymph node metastases were identified in 5 of the 26 patients (19%). Three of
  these five lymph node positive patients were identified with H&E staining. The
  remaining two patients were identified only after immunohistochemical analysis.
  The median follow-up in this group of lymph node positive patients was 14
  months, with 2 of the 5 lymph node positive patients developing a recurrence.
  The median follow-up in the 21 patients who were lymph node negative was 19
  months, with only 1 patient having developed a recurrence at the time of last
  follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemical analysis of sentinel lymph nodes
  from patients with Merkel cell carcinoma appears to increase the sensitivity of
  detecting clinically occult lymph node metastases.

AB: BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is used increasingly in
  patients with clinically lymph node negative, early-stage breast carcinoma,
  because it can spare axillary dissection when the sentinel lymph nodes are
  negative. The question arises, however, whether complete axillary lymph node
  dissection (ALND) also is necessary in patients with only micrometastases
  (ltoreq2 mm in greatest dimension) in axillary SLNs. The authors carried out
  the current study to ascertain the risk of non-SLN axillary metastases in such
  patients and to assess the detection rate of SLN micrometastases in relation to
  the sectioning interval and the number of sections examined. METHODS: The
  authors examined 109 patients with micrometastatic SLNs from a series of 634
  patients with carcinoma of the breast who underwent SLN biopsy and complete
  ALND as part of the surgical treatment for their disease. The SLNs were
  sectioned completely at 50-mum intervals, and the sections were examined intra
  -operatively. RESULTS: The overall frequency of metastases in axillary non-SLNs
  was 21.8%. The frequency was correlated significantly with the size of the SLN
  micrometastatic focus (P=0.02): 36.4% of patients with foci >1 mm had
  metastases in axillary lymph nodes-a percentage approaching 44.7% of patients
  with macrometastatic SLNs-whereas only 15.6% of patients with micrometastases
  ltoreq1 mm had other involved axillary lymph nodes. CONCLUSIONS: Outside of
  clinical trials, patients with T1 and small T2 breast carcinoma and
  micrometastatic SLNs should undergo complete ALND for adequate staging.
  However, patients with SLN micrometastases up to 1 mm in greatest dimension
  have a significantly lower risk of additional axillary metastases, raising the
  question of whether ALND may be avoided in this subgroup of patients.

AB: Background: To the authors' knowledge, there are no long-term cohort studies
  of lymphedema, despite the substantial morbidity of arm swelling. The goal of
  this study was to identify prevalence of breast carcinoma-related lymphedema,
  time of onset, and associated predictive factors. Methods: A cohort of 923
  women consecutively treated with mastectomy and complete axillary dissection at
  our center between 1976 and 1978 was observed intensively for 20 years. Two
  hundred sixty-three study subjects (28.5%) who were alive and recurrence free
  constituted the cohort for the current study. A subset of 52 women (20% of
  study population) with contralateral mastectomy was analyzed separately.
  Subjects reported circumferential arm measurements taken using a validated
  instrument. In addition to providing analysis of clinical and treatment
  variables, this study is the first to the authors' knowledge to analyze
  possible etiologic factors in the posttreatment years, such as occupation,
  general physical activity, and sports/leisure activities. Univariate and
  multivariate analytic methods were used. Results: At 20 years after treatment,
  49% (128 of 263) reported the sensation of lymphedema. Arm swelling
  measurements were severe (gtoreq2.0 in (5.08 cm); patients reported measurement
  in inches) for 13% (33 of 263 women). Seventy-seven percent (98 of 128) noted
  onset within 3 years after the operation; the remaining percentage developed
  arm swelling at a rate of almost 1% per year. Of the 15 potential predictive
  factors analyzed, only 2 were statistically significantly associated with
  lymphedema: arm infection/injury and weight gain since operation (P<0.001 and
  P=0.02, respectively). Conclusions: This defined cohort, treated by axillary
  dissection 20 years ago, documents the high prevalence of lymphedema and its
  time course. Two significantly associated factors, both potentially
  controllable, are identified. The current study provides further support for
  treatments that limit lymph node dissection. The authors are prospectively
  evaluating patients undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy.

AB: Nine isolates from pigs persistently infected with a recent Italian isolate
  of swine vesicular disease (SVD) virus, ITL/9/93, were collected sequentially
  over 121 days and were characterized antigenically and biochemically. There was
  an accumulation of amino acid (aa) substitutions in the capsid proteins
  throughout the carrier state that could be correlated with alterations in
  antigenicity in virus isolates collected late stage in infection. The aa
  substitutions detected mainly occurred in VP1 and antigenic changes were
  detected in late isolates both at antigenic site 1, resulting in loss of
  binding of Mab 4GO7, and at a closely located site which has not yet been
  named, recognized by Mab C29. In further experiments groups of pigs were
  exposed to a range of SVD viruses, but no virus was isolated beyond 16 days
  post infection (dpi) nor viral RNA detected beyond 42 dpi. Attempts to transfer
  infection to sentinel pigs introduced some time after initial infection of the
  original pigs were largely unsuccessful. The carrier state was established in
  only one out of five experimental infections of pigs with SVD virus and can
  therefore be considered a rare sequel to infection with SVD virus and is of
  limited significance in the epidemiology of the disease.

AB: Declining trends in male proportion at birth observed in several Western
  countries might reflect widespread exposure to pollutants capable of
  interfering with human reproduction. In this study, the authors describe male
  live birth proportion trends in 23 European countries from 1950 to 1996 (total
  of 305 million live births). Overall, there was a significant linearly
  decreasing trend of 10 fewer males per 100,000 births each year, resulting in a
  loss of 73,462 boys during a 47-yr period. The proportion of male births during
  the first 3 yr of the study period was higher than in the last 3 yr in 18
  countries (i.e., 78%). Decreasing trends, which varied in slope and shape, were
  observed in 11 countries; no significant trend was found in 8 countries, and
  male birth proportion increased in 4 countries. The results of this study
  confirmed that the proportion of male births is declining in Europe, and
  differences exist by region and country. Social and cultural aggregations of
  countries with decreasing trends suggest that sociodemographic characteristics
  might be more likely to explain trends than environmental exposures to
  chemicals. Investigators should evaluate this hypothesis to assess the
  usefulness of male birth proportion as a sentinel event.

AB: Two experiments were carried out to identify the target population of cattle
  for immunisation against East Coast fever (ECF) using the infection-and
  -treatment method. Firstly, a sentinel-calf study was used to determine the age
  window for ECF immunisation by determining ages at clinical detection of
  infection with Theileria parva. Six groups of five naive cross-bred (Bos
  taurus/Bos indicus) male calves, introduced at intervals of 2 months at a mean
  age of 26 days, were exposed to natural tick challenge on a high ECF-risk,
  small-holder farm in the coastal lowland, coconut-cassava agro-ecological zone
  of coastal Kenya. Secondly, a challenge study evaluated the relationship
  between the presence of T. parva antibodies and immunity. Ten indigenous adult
  Zebu cattle and nine Zebu young stock purchased from farmers in the same zone,
  and eight cross-bred calves (survivors of the sentinel-calf study) were
  challenged with 10 times the immunising dose of T. parva Marikebuni stock.
  Twenty-four of these 27 cattle had high antibody titres before challenge. Two
  cross-bred calves, obtained from an ECF-free area and seronegative to T. parva
  schizont antigen, also were challenged and used as susceptible controls. Twenty
  -five (83%) of the 30 sentinel calves contracted ECF over an age range of 36
  -116 days (mean 72 days). The remaining five calves died of other causes within
  2 months of arrival on the farm. Fourteen of the 25 calves survived the
  infection and developed antibodies to T. parva. Despite tick control, seven of
  these 14 calves had a second episode of ECF and two died. In total, 13 of the
  25 calves that contracted ECF died. Only one of 19 indigenous Zebu animals
  developed clinical ECF when challenged with T. parva Marikebuni (mild clinical
  signs with spontaneous recovery). Of the eight cross-bred survivors from the
  first experiment, only one succumbed to ECF when challenged and it died. Both
  susceptible cross-bred calves developed severe clinical signs of ECF and one
  died. The experimental studies show that in the high ECF-risk areas of the
  coconut-cassava zone of coastal Kenya, immunisation against ECF in cross-bred
  (B. taurus/B. indicus) cattle should be targeted at an early age (preferably
  within 1-2 months of birth).

AB: Objective: To estimate the prevalence of resistance-conferring mutations to
  antiretroviral drugs in previously untreated patients with chronic HIV-1
  infection as a basis for French recommendations on viral genotyping before
  antiretroviral treatment initiation. Design: Resistance mutations were sought
  in samples from 404 patients seen in 23 specialized centres throughout
  metropolitan France in 1998. Methods: The protease and reverse transcriptase
  (RT) genes of plasma virions were sequenced. Primary and secondary protease and
  RT gene mutations were identified from the International AIDS Society
  resistance testing - USA panel. Results: The prevalence of patients with
  primary and secondary mutations were 3.7% (95% CI 1.7-5.7) and 50.3% (95% CI
  45.0-55.6), respectively. The prevalence of patients with mutations associated
  with resistance to nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTI) and non-nucleoside RT
  inhibitors was 3.3% (95% CI 1.5-5.1) and 0.8% (95% CI 0.0-1.7), respectively.
  The prevalence of patients with NRTI primary mutations differed according to
  whether seropositivity had been diagnosed more or less than one year previously
  (0.2 versus 2.2% P=0.023). Primary mutations associated with protease inhibitor
  resistance occurred at a prevalence of 1.9% (95% CI 0.5-3.4) with no difference
  according to the duration of known seropositivity. Conclusion: In France, in
  1998, the prevalence of patients with primary mutations associated with
  resistance to antiretroviral drugs was low. Genotyping before the initiation of
  therapy was not recommended in chronically HIV-1-infected naive patients. A
  national sentinel survey of resistance in this clinical setting is performed
  regularly to update the recommendations for resistance testing.

AB: Objective: To compare HIV prevalence in antenatal clinics (ANC) and the
  general population, and to identify factors determining the differences that
  were found. Design: Cross-sectional surveys in the general population and in
  ANC in three cities. Methods: HIV prevalence measured in adults in the
  community was compared with that measured by sentinel surveillance in ANC in
  Yaounde, Cameroon, Kisumu, Kenya, and Ndola, Zambia. Results: In Yaounde and
  Ndola, the HIV prevalence in ANC attenders was lower than that in women in the
  population overall, and for age groups over 20 years. In Kisumu, the HIV
  prevalence in ANC attenders was similar to that in women in the population at
  all ages. The only factors identified that influenced the results were age,
  marital status, parity, schooling, and contraceptive use. The HIV prevalence in
  women in ANC was similar to that in the combined male and female population
  aged 15-40 years in Yaounde and Ndola, but overestimated it in Kisumu. In
  Yaounde and Ndola, the overall HIV prevalence in men was approximated by using
  the age of the father of the child reported by ANC attenders, but this method
  overestimated the HIV prevalence in Kisumu, and did not give good age-specific
  estimates. Conclusion: Few factors influenced the difference in HIV prevalence
  between ANC and the population, which could aid the development of adjustment
  procedures to estimate population HIV prevalence. However, the differences
  between cities were considerable, making standard adjustments difficult. The
  method of estimating male HIV prevalence should be tested in other sites.

AB: Objective: The objective of this study was to explore whether the
  differences in rate of spread of HIV in different regions in sub-Saharan Africa
  could be explained by differences in sexual behaviour and/or factors
  influencing the probability of HIV transmission during sexual intercourse.
  Methods: A cross-sectional, population-based study was conducted in two cities
  with a high HIV prevalence (Kisumu in Kenya and Ndola in Zambia) and two cities
  with a relatively low HIV prevalence (Cotonou in Benin and Yaounde in
  Cameroon). In each of these cities, approximately 1000 men and 1000 women, aged
  15-49 years, were randomly selected from the general population. Consenting men
  and women were interviewed and were tested for HIV, syphilis, herpes simplex
  virus type 2 (HSV-2), gonorrhoea, chlamydial infection and trichomoniasis (the
  latter for women only). In addition, a survey was conducted on a random sample
  of 300 sex workers in each city. The research instruments, including the
  questionnaires and the laboratory procedures, were standardized to permit
  comparison of results. Results: The numbers of men interviewed were 1021 in
  Cotonou, 973 in Yaounde, 829 in Kisumu, and 720 in Ndola. The corresponding
  figures for women were 1095, 1116, 1060 and 1130. In Yaounde, Kisumu and Ndola,
  the response rates for men were lower than for women due to failure to make
  contact with eligible men. The proportion of eligible women who were
  interviewed was 86% in Yaounde, and 89% in Kisumu and Ndola. In Yaounde, 76% of
  eligible men were interviewed, along with 82% in Kisumu and 75% in Ndola. The
  prevalence of HIV infection in men was 3.3% in Cotonou, 4.1% in Yaounde, 19.8%
  in Kisumu and 23.2% in Ndola. For women, the respective figures were 3.4, 7.8,
  30.1 and 31.9%. The prevalence of HIV infection among women aged 15-19 years
  was 23.0% in Kisumu and 15.4% in Ndola. Among women in Kisumu who had their
  sexual debut 5 years before the interview, the prevalence of HIV infection was
  46%; in Ndola, it was 59%. Among sex workers, the prevalence of HIV infection
  was 57.5% in Cotonou, 34.4% in Yaounde, 74.7% in Kisumu and 68.7% in Ndola.
  Conclusions: The HIV prevalence rates in the general population confirmed our
  preliminary assessment of the level of HIV infection in the four cities, which
  was based on estimates of HIV prevalence from sentinel surveillance among
  pregnant women. The very high prevalence of HIV infection among young women in
  Kisumu and Ndola calls for urgent intervention.

AB: Drug-resistant falciparum malaria is increasing in Africa and so methods to
  map resistance on a broad scale are needed. A molecular marker for chloroquine
  resistance, pfcrt T76, can be used for surveillance of clinical chloroquine
  resistance. The prevalence of pfcrt T76 and the prevalence of clinical
  chloroquine resistance and therapeutic failure were measured at sentinel sites
  and used to calculate age-adjusted genotype-resistance indices (GRIs) and
  genotype-failure indices (GFIs). We found stable GRIs and GFIs at different
  sites in Mali, West Africa. This model permits mapping of chloroquine
  resistance using molecular tools in rapid and simple cross-sectional surveys.

AB: Background: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) dissection in the management of high
  -risk melanoma and other cancers, such as breast cancer, has recently increased
  in use. The procedure identifies an SLN by intradermal or intraparenchymal
  injection of an isosulfan blue dye, a radiocolloid, or both around the primary
  malignancy. Methods: At the time of selective SLN mapping, 3 to 5 mL of
  isosulfan blue was injected either intradermally or intraparenchymally around
  the primary malignancy. From October 1997 to May 2000, 267 patients underwent
  intraoperative lymphatic mapping with the use of both isosulfan 1% blue dye and
  radiocolloid injection. Five cases with adverse reactions to isosulfan blue
  were reviewed. Results: We report 2 cases of anaphylaxis and 3 cases of "blue
  hives" after injection with isosulfan blue of 267 patients who had
  intraoperative lymphatic mapping by the procedure described above. The 2
  patients with anaphylaxis experienced cardiovascular collapse, erythema,
  perioral edema, urticaria, and uvular edema. The blue hives in 3 patients
  resolved and transformed to blue patches during the course of the procedures.
  Conclusions: The incidence of allergic reactions in our series was 2.0%. As
  physicians expand the role of SLN mapping, they should consider the use of
  histamine blockers as prophylaxis and have emergency treatment readily
  available to treat the life-threatening complication of anaphylactic reaction.

AB: Background: The optimal sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy technique remains
  undefined in breast cancer. Injecting radiotracer or blue dye by a variety of
  routes seems to stage the axilla with comparable accuracy, and we have
  hypothesized that the dermal and the parenchymal lymphatics of the breast drain
  to the same SLN in most patients. Two previous studies from our institution
  support this concept: (1) a single-surgeon series of 200 consecutive SLN biopsy
  procedures demonstrating a high dye-isotope concordance for both intradermal
  (ID) and intraparenchymal (IP) isotope injection, and (2) a series of 100
  procedures validated by a backup axillary dissection (ALND) in which the false
  -negative rate following ID isotope injection was comparable to that of our
  previous results with IP injection. Here, we directly compare the results of
  SLN biopsy using either ID or IP isotope injection for our entire experience of
  SLN biopsy procedures in which a backup ALND was done. Methods: This is a
  retrospective, nonrandomized study of 298 clinical stage I to II breast cancer
  patients having SLN biopsy with a backup ALND planned in advance, comparing the
  results of ID (n=164) and IP (n=134) isotope injection. All patients had IP
  injection of blue dye. Endpoints included (1) successful SLN identification,
  (2) false-negative rate, (3) dye-isotope concordance, and (4) the SLN/axillary
  background isotope count ratio. Results: ID isotope was more successful than
  IP, identifying the SLN in 98% versus 89% of cases, respectively. False
  -negative results (4.8% vs 4.4%) and dye-isotope concordance (92% vs 93%) were
  comparable between the 2 groups, and SLN/axillary background isotope count
  ratios were significantly higher with ID than with IP injection (288/1 vs
  59/1). Conclusions: ID isotope injection identifies the SLN more often than IP,
  stages the axilla with comparable accuracy, and is associated with higher
  levels of SLN isotope uptake. The dermal and parenchymal lymphatics of the
  breast drain to the same axillary SLN in most breast cancer patients, and ID
  isotope injection is the procedure of choice in this setting.

AB: Specific-pathogen-free sentinel birds were used as an initial biological
  system to isolate infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) field isolates from
  commercial broiler farms exhibiting recurrent respiratory problems and poor
  performance. Reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was
  used to amplify a 248-bp product encompassing the hypervariable region of the
  IBDV VP2 gene. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the
  RT-PCR products was performed with the restriction endonucleases DraI, SacI,
  TaqI, StyI, BstNI, and SspI. Two isolates (619 and 850) exhibited a RFLP
  pattern characteristic of Delaware variant E IBDV. Restriction enzyme digestion
  for four isolates (625, 849, 853, and 11153) revealed unmatched RFLP patterns
  when compared with reference IBDV strains. Nucleotide and deduced amino acid
  sequence analyses of the VP2 hypervariable region for these six isolates
  revealed identity (96.3% up to 98%) with Delaware E variant IBDV strain.
  However, serine at position 254, which is characteristic of Delaware variant
  strains, was substituted by asparagine in these six isolates. The seventh IBDV
  isolate (9109) also exhibited a unique RFLP pattern, which included the SspI
  restriction site, which is characteristic of very virulent (vv) IBDV strains.
  Nucleotide and amino acid sequence analyses of the hypervariable region for
  this isolate revealed identity (90%) with the standard challenge strain.
  However, the leucine residue at position 294 was substituted by isoleucine.
  This substitution corresponds to one of the amino acids that are conserved in
  the vvIBDV strains. Antigenic index studies of the predicted amino acid
  sequence of the hypervariable region of VP2 from isolates 619, 625, 849, 850,
  853, and 11153 exhibited a profile almost identical to variant E, whereas the
  isolate 9109 exhibited a profile characteristic of standard IBDV strains.

AB: BACKGROUND. Many studies support the concept and accuracy of sentinel lymph
  node biopsy (SNB) for staging patients with breast carcinoma, which can be
  performed with low morbidity in lymph node negative patients. Preoperative
  chemotherapy (PC) plays an important role in the treatment of patients with
  operable breast carcinoma and is another approach with which to reduce radical
  surgery in patients with more advanced disease. It is of interest whether the
  sentinel lymph node accurately represents the axillary status after PC and,
  thus, whether the sentinel node concept can be applied to both groups. METHODS.
  Thirty-three patients underwent SNB after chemotherapy and prior to axillary
  lymph node dissection. RESULTS. The average greatest tumor dimension before
  chemotherapy (33 mm +- 2 mm) was significantly larger (P = 0.000) than after
  therapy (20 mm +- 3 mm). Histopathologic complete remission was seen in only
  three patients. One or two sentinel lymph nodes (average, 1.7 lymph nodes) were
  identified with certainty in 29 of 33 procedures and accurately predicted
  axillary lymph node status in all of these patients. Breast-conserving surgery
  was possible in 21 patients (64%), and axillary lymph nodes were involved in 22
  patients (67%). CONCLUSIONS. Even after patients undergo PC, SNB seems to be a
  reliable method for accurate staging of the axilla in those more advanced
  breast carcinoma. Thus, axillary dissection may be avoided in certain patients.
  Lymph node involvement seems to be likely in women with suspicious axillary
  findings before chemotherapy who have no visible sentinel lymph nodes on
  preoperative lymphosintigraphy and in patients without recurrent tumors.
  Further investigation of the SNB concept in this patient group should be
  evaluated in larger studies.

AB: The dispersal behavior of Trichogramma ostriniae Pang et Chen, a potential
  biological control agent of European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis Hubner, was
  investigated in fields of sweet corn in central New York. The aims of the study
  were to quantify T. ostriniae dispersal, to determine whether they persisted in
  release fields, and what minimum number of release points per unit area would
  be adequate to ensure uniform distribution of the wasps for augmentative
  releases. Dispersal was monitored from central release points over distances
  from 35 to 230 m, in a square 9 ha grid of monitoring points, using yellow
  sticky cards and O. nubilalis sentinel egg masses to detect T. ostriniae.
  Results showed that the wasps dispersed rapidly, up to 180 m in 6 days and 230
  m in 21 days. The number of T. ostriniae captured on sticky cards and sentinel
  egg mass parasitism decreased with distance from point of release, although 11
  -40% parasitism of egg masses occurred in monitoring positions most distant
  from the release points. Uniform parasitism of sentinel egg masses was achieved
  in areas of 1-2 ha surrounding central release points. It is suggested that a
  single release point per hectare should be adequate to ensure uniform dispersal
  of T. ostriniae into sweet corn fields.

AB: Vulvar cancer is a rare gynecologic malignancy whose primary treatment is
  surgical. It is not uncommon for patients to delay seeking medical attention or
  for physicians to delay diagnosing the condition. The most prevalent vulvar
  cancer is squamous cell carcinoma, with vulvar melanoma being the second most
  common. The basic understanding of the anatomy and the mechanisms of lymphatic
  spread have made modifications in surgical technique possible, allowing less
  radical excisions with significantly less morbidity. New approaches using
  lymphatic mapping with sentinel node dissection appear promising for the future
  treatment of early vulvar cancers.

AB: BACKGROUND: Initial studies of sentinel lymphadenectomy for patients with
  breast carcinoma confirmed that the status of the sentinel lymph nodes was an
  accurate predictor of the presence of metastatic disease in the axillary lymph
  nodes. Sentinel lymphadenectomy, as an axillary staging procedure, has risks of
  morbidity that have yet to be defined. METHODS: Patients were enrolled in a two
  -phase protocol that included concurrent data collection of patient
  characteristics and treatment variables. During the first (validation) phase,
  72 patients underwent sentinel lymph node excision followed by a level I-II
  axillary dissection. After the technique had been established, the second phase
  commenced, during which only patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes
  underwent an axillary dissection. RESULTS: During the second phase, lymphedema
  was identified in 9 of 303 patients (3.0%) who underwent sentinel
  lymphadenectomy alone and in 20 of 117 patients (17.1%) who underwent sentinel
  lymphadenectomy combined with axillary dissection (P<0.0001). Of 303 patients
  who underwent sentinel lymphadenectomy alone, 8 of 155 patients (5.1%) with
  tumors located in the upper outer quadrant and 1 of 148 patients (0.7%) with
  tumors in other locations developed lymphedema (P=0.012). CONCLUSIONS: The risk
  of developing lymphedema after undergoing sentinel lymphadenectomy was
  measurable but significantly lower than after undergoing axillary dissection.
  Tumor location in the upper outer quadrant and postoperative trauma and/or
  infection were identifiable risk factors for lymphedema.

AB: Little is known about fibroblasts from the female reproductive tract, much
  less whether or not functional subsets exist. Fibroblasts are key as sentinel
  cells for recruiting white blood cells and for wound healing. The purpose of
  this research was to evaluate the possibility that functional subsets of
  fibroblasts exist in the human female reproductive tract. The strategy used was
  to define fibroblast subpopulations based on their surface expression of the
  Thy 1 antigen. In situ staining of human myometrium and endometrium showed
  heterogeneous staining for Thy 1. Freshly derived strains of fibroblasts from
  the myometrium and endometrium also demonstrated heterogeneous Thy 1
  expression. For the first time, using magnetic beading and fluorescence
  -activated cell sorting, human myometrial fibroblasts were successfully
  separated into functionally unique Thy 1+ and Thy 1- subsets. Both subsets
  produced the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 after IL
  -1beta stimulation, but only the Thy 1+ subset produced MCP-1. Furthermore,
  only Thy 1+ fibroblasts up-regulated CD40 surface expression with IL-1beta or
  interferon-gamma treatment. Engagement of CD40 in the Thy 1+ subpopulation
  induced IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1. The discovery of functional subsets of
  reproductive tract fibroblasts now permits assessment of their roles in the
  normal functions of the reproductive tract and in disease states such as
  adhesions and menorrhagia.

AB: Parasites are attracting increasing interest from parasite ecologists as
  potential indicators of environmental quality due to the variety of ways in
  which they respond to anthropogenic pollution. In environmental impact studies
  certain organisms provide valuable information about the chemical state of
  their environment not through their presence or absence but instead through
  their ability to concentrate environmental toxins within their tissues. Free
  living invertebrates, notably bivalve molluscs, are commonly employed in this
  role as 'sentinel organisms' to monitor the concentrations of bioavailable
  metals in aquatic ecosystems. Also certain parasites, particularly intestinal
  acanthocephalans of fish, can accumulate heavy metals to concentrations orders
  of magnitude higher than those in the host tissues or the environment. The
  comparison of metal accumulation capacities between acanthocephalans and
  established free living sentinel organisms revealed significantly higher
  concentrations of several elements in Acanthocephalus lucii (Mueller) than in
  the Zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas) which is a commonly used
  bioindicating organism in Europe. In contrast to the high heavy metal
  concentrations recorded in adult acanthocephalans, the larval stages in their
  respective crustacean intermediate hosts show little tendency to accumulate
  metals. A number of experimental studies demonstrate a clear time dependent
  accumulation of lead for acanthocephalans in their final hosts. These
  investigations provide evidence that the extremely high metal concentrations in
  intestinal acanthocephalans of fish are not the result of a slow process of
  accumulation but instead a relatively rapid uptake to a steady-state level.
  Thus, metal concentrations in adult acanthocephalans respond rapidly to changes
  in environmental exposure of their hosts. The value of parasites for
  environmental monitoring will be discussed in detail in the present article.

AB: The identification of specific tumor mRNA markers by reverse transcription
  -polymerase chain reaction might be a valuable diagnostic adjunct for the
  detection of breast cancer metastases in axillary sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs).
  In this study we have compared the diagnostic accuracy of an extensive
  histopathologic examination of 146 SLNs from 123 breast carcinoma patients with
  that of the evaluation of 5 mRNA markers. When analyzed individually, none of
  the different markers attained a sensitivity higher than 77.8%, and the general
  concordance with the histopathologic findings ranged from 78.8 to 83.6%. In a
  multiple-marker assay, taking into account the expression of at least 1 of the
  5 tumor markers, the sensitivity of the test rose to 95.6%, with a specificity
  of 66.3% and a general concordance with the histopathologic status of 75.3%.
  Finally, when at least 2 of 3 markers (maspin, cytokeratin 19 and mammaglobin
  1) were expressed, the concordance with either SLN or axillary lymph node
  status was highest (88.4% and 84.6%, respectively). The high prevalence of
  positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays in
  histologically uninvolved SLNs, however, may hamper extensive application of
  these techniques in the clinical setting.

AB: Under the approval of the ethics committee in our university, we initiated a
  clinical trial to evaluate two lymphatic mapping procedures combined with a
  lymphoscintigram of the sentinel lymph node in breast cancer surgery. The
  mapping methods consist of the radioisotope tin colloid method and the dye
  -guided method. In the three cases we have studied to date, we were able to
  identify the sentinel lymph node in each case. The lymphoscintigram was able to
  reveal the sentinel node from 1 to 3 hours after injection of the radioisotope
  tin colloid. Sentinel nodes were successfully detected using both the
  scintigram and hand-held gamma probe methods. However, in one of these cases,
  the dye staining did not allow detection of the sentinel nodes. The estimated
  radioactivity associated with the procedure equaled that of the background of
  the operating room. We suggest that the combined approach of using two
  lymphatic mapping procedures and a lymphoscintigram yields a high rate of
  detection of the sentinel lymph node.

AB: Background. This analysis was performed to identify prognostic factors that
  are predictive of sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis in melanoma. Methods.
  Analysis was performed of a multi-institutional, prospective, randomized trial
  of SLN biopsy for melanoma. Eligibility criteria included age 18 to 70 years,
  Breslow thickness of 1.0 mm or more, and clinically negative regional lymph
  nodes. SLNs were evaluated by serial sectioning and immunohistochemistry for
  S100. Univariate chi-square and multivariate logistic regression analyses were
  performed to assess factors predictive of the presence of a positive SLN.
  Probability values of less than .05 were considered significant. Results. SLNs
  were identified in 99.7% of patients. A total of 1058 patients were evaluated;
  961 patients had complete data and were included in the statistical analysis.
  SLNs were positive for tumor in 208 of 961 patients (22%). Breslow thickness,
  Clark level, ulceration, and patient age were factors that were found to be
  independently predictive of the presence of SLN metastasis. Conclusions.
  Increasing Breslow thickness, Clark level of more than III, the presence of
  ulceration, and patient of age of 60 years or less are the most important
  independent prognostic factors associated with the finding of positive SLN in
  patients with melanoma.

  raptorellus Kogan & Legner were released weekly for 12 wk into a high-rise,
  caged-layer poultry house. After the release period, parasitoids were sampled
  using sentinel house fly (Musca domestica L.) pupae that were either laboratory
  -reared or field-collected as larvae and exposed for 2, 4, 7, and 14 d.
  Parasitoid-induced mortality was observed in 31% of laboratory colony pupae and
  in 26% of field-collected pupae, whereas successful parasitism rates of 48 and
  51% were observed from these pupal sources, respectively. Parasitism was
  primarily by M. raptorellus (88%), and Muscidifurax raptor Girault & Sanders
  (11%), while N. vitripennis accounted for <1%. Percent female progeny ranged
  from 43% in M. raptorellus to 76% in N. vitripennis. Parasitoid emergence from
  2-d exposed sentinel pupae was the lowest of all treatments. Parasitoid
  emergence from 7-d exposed sentinel pupae was the highest of all treatments. We
  found no differences between pupal source, suggesting that when sampling for M.
  raptor, M. raptorellus, and N. vitripennis, in poultry facilities, pupal source
  is not a confounding factor.

  elements extracted from ingesta were lower than in seeds and sediments from the
  study site. Notable exceptions were barium and lead, which were not detected in
  seeds of some plant species, though the were present in the ingesta of one or
  more treatment groups. This technique may provide a more realistic means of
  estimating bioavailability and exposure than methods which measure total
  concentrations of elements in dietary components. The use of sentinel mallards

AB: Aflatoxin contamination of cottonseed causes significant economic loss for
  Arizona farmers because it prevents access to premium markets for their crop.
  Aspergillus flavus, the cause of aflatoxin contamination of cottonseed, can be
  divided into the S and L strains based on sclerotial morphology. S strain
  isolates are highly toxigenic whereas L strain isolates are variable in
  aflatoxin production. Some L strain A. flavus isolates produce no aflatoxin. An
  atoxigenic L strain of A. flavus (AF36), occurring naturally in Arizona, is
  currently part of an aflatoxin management program. In 1999, ten sentinel sites
  distant from AF36 treatment areas were chosen to develop baseline data on
  statewide AF36 incidence. Over 1200 isolates were characterized as S or L
  strain. The L strain isolates were tested for vegetative compatibility to AF36.
  AF36 was detected at eight sentinel sites from Brawley, CA to Safford, AZ (540
  km). AF36 incidence in individual fields ranged from 0 to 7.3%. S strain
  incidence at the sentinel sites was combined with data from 1998 to develop a
  statewide map estimating S strain incidence prior to initiation of the
  management program. These data suggest that S strain incidence is inversely
  correlated with elevation in Arizona.

AB: The garden snail (Helix aspersa) is currently used as bioindicator of
  metallic pollution. Our objective was to extend its use to organic chemicals by
  studying the effects and tissue concentrations of the organophosphorus
  pesticide dimethoate following dietary uptake. After exposure for four weeks to
  increasing doses of pesticide in the diet, the median lethal concentration
  (LC50) was determined to be 3,700 mug/g food. Clinical signs indicated a no
  -observed-effect concentration of 100 mug/g and a lowest-observed-effect
  concentration of 250 mug/g. The growth parameters were decreased with
  increasing exposure to the pesticide. The median effective concentration
  (EC50), which was evaluated based on both shell diameter and dry weight
  inhibitions, was 665 and 424 mug/g, respectively, and the EC10 was 180 and 145
  mug/g, respectively. Accumulation in the viscera was related to the amount of
  dimethoate in the food. The bioconcentration factors were low (>6X10-3).
  Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was strongly decreased (80% from 250
  mug/g). In conclusion, we demonstrated that the species H. aspersa could be a
  useful sentinel organism for organophosphorus contamination surveys. Among the
  effects measured, the inhibition of AChE activities and clinical signs were the
  most sensitive, followed by the growth parameters. These results confirm the
  suitability of the garden snail for development of sublethal toxicity tests
  using primary consumers and aboveground organisms.

AB: Previous studies have demonstrated no difference in micronucleus (MN)
  frequencies between wild rodents chronically exposed to the environmental
  radiation contamination of the Chornobyl (Ukraine) exclusion zone and those
  inhabiting reference populations. The aim of the present study was to test the
  hypothesis that a population of bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) has
  developed radioresistance as a result of 14 years of chronic, low-dose
  radiation exposure. Naive voles were placed in environmental enclosures in the
  Red Forest region of the exclusion zone for 30 d. Blood samples were obtained
  at regular intervals, and the MN assay was used to assess chromosomal damage.
  Additionally, radionuclide uptake was monitored throughout the study, and dose
  was documented for each individual as well as for their offspring. Total dose
  for the voles experimentally exposed in this environment averaged 1.09 Gy
  (36.20 mGy d-1) for the 30-d study period. Our results indicate that exposure
  to radiation levels well above regulatory statutes did not result in an
  increased MN frequency. Furthermore, our results do not support the hypothesis
  that voles chronically exposed to these radiation levels have developed a
  genetic basis for radioresistance that is unique from that present in naive
  populations. The use of C. glareolus as a sentinel species for environmental
  studies of radiation contamination and the question of whether the MN assay is
  an appropriate endpoint for studies of low-dose, chronic radiation exposure are
  also discussed.

AB: Purpose: The objective of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of the
  sentinel node selective biopsy of patients with breast cancer, and determine if
  it has sufficient value to be incorporated into an oncology protocol. Material
  and methods: Forty patients with breast cancer were studied (39 women and 1
  man), with a mean age of 59.5 years (range, 37-82 years). A lymphoscintigraphy
  was made after the peritumoral injection of 3 doses, 1mCi/ml each, of two types
  of nanocolloids. The scans were performed between 2 and 18 hours after the
  injection, in both lateral and anterior projections, the skin marked, and the
  localization checked with a detecting probe. In the operating room, helped by a
  gamma probe, the sentinel node was located and removed. Results: Gammagraphy
  identified the sentinel node in 77.5% of the cases (31/40 patients), and the
  detecting probe in 96.7% (30/31). The intraoperatory biopsy of the sentinel
  node showed metastatic invasion in 8 patients. The definitive biopsy showed
  metastatic invasion only in 5 patients, what means a fase negative rate of
  22.7% for the intraoperatory biopsy. Conclusion: The described technique is
  simple and very sensitive for the location of the sentinel node, predicting in
  a 100% of the cases the state of the axilary nodes. The technique can be
  recommended to forming part of a protocol, being aware that the degree of
  success depends on the adequacy of a series of clinical, nuclear medicine, and
  anatomicopathological factors.

AB: The objectives of this study were to monitor the trends of the HIV epidemic
  between 1995 and 1999 among pregnant women in Bobo-Dioulasso, the second
  largest town of Burkina Faso, and to discuss the possible effect of preventive
  interventions (condom availability) on sexual transmission of HIV in this
  context. Age-specific trends in HIV prevalence obtained from sentinel
  surveillance programme were analysed. Among antenatal clinic attendees, HIV
  prevalence was 7.5% (n=401) in 1995, 10% (n=200) in 1996, 7.6% (n=448) in 1997,
  8.4% (n=642) in 1998 and 5.3% (n=716) in 1999 without demonstrated temporal
  trend (P=0.12). The average number of condoms available per person (aged 15-49
  years) per year increased from 0.6 in 1992 to 5.7 in 1995 and 6.0 in 1999.
  Anonymous surveys are less subject to selection bias and suggest a
  stabilization of the HIV prevalence around 7.3% in Bobo-Dioulasso. Distribution
  of condoms could explain at least, partly, this stabilization of the HIV
  epidemic.

AB: Data from a general practice-based, case-control study on gastroenteritis
  and the pathogens related to this disease were used to study the association
  between specific pathogens and the infected patients' ages and symptoms. For
  comparison, the occurrence of these pathogens in control patients, stratified
  by age, also is presented. In children with gastroenteritis who were <5 years
  of age, rotavirus (in 21% of patients) and Norwalk-like virus (NLV; in 15%)
  were the most common pathogens. Among patients who were 5-14 years of age,
  Campylobacter species (in 16% of patients) and Giardia lamblia (in 10%) were
  the most common pathogens. In the older patients, Campylobacter species was
  also the most common pathogen (8% to 15% of patients). In addition, several
  symptoms in case patients were associated with specific pathogens. Blood in the
  stool was associated with infection with Campylobacter species. In patients
  with fever, Salmonella species, Campylobacter species, and rotavirus were
  detected relatively often. Vomiting was associated with NLV and rotavirus. This
  is the first study in The Netherlands and one of the first studies in the world
  that has investigated a broad range of pathogens recovered from an unselected
  population of patients who had consulted general practitioners because of
  gastroenteritis.

AB: Primary therapy of penile cancer (carcinoma in situ/T1 tumors) consists of
  circumcision, microsurgical excision, application of 5-fluorouracil cream,
  radiation, or laser treatment. In cases of larger T1 tumors or T2 and distal T3
  tumors, partial penectomy with a 2-cm margin of clearance is mandatory.
  Secondary therapy includes inguinal lymphadenectomy 4-6 weeks after primary
  treatment and antibiotic prophylaxis. Independent prognostic factors for the
  presence of lymph node metastases are T stage and grading. Only patients with
  noninvasive G1 or G2 tumors and nonpalpable inguinal lymph nodes are candidates
  for surveillance with careful follow-up. Inguinal lymphadenectomy is performed
  in a radical or modified (Catalona) manner. Sentinel biopsy (Cabanas) may
  regain importance with the use of gamma probes. Complication rates of inguinal
  lymphadenectomy correlate to the extent of the procedure and must be weighed
  against the possibility of cure with lymphadenectomy. In cases of inguinal
  lymph node metastasis, removal of the iliac lymph nodes (one- or two-step
  procedure) is necessary.

AB: Sentinel dendritic cells are likely to encounter both live and dead bacteria
  at sites of infection. Although dendritic cells can phagocytose such bacteria,
  their principle role is not in bacterial killing but in stimulation of a
  subsequent adaptive immune response. In contrast, neutrophils at the site of
  infection play a major role in bacterial killing, in part via oxidative
  chlorination by myeloperoxidase products. In this study, the interaction
  between bacterial phagocytosis and the antigen processing function of dendritic
  cells is examined. Ingestion of heat-killed Salmonella typhimurium, or bacteria
  killed by oxidative chlorination, induces up-regulation of co-stimulatory
  molecules on dendritic cells, and strong stimulation of the TH1-inducing
  proinflammatory cytokines IL-12 and TNF-alpha. In contrast, induction of nitric
  oxide production is weak. Finally, phagocytosis of bacteria inhibits processing
  of protein antigen, but only if phagocytosis precedes exposure to antigen by 24
  hours. Phagocytosis itself has no inhibitory effect on the concomitant
  processing and presentation of either protein or peptide antigen to T cells.
  These results demonstrate that both phagocytic and antigen processing pathways
  can operate simultaneously within dendritic cells, allowing these sentinel
  cells to operate effectively at the site of bacterial infection.

AB: Specimens obtained from 92 patients with invasive ductal carcinoma of the
  breast by quadrantectomy and axillary lymph node dissection were examined to
  evaluate the relationship between existence of lymphatic invasion in
  peritumoral breast tissue and presence of axillary lymph node metastasis. The
  number of lymphatic invasions was classified into 4 groups (ly0-3) by counting
  the number of peritumoral lymphatic invasions. In addition,
  immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin was performed to locate micrometastasis in
  the dissected lymph nodes. Thirty-seven (40.2%) of 92 cases had foci of
  lymphatic invasion and 29 (31.5%) cases revealed lymph node metastasis on
  initial routine examination. The rate of diagnosis of lymph node metastasis
  assessed by the existence of lymphatic invasion had an accuracy of 84.8%, a
  sensitivity of 89.7% and a specificity of 82.5%. On the other hand, all 3 cases
  (4.8%) with micrometastasis detected by immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin,
  showed lymphatic invasion. The rate of diagnosis after detection of
  micrometastasis increased and exhibited 88.0% accuracy. In addition, the rate
  of prediction of lymph node metastasis in cases with tumor larger than 15 mm
  was also high, and its accuracy was 88.2%. These results suggest that the
  assessment of peritumoral lymphatic invasion is very useful for predicting the
  presence of axillary lymph node metastasis including micrometastasis. They also
  suggest that excision specimens should be examined for lymphatic invasion, and
  that the results of the examination might be necessary to pick up false
  -negative cases and those at high risk for lymph node metastasis among patients
  who have not undergone lymph node dissection based on the result of sentinel
  lymph node biopsy.

AB: Objective: To investigate the clinical significance of locating sentinel
  lymph nodes (SLN) and detecting the axillary lymph node micrometastases in
  breast cancer. Methods: In 20 breast cancer patients, methylene blue was
  injected into the breast parenchyma to locate the SLNs, and nested-RT-PCR was
  used to examine the expression of mammaglobin mRNA. Results: The SLN was
  successfully identified in 17 of 20 cases (85%), the micrometastases detection
  between groups of SLNs and non-SLNs had significant difference (P<0.01). In the
  routine pathological examination of negative lymph nodes, the detection rate of
  micrometastases was 15.6% (17/109) by nested-RT-PCR. Conclusion: The
  mammaglobin nested-RT-PCR is more sensitive than routine pathological method
  for the detection of micrometastases. The combined utilization of locating SLN
  and nested-RT-PCR can greatly enhance the efficiency of micrometastases
  detection in axillary lymph nodes.

AB: Objective-Dyspepsia usually presents first in primary care. There are many
  reasons for referral including urgent problems (for example, haematemesis and
  melaena), treatment failure, or to exclude serious pathology. Referral will
  change the population characteristics of primary and secondary care dyspeptics.
  Many of the guidelines for primary care dyspepsia, however, are based on
  secondary care research on these referred patients. The aim of this study was
  to describe the prevalence of dyspepsia in general practice, the
  characteristics of patients presenting with dyspepsia in primary care, and the
  clinical and non-clinical determinants of referral in these patients. Design
  -Cross sectional survey of the consultation records of patients presenting with
  dyspepsia in primary care during a one year period. Methods-Dyspeptic patients
  who consulted their general practitioner (GP) in 1997 were selected on the
  basis of International Classification of Primary Care codes using a computer
  search among 20 sentinel practices affiliated with the Utrecht Network of
  General Practitioners. Cross tables and logistic regression analysis were
  carried out to reveal patient characteristics and determinants of referral.
  Results-The prevalence of dyspepsia presenting in primary care in 1997 was 3.4%
  (1740/48958). These patients were usually not referred during the first
  consultation. Men, elderly patients, and patients with a previous history of
  dyspepsia were referred to secondary care more frequently than other dyspeptic
  patients. Patients diagnosed with both irritable bowel syndrome and dyspepsia
  were at risk of being referred most. Conclusion-Dyspepsia is a frequently
  occurring complaint in primary care and patients are usually treated by their
  GP. Besides clinically relevant reasons for referral, dyspeptic patients with
  irritable bowel syndrome seem to be more "at risk" of being referred to
  secondary care than other dyspeptic patients. The differences between primary
  and secondary care dyspeptic patients should be taken into account when
  interpreting research for guidelines purposes. Further research is needed to
  clarify the background of the relation between irritable bowel syndrome and
  dyspepsia and its influence on referral.

AB: Objective: To improve the methodological basis for modelling the HIV/AIDS
  epidemics in adults in sub-Saharan Africa, with examples from Botswana, Central
  African Republic, Ethiopia, and Zimbabwe. Understanding the magnitude and
  trajectory of the HIV/AIDS epidemic is essential for planning and evaluating
  control strategies. Methods: Previous mathematical models were developed to
  estimate epidemic trends based on sentinel surveillance data from pregnant
  women. In this project, we have extended these models in order to take full
  advantage of the available data. We developed a maximum likelihood approach for
  the estimation of model parameters and used numerical simulation methods to
  compute uncertainty intervals around the estimates. Findings: In the four
  countries analysed, there were an estimated half a million new adult HIV
  infections in 1999 (range: 260 to 960 thousand), 4.7 million prevalent
  infections (range: 3.0 to 6.6 million), and 370 thousand adult deaths from AIDS
  (range: 266 to 492 thousand). Conclusion: While this project addresses some of
  the limitations of previous modelling efforts, an important research agenda
  remains, including the need to clarify the relationship between sentinel data
  from pregnant women and the epidemiology of HIV and AIDS in the general
  population.

AB: With the goal to establish a model that relates birth weight to placenta
  weight, adjusted for the most documented predictors of birth weight, 300 live
  newborns were studied, all were products of single gestation. Inclusion
  criteria were newborns with gestational age of 37 weeks or older according to
  the date of last menstruation, whose mothers did not have diabetes mellitus,
  high blood pressure, pre-eclampsia, or eclampsia. The weight of the newborn was
  identified from the anthropometry data collected by previously trained nursing
  personnel in each of the participating hospitals. Immediately after delivery,
  the placenta was weighed. Multiple linear regression was used to see the effect
  of placenta weight and each variable on birth weight. The mean of birth weight
  was 3,369 g with a standard deviation (SD) of 445 g. Placenta weight had a mean
  of 537 g (SD: 96 g). The relation between the weight of the placenta and the
  birth weight was significant, and we found that for each gram increase in
  placenta weight, birth weight is increased by 1.98 g (SE = 0.25, p < 0.01) and
  this relation is not linear, since the quadratic term is significant. Placenta
  weight has a nonlinear relation to the birth weight and is an important
  predictor of birth weight. Together with the gestational age and the maternal
  age and size, it explains 32% of the variability of birth weight. Placenta
  weight can be a 'sentinel' indicator of nutritional and/or environmental
  problems.

AB: The concept of sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer surgery relates
  to the fact that the tumor drains in a logical way through the lymphatic
  system, from the first to upper levels. Therefore, the first lymph node met
  (the sentinel node) will most likely be the first to be affected by metastasis,
  and a negative sentinel node makes it highly unlikely that other nodes are
  affected. Because axillary node dissection does not improve prognosis of
  patients with breast cancer (being important only to stage the axilla),
  sentinel lymph node biopsy might replace complete axillary dissection to stage
  the axilla in clinically NO patients. Sentinel lymph node biopsy would
  represent a significant advantage as a minimally invasive procedure,
  considering that, after surgery, about 70% of patients are found to be free
  from metastatic disease, yet axillary node dissection can lead to significant
  morbidity. Furthermore, histologic sampling errors can be reduced if a single
  (sentinel) node is assessed extensively rather than few histologic sections in
  a high number of lymph nodes per patient. Although the pattern of lymph
  drainage from breast cancer can be variable, the mammary gland and the
  overlying skin can be considered as a biologic unit in which lymphatics tend to
  follow the vasculature. Therefore, considering that tumor lymphatics are
  disorganized and relatively ineffective, subdermal and peritumoral injection of
  small aliquots of radiotracer is preferred to intratumoral administration.
  99mTc-labeled colloids with most of the particles in the 100- to 200-nm size
  range would be ideal for radioguided sentinel node biopsy in breast cancer.
  Lymphoscintigraphy is an essential part of radioguided sentinel lymph node
  biopsy because images are used to direct the surgeon to the site of the node.
  The sentinel lymph node should have a significantly higher count than that of
  background (at least 10:1 intraoperatively). After removal of the sentinel
  node, the axilla must be reexamined to ensure that all radioactive sites are
  identified and removed for analysis. The sentinel lymph node should be
  processed for intraoperative frozen section examination in its entirety, based
  on conventional histopathology and, when needed, immune staining with
  anticytokeratin antibody. The success rate of radioguidance in localizing the
  sentinel lymph node in breast cancer surgery is about 94%-97% in institutions
  where a high number of procedures are performed and approaches 99% when
  combined with the vital blue dye technique. At present, there is no definite
  evidence that negative sentinel lymph node biopsy is invariably correlated with
  negative axillary status, except perhaps for T1a-b breast cancers, with a size
  of ltoreq 1 cm. Randomized clinical trials should elucidate the impact of
  avoiding axillary node dissection on patients with a negative sentinel lymph
  node on the long-term clinical outcome of patients.

AB: Background Tyrosinase reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT
  -PCR) has been shown to be highly sensitive in detecting tumour cells in
  melanoma patients. Objective To assess whether the detection of minimal
  residual disease by RT-PCR is improved by concomitant analysis of sentinel
  lymph nodes (SLNs), bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) in patients with
  primary melanoma. Methods Thirty-five SLNs, 41 BM samples and 26 PB specimens
  from 26 patients with primary cutaneous melanoma (tumour thickness gtoreq 0.75
  mm) were examined by nested RT-PCR for tyrosinase and Melan-A. SLNs and BM
  samples were also analysed by histopathology. RT-PCR findings were related to
  tumour thickness of the primary melanoma. Results Overall, melanoma cells were
  detected by RT-PCR in 13 of 26 patients (50%). Seven patients had positive RT
  -PCR results in their SLNs (27%), including all patients (n = 4) with
  histologically positive SLNs, two patients had positive findings in their BM
  exclusively detected by RT-PCR (8%) and six patients in PB (23%). The presence
  of tumour cells detected by RT-PCR in SLNs was not related to the presence of
  melanoma cells in BM and/or PB. The incidence of RT-PCR-positive SLNs was
  significantly associated with greater tumour thickness (P = 0.004). Both
  patients with positive RT-PCR findings in their BM had a large tumour thickness
  (gtoreq 2 mm). No association between positive RT-PCR findings in PB and
  greater tumour thickness was observed. Conclusions RT-PCR-positive SLNs were
  strongly associated with greater tumour thickness, underlining the prognostic
  significance of SLN positivity. Similar to certain epithelial malignancies,
  molecular investigation of the BM might provide complementary prognostic
  information in the early stages of melanoma. In contrast, no association
  between positive RT-PCR results in PB and increasing tumour thickness was
  found, implying that RT-PCR findings in PB are of doubtful clinical relevance
  in primary melanoma.

AB: Background: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of sentinel
  lymph node biopsy and that of four-node sampling for predicting other nodal
  status in breast cancer. Methods: 206 patients with operable breast cancer were
  enrolled. The identification of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) was carried out in
  110 patients using a gamma probe after injection of radioactive tin colloids.
  Four palpable lymph nodes (FNs) were removed from the lower axilla at the first
  step of axillary dissection in 98 patients. The predictive value of nodal
  status was compared between SLNs and FNs, based on the pathological findings of
  all dissected lymph nodes. To examine the relationship between SLNs and FNs, we
  chose the FNs retrospectively (defined as rFNs) from among all nodes in SLNs.
  Results: SLNs were identified in 108 (98%) of 110 patients. With one patient
  having skip metastasis, the accuracy and sensitivity were 99 and 98%,
  respectively. In the four-node sampling (FNS) group, two in 98 patients had
  skip metastasis and the accuracy and sensitivity were 98 and 96%, respectively.
  Findings on the relationship between these methods of biopsy were as follows:
  (i) rFNs included SLNs in 79 patients (73%); (ii) rFNs partially included SLNs
  in 24 patients (22%); and (iii) no relationship was evident in five patients
  (5%). Conclusions: The accuracy/sensitivity of FNs was comparable to that of
  SLNs. FNS can be considered to represent a highly promising approach and may be
  used as an alternative procedure that can be performed safely and easily in any
  institute.

AB: Objective. The aim of this study is to analyze whether the axillary status
  influences the lymphatic mapping procedure in malignant breast disease and
  whether clinically relevant consequences for the technique of Sentinel Node
  (SN) biopsy may be drawn from this information. Materials and methods. SN
  biopsy was performed in 150 consecutive patients using a combination of the
  radioguided and the blue-dye technique. Axillary status was compared with the
  number of detected nodes. In cases of numerous nodes with tracer uptake, the
  radioactivity of each radiolabeled node was measured separately in a dose
  calibrator. We analyzed whether an increased tracer uptake could possibly
  indicate a 'true' or 'dominant' SN. Blue dye uptake was registered and compared
  with radioactivity. The findings were related to the histologic results.
  Results. In patients with a positive axillary status, significantly more
  radiolabeled nodes were detected than in node negative patients (median 3 vs.
  2; p < 0.001). In 54/86 patients with numerous SNs a 'dominant' node with at
  least twice the radioactivity than other marked nodes could be identified
  (62.8%). From 26 cases with axillary involvement, 20 patients (76.9%) were
  identified by the 'dominant' and the remaining six women (23.1%) by others than
  the seemingly leading SN. Conclusion. Axillary lymph node involvement
  influences the drainage pattern in breast cancer. Patients with numerous SNs
  have an increased risk of axillary involvement. A high tracer uptake does not
  permit the identification of a 'true' SN. A lack of surgical accuracy may lead
  to pitfalls if the axilla is not screened carefully for all radioactive nodes.

AB: Purpose: We examined the possibility for detecting sentinel nodes in
  patients with bladder cancer and whether the histopathological status of
  identified sentinel nodes reflected that of the lymphatic field. Materials and
  Methods: A total of 13 patients with bladder cancer who met the criteria
  qualifying them for radical cystectomy had intravesical injections of
  radioactive tracer and blue dye marker around the tumor followed by
  lymphoscintigraphy to visualize lymphatic drainage and detect sentinel nodes.
  Sentinel nodes were identified preoperatively by the blue color and increased
  radioactivity and were compared histopathologically with other routinely
  excised lymph nodes. Results: Sentinel nodes were detected in 85% (11 of 13) of
  patients. There were 4 patients who had sentinel nodes containing tumor cells,
  and each metastasis was only seen in the detected sentinel node. There were no
  false-negative sentinel nodes. Of the metastatic sentinel nodes 3 were located
  outside the normally excised lymph nodes of the obturator fossa. Conclusions:
  Sentinel nodes can be detected in patients with bladder cancer. The
  histopathological status of the identified sentinel nodes was diagnostic for
  all other excised lymph nodes. Sentinel nodes often seem to be located outside
  the obturator lymphatic field, which is normally examined during preoperative
  staging of bladder cancer.

AB: We have investigated the 20 early gastric cardia cancer patients who have
  undergone resection during the past 24 years. Early cardia cancer showed male
  preponderance, higher incidences of macroscopically elevated type, of
  histologically differentiated type, and of submucosal cancer as compared with
  the overall data concerning early gastric cancer. Nodal involvement was not
  observed in mucosal cancer, whereas, in submucosal cancer, it was confined to
  the first-tier with low frequency (7%). Therefore, local resection with
  adjacent lymphadenectomy and gastroesophageal anastomosis is feasible for
  mucosal cancer. The majority of submucosal cancer patients are potentially
  candidates for local resection, but sentinel node navigation may enable
  physicians to discriminate patients who should undergo systematic
  lymphadenectomy from those who need not.

AB: BACKGROUND: False-negative results from lymphatic mapping and sentinel
  lymphadenectomy (LM/SL) are associated with technical failures in nuclear
  medicine and surgery or with erroneous histologic evaluation. Any method that
  can confirm sentinel lymph node (SN) identity might decrease the false-negative
  rate. Carbon dye has been used as an adjunct to assist lymphadenectomy for some
  tumors, and the authors hypothesized that it could be used for the histologic
  verification of SNs removed during LM/SL. The current study assessed the
  clinical utility of carbon dye as a histopathologic adjunct for the
  identification of SNs in patients with melanoma and correlated the presence of
  carbon particles with the histopathologic status of the SNs. METHODS: LM/SL was
  performed using carbon dye (India ink) combined with isosulfan blue dye and
  sulfur colloid. Blue-stained and/or radioactive lymph nodes (two times
  background) were defined as SNs. Lymph nodes were evaluated for the presence of
  carbon particles and melanoma cells. If an SN lacked carbon dye in the initial
  histologic sections, four additional levels were obtained with S-100 protein
  and HMB-45 immunohistochemistry. Completion lymph node dissection (CLND) was
  performed if any SN contained melanoma cells. RESULTS: One hundred patients
  underwent successful LM/SL in 120 lymph node regions. Carbon particles were
  identified in 199 SNs from 111 lymph node regions of 96 patients. Sixteen
  patients had tumor-positive SNs, all of which contained carbon particles. The
  anatomic location of the carbon particles within these tumor-positive SNs was
  found to be correlated with the location of tumor cells in the SNs. The
  presence of carbon particles appeared to be correlated with blue-black staining
  (P=0.0001) and with tumor foci (P=0.028). All 35 non-SNs that were removed
  during LM/SL were tumor-negative, and only 2 contained carbon particles. Of the
  272 non-SNs removed during CLND, 5 contained metastases; 3 of these 5 were the
  only non-SNs that had carbon particles. The use of carbon particles during
  LM/SL was found to be safe and nontoxic. CONCLUSIONS: Carbon dye used in LM/SL
  for melanoma permits the histologic confirmation of SNs. Carbon particles
  facilitate histologic evaluation by directing the pathologist to the SNs most
  likely to contain tumor. The location of carbon particles within SNs may assist
  the pathologist in the detection of metastases, thereby decreasing the
  histopathologic false-negative rate of LM/SL and subsequently reducing the same
  -basin recurrence rate.

  injecting tumor-bearing tissue with a marking composition, radiating marking
  -agent-targeting energy into suspect tissues potentially harboring the sentinel
  node, and detecting a lymph node within the suspect tissues first infiltrated
  by the marking agent. The method is conducted without detecting radioactivity,
  and thus avoids the health and environmental problems posed by methods based on
  detecting radiolabels. Moreover, the method obviates the need for surgical
  dissection to initially detect potential sentinel nodes. Also provided are
  systems for performing the method and compositions for use in the method.

AB: Objective: The objective of this paper was to analyse the quality of
  HIV/AIDS sentinel surveillance systems in countries and the resulting quality
  of the data used to make estimates of HIV/AIDS prevalence and mortality.
  Methods: Available data on sero-surveillance of HIV/AIDS in countries were
  compiled in the process of making the end of 1999 estimates of HIV/AIDS. These
  data came primarily from the HIV/AIDS Surveillance Database developed by the
  United States Census Bureau, from a database maintained by the European Centre
  for the Epidemiological Monitoring of AIDS and all country reports on sentinel
  surveillance that had been provided to World Health Organization or UNAIDS.
  Procedures were developed to score quality of surveillance systems based on
  four dimensions of quality: timeliness and frequency; appropriateness of
  groups; consistency of sites over time; and coverage provided by the system. In
  total, the surveillance systems from 167 countries were analysed. Results:
  Forty-seven of the 167 countries whose surveillance systems were rated were
  judged to have fully implemented sentinel surveillance systems; 51 were judged
  to have systems that had some or most aspects of a good HIV surveillance system
  in place and 69 were rated as having poorly functioning or non-existent
  surveillance systems. Conclusion: This analysis suggests that the quality of
  HIV surveillance varies considerably. The majority of countries most affected
  by HIV/AIDS have systems that are providing sufficient sero-prevalence data for
  tracking the epidemic and making reasonable estimates of HIV prevalence.
  However, many countries have poor systems and strengthening these is an urgent
  priority.

AB: We compared the cost effectiveness of enzootic arbovirus surveillance in
  northern California by antibody detection in sentinel chickens, virus isolation
  from mosquitoes, and antibody detection in wild avian hosts. Total and annual
  recurring costs were determined for each method based on estimated personnel
  and actual material and travel costs for biweekly surveillance at 3 sites in
  the Sacramento Valley from May 1 through mid-October 1997 and 1998. Serologic
  detection of antibodies in wild birds was the most expensive method. Total
  costs associated with sentinel chickens and mosquitoes combined were less than
  half of those for the wild bird program. Recurring annual costs for the wild
  bird and mosquito methods were only slightly less than expenses for those
  methods during the 1st year of operation, which included nonrecurring setup
  costs. Recurring costs for sentinel chickens were reduced apprx40% from total
  costs during the 1st year of the program and were <14% of recurring costs for
  wild bird serology. Exceptions and caveats of our analysis are discussed. When
  considering data from a companion paper on detection of enzootic virus
  transmission using the 3 methods, we concluded that the current system that
  combines sentinel chickens and virus isolation from mosquitoes is the most cost
  -effective and efficient surveillance program and should be retained. Future
  research efforts should investigate the costs and surveillance efficiency of
  modifications in the frequency of specimen collection and the placement of
  chicken flocks and mosquito traps.

AB: The effects of Cu and Cd on functional responses of hemocytes in Tapes
  philippinarum, a Veneridae clam widespread in the lagoon of Venice, were
  evaluated. Bivalves were exposed for 7 days to various concentrations of
  CuCl2cntdot2H2O (0, 10, 60, and 110 mug/L) and CdCl2cntdotH2O (0, 150, 300, and
  450 mug/L). Hemocytes were collected from exposed clams, and the effects of Cu
  and Cd on phagocytosis, Neutral Red retention capacity, superoxide dismutase,
  and cytochrome oxidase activities were investigated. Hemocytes from animals
  exposed to Cu showed a significant decrease in phagocytic activity, whereas no
  inhibition was observed in cells from Cd-exposed animals. Diffusion of Neutral
  Red into the cytosol, an index of lysosomal membrane alteration, was enhanced
  by high concentrations of both metals. Different results in biochemical
  parameters were observed. Exposure to 60 and 110 mug Cu/L caused a significant
  reduction in hemocyte superoxide dismutase activity, whereas no changes
  resulted after Cd exposure. Increased cytochrome oxidase activity was observed
  in hemocytes from mollusks exposed to 60 mug Cu/L and 300 mug Cd/L; no
  significant differences were found in cells from bivalves exposed to 110 mug
  Cu/L and 450 mug Cd/L. These results suggest a relationship between heavy metal
  exposure and alterations in functional responses of hemocytes in T.
  philippinarum and indicate that the type of observed effects vary with the
  nature and concentration of heavy metals. Moreover, the data obtained in the
  analyzed clam support the possibility of using it as sentinel organism in
  biomonitoring studies, even if used biomarkers will be further evaluated in
  field conditions.

AB: A rapid microtitre cell enzyme immuno assay (cell-EIA) was developed for the
  detection of influenza A subtypes in nasopharyngeal (NPS) swabs taken for
  surveillance. During the 1997/1998 influenza season in the United Kingdom, cell
  -EIA was compared to cell culture for the detection and typing of influenza A
  viruses in NPS obtained by sentinel general practitioners in community
  surveillance. The cell EIA can also be used to detect different influenza A
  subtypes (H3N2, H1N1, H5N3, H5N1, H7N7, and H9N2) and was used as a rapid
  detection assay for the screening of individuals returning from Hong Kong with
  influenza-like illness suspected to be due to H5N1 in 1997/98, providing a
  rapid, efficient, inexpensive method for the screening of influenza A cases
  during an outbreak or pandemic situation. The cell-EIA results reflected the
  results obtained by traditional virus culture within the age distribution of
  samples, clinical symptoms, and time between date of illness onset and sampling
  of cases, indicating its usefulness in surveillance of human and non-human
  influenza viruses. During two outbreaks of influenza in schools, Directigen(c)
  Flu-A, a near patient test, the cell-EIA, and tissue culture were compared. The
  cell-EIA gave higher sensitivity and specificity (74% and 90%) than
  Directigen(c) Flu-A (65% and 84.6%) in comparison with cell culture.

AB: Purpose: To revise the staging system for cutaneous melanoma under the
  auspices of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC). Materials and
  Methods: The prognostic factors analysis described in the companion publication
  (this issue), as well as evidence from the published literature, was used to
  assemble the tumor-node-metastasis criteria and stage grouping for the melanoma
  staging system. Results: Major changes include (1) melanoma thickness and
  ulceration but not level of invasion to be used in the T category (except for
  T1 melanomas); (2) the number of metastatic lymph nodes rather than their gross
  dimensions and the delineation of clinically occult (ie, microscopic) versus
  clinically apparent (ie, macroscopic) nodal metastases to be used in the N
  category; (3) the site of distant metastases and the presence of elevated serum
  lactic dehydrogenase to be used in the M category; (4) an upstaging of all
  patients with stage I, II, and III disease when a primary melanoma is
  ulcerated; (5) a merging of satellite metastases around a primary melanoma and
  in-transit metastases into a single staging entity that is grouped into stage

AB: Background: Radioguided-surgery has been recently proposed in patients with
  clinically occult breast lesions. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility
  of correctly locating and eradicating, by a single intralesional injection of a
  radiotracer, any breast lesion and, in the case of malignancy, to perform
  simultaneous sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy procedure. Patients and Methods:
  Sixty-three women with early breast lesions were enrolled: 42 were invasive
  carcinomas, 16 in situ ductal carcinomas (DCIS) and 5 fibroadenomas. Results:
  Scintigraphic images clearly identified the lesions in all patients while SLNs
  were evident in 88% of them. At surgery all the breast lesions were easily
  radiolocalized and eradicated with minimum surgical trauma and, for those
  patients with invasive carcinomas, the SLN technique was performed in 86% of
  them. No skip metastases were found. Conclusion: A single intralesional
  administration of radiotracer is an easy and reliable procedure to
  simultaneously locate and remove both the non-palpable breast lesion and the
  SLN when primary malignancy was intraoperatively confirmed.

AB: I studied the existence of sentinels in Saltator atricollis in a 'campo
  -cerrado' (Brazilian savanna) during the breeding seasons of 1994-95 and 1995
  -96. Groups of this species consisted of two to seven birds (N = 25). Sentinels
  were present (mean +- sd) 62% +- 9% of the time, and most sentinel bouts lasted
  from less than one to six minutes (although in some occasions for more than 30
  min.). Overlap of two or more sentinels occurred on average only 3.2% of the
  time with birds on guard. Sentinels commonly gave contact calls in the
  beginning and/or at the end of a sentinel bout. The group size had no effect on
  time with sentinels. However the encounter rate between raptors and groups
  significantly influenced the time guarded. The results of this study suggests
  that the ability of sentinels to detect predators may play a central role as an
  anti-predator device.

AB: With the aim of developing biomarkers of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon
  (PAH) genotoxicity for biomonitoring of the marine environment; the formation
  of DNA adducts and oxidative DNA damage was studied in the sentinel organism
  Mytilus. Mussels M. galloprovincialis were exposed for 21 d to different doses
  of benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) (50 and 100 mg B(a)P kg-1 dry wt mussel d-1) via
  trophic intake. The kinetics of B(a)P concentration in whole mussel tissues was
  determined in both groups, and a dose-response study was conducted for both
  gill B(a)P-related DNA adducts and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8
  -oxodGuo) formation in gill and digestive gland DNA. Exposure was followed by a
  10 d deputation period to study mussel recovery. Although B(a)P was absorbed
  and bioaccumulated to very high concentrations (>300 mg B(a)P kg-1 dry wt
  mussel), plateau values were not reached in either assay group. Regardless of
  the exposure dose of B(a)P, several bulky DNA adducts were induced in the
  typical PAH diagonal radioactive zone. For both doses, positive correlations
  were found between total DNA adduct level and both exposure time and B(a)P
  concentration in whole mussel tissues. DNA repair during deputation differed
  among the B(a)P-induced DNA adducts. B(a)P exposure had no effect on gill 8
  -oxodGuo levels, but led to a significant dose-dependent increase in the number
  of oxidative lesions in mussel digestive gland DNA. The decrease with
  depuration in digestive gland 8-oxodGuo levels to control values was indicative
  of the mussels' ability to recover from oxidative DNA damage.

AB: The axillary sentinel node biopsy has emerged recently as a most useful
  procedure to stage patients with small primary breast carcinomas and clinically
  uninvolved axillary nodes, and to guide therapy with minimal morbidity. Indeed,
  the histological examination of axillary sentinel nodes is highly predictive of
  the nonsentinel axillary node status and may spare axillary clearing in
  patients with histologically uninvolved sentinel nodes. To avoid the need for
  two separate surgical sessions the results of sentinel node examination may be
  known intraoperatively. Routine frozen section examination of sentinel nodes,
  however, is liable to yield false-negative results. An extensive intraoperative
  examination of frozen sentinel nodes, which would attain a sensitivity
  comparable to that obtained by routine histological analysis, has been
  therefore devised. To facilitate the detection of micrometastatic disease in
  the sentinel nodes, immunocytochemical and molecular biology techniques can be
  adopted. Indeed, the identification of specific epithelial antigens or mRNA
  markers may be useful adjuncts to the histological examination of the sentinel
  nodes.

AB: Axillary dissection provides important prognostic information and maintains
  local control in the axilla, but is not generally felt to contribute to the
  cure of breast cancer. Sentinel node biopsy has the potential to accurately
  identify node-negative women, allowing axillary dissection to be limited to
  women with positive nodes who are likely to benefit from the procedure.
  However, whether complete dissection is needed when a positive sentinel node is
  identified is uncertain, and this issue is being addressed in a clinical trial.
  Sentinel node biopsy has also raised the possibility of improving the staging
  of breast cancer through the detection of micrometastasis. At present, the
  prognostic significance of small cell clusters detected by immunohistochemistry
  is uncertain, and definitive information should be forthcoming from ongoing
  clinical trials. Better stratification of prognostic groups has the potential
  to allow the more selective use of adjuvant systemic therapy.

AB: The development of cancer screening has led to the discovery of smaller
  tumours and less frequent dissemination to lymph nodes and organs that requires
  special techniques for detection. Numerous papers on micrometastases reflect a
  considerable amount of work devoted to detection methods, technical problems
  and the prognostic value of these lesions. Apart from cytological techniques,
  the pathologist can rely on two methods for the detection of micrometastases:
  serial slicing of paraffin-embedded blocks and immunohistochemistry. When these
  methods are combined, the detection rate is similar to that of biological
  methods and can attain levels as high as 60% for the sentinel node with the
  added vantage of being able to visualise cells. Despite an impressive body of
  studies, major disparities are found in detection rates and the prognostic
  value of micrometastases is not firmly established. In order to facilitate
  comparisons and analyses, it is essential to adopt a common terminology with
  precise definitions. The UICC advocates the use of the term micrometastasis
  which denotes a metastasis smaller than or equal to 2 mm in size. The potential
  aggressiveness of micrometastases is dependent on other poorly explored
  parameters such as the number of cells detected in the bone marrow or lymph
  node and the location of micrometastases. The new pTNM classification takes
  into account this latter parameter and distinguishes two categories of
  micrometastases: "isolated tumor cells" located in the lumen of vessels or
  sinuses and "micrometastasis" which has already invaded an organ. This
  classification warrants further analysis to determine the prognostic value of
  these categories. The next challenging problem consists in determining the key
  biological properties that account for distant dissemination.

  localization wire for use in breast cancer patients undergoing nodal staging. A
  hollow wire having an anchoring hook at the distal end is inserted into the
  breast tissue through a loading needle. The anchoring hook, through spring
  action upon release from the loading needle, is embedded in the breast tissue
  near the location of cancerous cells. The loading needle is then removed and
  radioactive material may be injected into the tissue through perforations in
  the localization wire without leaving the needle in the patient or without
  reinserting the needle. A syringe attachment may be affixed to the proximal end
  of the hollow wire to facilitate the injection of radioactive material and blue
  dye for localizing the sentinel lymph node.

AB: Aims: To evaluate in detail the extent to which step sectioning and
  immunohistochemical examination of sentinel lymph nodes (SNs) in patients with
  breast cancer reveal additional node positive patients, to arrive at a
  sensitive yet workable protocol for histopathological SN examination. Methods:
  This study comprised 86 women with one or more positive SN after a successful
  SN procedure for clinical stage T1-T2 invasive breast cancer. SNs were
  lamellated into pieces of approximately 0.5 cm in size. One initial
  haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained central cross section was made for each
  block. When negative, four step ribbons were cut at intervals of 250 mum. One
  section from each ribbon was stained with H&E, and one was used for
  immunohistochemistry (IHC). Results: When taking the cumulative total of
  detected metastases at level 5 as 100%, the percentage of SN positive patients
  increased from 80%, 83%, 85%, 87% to 88% in the H&E sections through levels 1
  to 5, and with IHC these values were 86%, 90%, 94%, 98%, and 100%. Three of
  nine patients in whom metastases were detected at levels 3-5 only had
  metastases in the subsequent axillary lymph node dissection. Conclusions:
  Multiple level sectioning of SNs (five levels at 250 mum intervals) and the use
  of IHC detects additional metastases up to the last level. Although more levels
  of sectioning might increase the yield even further, this protocol ensures a
  reasonable workload for the pathologist with an acceptable sensitivity when
  compared with the published literature.

AB: Accurate diagnosis of micrometastases in sentinel lymph nodes of cutaneous
  melanoma is critical for proper clinical management. S-100 protein and HMB-45
  are the traditional immunomarkers widely used for this purpose. However, the
  interpretation of micrometastases by these markers is difficult with
  significant reduction in the diagnostic accuracy. S-100 protein demonstrates
  immunoreactivity for other nonmelanoma cells and obscures nuclear details,
  which are crucial for the interpretation of single cell metastases. We compared
  the new melanoma markers, Melan-A (clone A103) and MART-1 (clone M2-7C10), with
  S-100 protein and HMB-45, by examining 77 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
  sections of sentinel lymph nodes from 13 cases of primary cutaneous melanoma.
  CD68 (PG-M1) and hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections were also studied. Four
  pathologists interpreted the staining pattern after concealing the identity of
  each immunomarker. Az values (area under receiver operating characteristic
  curve) with receiver operating characteristic curve were higher with Melan-A
  (0.9742) and MART-1 (0.9779) compared with S-100 protein (0.8034) and HMB-45
  (0.8651), demonstrating a higher diagnostic accuracy with Melan-A and MART-1
  with superior detection of melanoma micrometastases. Melan-A and MART-1 showed
  sharp cytoplasmic immunoreactivity, almost exclusively restricted to the
  melanoma cells. Therefore, Melan-A and MART-1 are recommended for the
  evaluation of micrometastases in sentinel lymph nodes of cutaneous melanoma as
  a routine alternative to S-100 protein and HMB-45.

AB: Cells of the dendritic family are suited to perform two distinct functions
  at two discrete locations. In the peripheral tissues, DC act as sentinels for
  "dangerous" antigens. They then migrate into the lymphoid organ, where they
  initiate activation of T lymphocytes which are specific for these antigens.
  During their migration, DC shift from an antigen-capturing-mode to a T cell
  sensitizing mode. In addition to switching on the immune response, subtypes of
  DC appear to influence the character of T cell differentiation, i.e. the
  Th1/Th2 balance.

AB: Dose response experiments were conducted to determine a range of sub-lethal
  concentrations of the carbamate insecticide carbaryl to L3 larvae of the brown
  lacewing (Micromus tasmaniae). The LC50 value was determined to be 0.07% active
  ingredient (700 ppm) at 48 hours. Pesticide exposure experiments were conducted
  using sub-lethal doses determined from LC50 calculations to assess the effect
  of carbaryl on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and glutathione S-transferase (GST)
  activities at 2 and 24 h (for AChE) and 10 hours (for GST) after the onset of
  exposure. GST activity was not significantly affected by exposure to carbaryl,
  but AChE activity was significantly depressed (P<0.001) within two hours of
  exposure, even at low concentrations of carbaryl. Acetylcholinesterase activity
  remained depressed 24 hours after exposure, indicating that this enzyme may be
  a useful biomarker of short-term insecticide exposure, if the brown lacewing is
  further developed as a sentinel species for demonstrating the presence of
  bioavailable organophosphorus pesticide contamination. Further experiments are
  needed to determine the length of time required for AChE activity to return to
  pre-exposure levels before this enzyme could be used as a biomarker of chronic
  exposure.

  cases (15.4%). In 24 of the 91 patients, SLN was positive for metastasis. In 13
  the 24 patients, only SLN provided evidence of lymph node metastasis. The
  sensitivity of SLN biopsy was 87.5%, the specificity was 100%. It had 100%
  positive predictability and 95.7% negative predictability of lymph node
  metastasis. The accuracy rate of intraoperative imprint cytology examination of
  SLN was 92.1%, with a false negative rate of 10.0% and a false positive rate of
  7.1%. The accuracy rate of frozen-section examination of SLN was 98.7% during
  operation, with a false negative rate of 5.0% but without false positive
  result. Immunohistochemical assay did not help demonstrate metastasis in SLN
  negative on routine pathologic examination. Conclusion: The SLN status can
  generally be a representation of axillary metastasis, SLNB is useful to
  determine the extent of axillary dessection in cN0 breast cancer patients.
  Methylene blue is as effective as patent blue-V in the identification of SLN.

AB: Objective To optimize the method of sentinel node identification and observe
  the influence of different incisions of sentinel node biopsy in breast cancer.
  Methods Sentinel node in 72 unselected patients with breast carcinoma was
  identified by using blue dye tracer injection. Of these, sentinel nodes were
  identified in 36 patients by an axillary lymphadenectomy incision (method A),
  and the rest were identified by an incision of mastectomy (method B). Results
  Sentinel nodes were identified in 60 patients (83%) and 18 patients had
  metastases in sentinel node. Of these 18, 6 (33%) had no other involved
  axillary status in these 60 patients. Identification rates of method A and B
  were 72% (26/36) and 94% (34/36), respectively (P < 0.05). Conclusion Sentinel
  node biopsy could be an accurate predictor of axillary status. The method has
  higher identification rate and is worth for further study.

AB: We examined patients' attitudes toward HIV testing in the setting of acute
  substance abuse treatment and determined the prevalence of offering routine on
  -site testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in inpatient state-funded
  detoxification centers in New England. Voluntary questionnaires were
  administered to patients (N=66 respondents) at the only two state-funded
  inpatient drug detoxification treatment centers in Rhode Island, and a
  telephone survey of all state-funded inpatient detoxification facilities across
  the New England area was conducted. In New England, 17/38 (44.7%) of all state
  -funded inpatient detoxification facilities did not routinely offer on-site HIV
  testing to clients. Of participants, 97% responded positively to the question,
  "Do you think HIV testing should be available to patients in drug
  detoxification facilities such as this one?" There were 89% who reported that
  they would cope "about the same" or "better" with receiving a positive HIV test
  result while in detoxification treatment versus elsewhere. The greatest number
  of participants ranked the Orasure(R) HIV test, an assay for HIV-1 transmucosal
  antibody, as the test they would most prefer while in drug treatment. However,
  59% of patients responded that the type of test offered would not make a
  difference in whether they chose testing. Most patients indicated that they
  would want to see a physician within a few days of a positive diagnosis of HIV
  infection. Despite the controversy surrounding the provision of HIV testing to
  patients in inpatient acute substance abuse treatment, HIV testing is desired
  among these patients provided that HIV clinical care is readily available.

  studies, a number of questions are still unsolved. The adequacy of research
  sources and the transmission of information to clinical practice through
  consistent and validated efficacy evidences are required to ensure the
  treatment quality. In this article the different specialist approaches and the
  main themes debated in the interdisciplinary approach to breast cancer are
  considered: the genetical risk factors, the role of diagnostic imaging, the
  mapping and assessment of sentinel lymph node, the role of nodal radiation
  therapy following mastectomy.

AB: A standardized model of Streptococcus suis type 2 infection in specific
  -pathogen-free piglets, housed in high-security barns, was used to compare the
  virulence of 3 French field strains of S. suis serotype 2 isolated from tonsils
  of a healthy pig (strain 65) or from diseased pigs (meningitis, strain 166', or
  septicemia, strain 24). In one of the 2 trials, 7-week-old pigs, in 3 groups of
  8, were inoculated intravenously with 2X108 colony-forming units of S. suis
  type 2. In each group, 1 uninfected animal was a sentinel. Eight animals were
  also used as negative control group. The experiment was repeated under similar
  conditions with strains 65 and 166'. Virulence differed markedly among these S.
  suis strains when clinical signs, zootechnical performances, lesions, and
  bacteriological data were analyzed. Strain 65 did not induce clinical signs in
  inoculated pigs. In contrast, pigs infected with the other 2 strains exhibited
  clinical signs and typical lesions of S. suis type 2 infections. Differences in
  virulence were also observed between the 2 virulent strains. Sentinel animals
  exhibited the same manifestations as those recorded in inoculated piglets.
  Results were similar in the second trial, indicating that under the present
  experimental conditions, results were reproducible. The standardized conditions
  described in this study could be a useful tool to further study about the S.
  suis infection.

  from the Japan coast and Uca vocans and Ocypode ceratophthalma, were examined
  electrophoretically for genetic variations in 13 enzymatic and one non
  -enzymatic protein comprising 17 loci. Most species were highly differentiated
  from each other (Nei's genetic distance, 0.29-1.63). The least genetic distance
  was found between M. japonicus and M. banzai, the genetic distinctiveness, of
  the two taxa being supported by three divergent loci with no common allele. The
  genetic relationships among Macrophthalmus species differed greatly from those
  inferred from morphological features, with a UPGMA tree suggesting that the sub
  -genus Macrophthalmus is polyphyletic.
