TI: HIV transmission through breastfeeding: problems and prevention.
AU: Ogundele-MO; Coulter-JBS
AD: Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Pembroke Place, Liverpool L3 5QA=
, UK.
SO: Annals-of-Tropical-Paediatrics. 2003, 23: 2, 91-106; 87 ref.
PY: 2003
LA: English
AB: The greatest burden of HIV infection in women and their children is
  disproportionately borne by the poorest countries, especially in sub-Saha=
ran
  Africa. Breast feeding is a major health-promoting factor for infants and
  children in developing countries but the risk of mother-to-child transmis=
sion
  (MTCT) of HIV by this route is challenging traditional practices and heal=
th
  policies in low-resource countries. Maternal and infant factors contribut=
ing to
  the risk of MTCT through breast feeding are still poorly understood and n=
ot
  well researched. Factors identified include: advanced clinical stages of
  infection in the mother; high maternal plasma HIV-1 load; presence of mas=
titis;
  and infant oral thrush. In many developing countries, international agenc=
ies
  are providing support and recommendations for preventing MTCT of HIV-1 by
  breast feeding. Preventive strategies supported by WHO/UNICEF and charita=
ble
  agencies in some sentinel centres in sub-Saharan Africa include routine
  antenatal voluntary counselling and testing (VCT), PCR testing of infants=
 of
  seropositive mothers at 6 weeks of age, various combinations of a shorten=
ed
  period (3-6 months) of exclusive breast feeding, perinatal administration=
 of
  antiretrovirals (ARV) such as nevirapine and provision of affordable and =
safe
  infant replacement feeds (presently given free by UNICEF in some centres)=
. Many
  problems, however, have hindered effective implementation of these
  interventions. In many poor communities, even where VCT facilities are
  available, acceptance of HIV testing is low because there is fear of
  stigmatization by the spouse, family or community and compliance with com=
plex
  drug regimens is therefore poor. Other problems include the exorbitant co=
st of
  antiretroviral drugs, inadequately resourced health care systems and
  unavailability or poor acceptance of safe breast milk alternatives. The r=
ate of
  mixed feeding is high and so the risk of MTCT is increased. Continued pro=
motion
  of exclusive breast feeding for at least 6 months, irrespective of HIV st=
atus,
  followed by a properly prepared, high energy, nutritious complementary di=
et,
  with the possibility of early weaning to an animal milk formula, still ap=
pears
  to be the most appropriate option for the poor in countries with high lev=
els of
  MTCT not deriving any benefit from the above strategies. While a longer p=
eriod
  of breast feeding would probably increase the risk of MTCT in vulnerable
  communities, a shorter duration would certainly increase infant morbidity=
 and
  mortality. Results of investigations of the efficacy of ARV for protectin=
g the
  infants of HIV-infected mothers during the breast feeding period are awai=
ted.

AB: To assess the efficiency of melanoma screening and prevention campaigns=
 in
  the Auvergne region (France), cases of melanoma have been recorded since =
1st
  June 1998. The epidemiological follow-up of melanoma was carried out usin=
g two
  sentinel networks; one involving the pathologists, and the other, the
  dermatologists of the region. Incidence was calculated using the capture
  -recapture method, by cross-matching the data supplied by both dermatolog=
ists
  and pathologists. Between June 1st 1998 and December 31st 2000, 363 cases=
 of
  melanoma were recorded. The crude incidence rate of melanoma per 100,000 =
person
  -years was 17.1 for all melanomas and 14.6 for invasive melanomas. These =
rates
  of incidence were higher than the estimated national rate of France, and =
were
  close to incidences found in countries of Northern Europe. This might be
  explained by an increase in screening for melanoma, by more precise estim=
ation
  of the incidence due to the capture-recapture method, or by geographic fa=
ctors
  (mountainous area). An answer may be provided by following the variation =
in
  time of incidence and thickness of melanomas; the increase in the number =
of
  thin (low Breslow index) melanomas corresponding with increased screening=

  might be explained if transmission of HCV by tattooing generally caused
  subclinical HCV seropositivity without the acute hepatitis syndrome. We
  reanalysed data from a prior seroepidemiological study of 626 consecutive
  patients who were unaware of their HCV serological status and whose risk
  factors were ascertained by interview of an internist. Separate multiple
  logistic regression models were developed to predict a history of the acu=

  hepatitis syndrome and HCV seropositivity. A history of injecting drug us=
e was
  strongly associated with both HCV seropositivity (adjusted odds ratio (AO=

  7.2; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.1-16.5) and a history of acute hepat=

  (AOR, 5.9; 95% CI, 2.5-13.8); whereas having a commercially applied tatto=

AB: The emergence of West Nile (WN) virus in New York and the surrounding a=
rea
  in 1999 prompted an increase in surveillance measures throughout the Unit=
ed
  States, including the screening of sentinel chicken flocks for antibodies=
. An
  enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of chicken
  immunoglobulin M (IgM) to WN virus was developed, standardized, and
  characterized as a rapid and sensitive means to detect WN viral antibodie=
s in
  sentinel flocks. Serum specimens from experimentally infected chickens we=
re
  analyzed by using this assay, and IgM was detected as early as 3 to 7 day=
s
  postinfection. Persistence of IgM varied from at least 19 to more than 61=
 days
  postinfection, which indicates the need to bleed sentinel flocks at least=
 every
  2 weeks for optimal results if this method is to be used as a screening t=
ool.
  The ELISA was compared to hemagglutination-inhibition and plaque reductio=
n
  neutralization tests and was found to be the method of choice when early
  detection of WN antibody is required. House sparrows and rock doves are
  potential free-ranging sentinel species for WN virus, and the chicken WN =
IgM
  -capture ELISA was capable of detecting anti-WN IgM in house sparrow seru=
m
  samples from laboratory-infected birds but not from rock dove serum sampl=
es.
  The chicken WN IgM-capture ELISA detected anti-WN antibodies in serum sam=
ples
  from naturally infected chickens. It also detected IgM in serum samples f=
rom
  two species of geese and from experimentally infected ring-necked pheasan=
ts,
  American crows, common grackles, and redwinged blackbirds. However, the t=
est
  was determined to be less appropriate than an IgG (IgY)-based assay for u=
se
  with free-ranging birds. The positive-to-negative ratios in the ELISA wer=
e
  similar regardless of the strain of WN viral antigen used, and only minim=
al
  cross-reactivity was observed between the WN and St. Louis encephalitis (=
SLE)
  IgM-capture ELISAs. A blind-coded serum panel was tested, and the chicken=
 WN
  IgM-capture ELISA produced consistent results, with the exception of one
  borderline result. A preliminary test was done to assess the feasibility =
of a
  combined SLE and WN IgM-capture ELISA, and results were promising.

AB: Three porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV)
  recombinants, generated by mutagenesis of an infectious cDNA clone of the
  Lelystad virus (LV) isolate, were tested for their safety and protective
  efficacy as potential PRRSV vaccines in pigs. Recombinant vABV688 contain=
s two
  amino acid substitutions in the minor structural protein GP2 resulting in
  improved growth on cell line CL2621; in recombinant vABV707 the region en=
coding
  the ectodomain of the major unglycosylated membrane protein M has been re=
placed
  by that of the murine lactate dehydrogenase-elevating arterivirus; recomb=
inant
  vABV746 lacks the six C-terminal amino acids of the nucleocapsid protein =
N.
  First, we determined the safety of these recombinant viruses by monitorin=
g the
  stability of the introduced mutations in 8-week-old pigs. We showed that =
the
  introduced genomic mutations were maintained throughout the viraemic peri=
od.
  Second, the protective efficacy of immunization with the recombinant viru=
ses
  against challenge with a homologous and a heterologous PRRSV strain was
  determined in two pigs and compared with the efficacy of vABV437, a virus
  derived from the parental LV cDNA. The viraemia in pigs immunized with th=
e
  recombinant viruses was reduced compared to pigs immunized with vABV437. =
In
  addition, the length of viraemia was reduced in the sentinel pigs that we=
re
  introduced into the groups immunized with vABV746, vABV688, and vABV707,
  however, all of the sentinel pigs became infected. Pigs immunized with vA=
BV707
  and vABV437 were protected against challenge with homologous virus LV-Ter
  Huurne and transmission of the latter virus. None of the immunized pigs w=
ere
  protected against heterologous challenge with the virulent US isolate SDS=
U=A373,
  but the vABV707- and vABV746-immunized pigs were protected against transm=
ission
  of this virus from challenged pigs. In conclusion, the obtained viral
  recombinants are interesting candidates to be further explored for their =
use as
  vaccines against PRRSV.

AB: Despite being the most common bacterial cause of infectious intestinal
  disease (IID) in England and Wales, UK, outbreaks of Campylobacter infect=
ion
  are rarely reported. However, data from the Campylobacter Sentinel Survei=
llance
  Scheme, which was launched in May 2000, suggested that outbreaks might be=
 more
  common than was previously suspected, since a high proportion of cases re=
ported
  other illness in the home or in the community at the same time as their
  illness. To identify factors that might lead to these apparent outbreaks,=
 the
  exposures of cases of C. jejuni infection reporting other illness, either=
 in
  the home or the community, were compared with those for cases not reporti=
ng
  other illness using case-case methodology. Linked data were available for=
 3489
  cases of C. jejuni infection reported during the first year of the survei=
llance
  scheme. Illness in the home was associated with consuming organic meats i=
n the
  winter, having contact with a pet suffering from diarrhoea or visiting a =
farm
  in the 2 weeks before the onset of symptoms. Illness in the community was
  associated with the consumption of foods in restaurants or drinking
  unpasteurized milk. Prevention of Campylobacter infection requires that b=
etter
  methods of outbreak detection and investigation are developed, which in t=
urn
  should lead to a better understanding of risk factors.

AB: Results of the Dutch laboratory surveillance of bacterial gastroenterit=
is
  between 1991 and 2001 are presented and compared with recent findings in
  general practices and in the community. Between 1996 and 2000, the mean a=
nnual
  number of faecal samples screened by sentinel laboratories was about 1000
  samples/100000 inhabitants, which is 4% of the estimated annual incidence=
 of
  gastroenteritis in the Dutch population. Campylobacter (36/100000 inhabit=
ants)
  and Salmonella (24/100000 inhabitants) were the main pathogens isolated. =
Since
  1996, the incidence of laboratory confirmed salmonellosis decreased by 30=
%,
  predominantly among young children. The incidence of campylobacteriosis w=
as
  highest in urban areas and Salmonella enteritidis emerged as the predomin=
ant
  serotype in urban areas. Between 1991 and 2001, multiresistant S. typhimu=
rium
  DT104 emerged to comprise up to 15% of all Salmonella isolates in 2001.
  Reported incidence rates of Shigella spp. and Yersinia spp. infections va=
ried
  little, with average annual incidences of 3.2 and 1.2 cases/100000 inhabi=

AB: Background: Schistosomiasis is a major parasitic disease, increasingly
  imported into temperate climates by immigrants from and travellers to end=
emic
  areas. Method: To generate valid data on imported infectious diseases to =
Europe
  and to recognize trends over time, the European Network on Imported Infec=
tious
  Diseases Surveillance (TropNetEurop) was founded in 1999. Three hundred a=
nd
  thirty-three reports of schistosomiasis were analysed for epidemiological=
 and
  clinical features. Results: Male patients accounted for 64% of all cases.=
 The
  average age of all patients was 29.5 years. The majority of patients were=
 of
  European origin (53%). Europeans travelled predominantly for tourism (52%=
).
  Main reasons for travel for people from endemic areas were immigration an=
d
  refuge (51%) and visits to relatives and friends (28%). The majority of
  infections were acquired in Africa; 92 infections were clearly attributab=
le to
  Schistosoma haematobium, 130 to Schistosoma mansoni, and 4 to Schistosoma
  intercalatum. Praziquantel was the only treatment used. No deaths were
  recorded. Conclusion: TropNetEurop sentinel provides valuable epidemiolog=
ical
  and clinical data on imported schistosomiasis to Europe.

  morbidity and mortality. Measles cases reported from 1992 through 2001 we=
re
  obtained from the Health Management Information System, and measles admis=
sions
  and deaths were assessed in six sentinel hospitals. Measles incidence dec=
lined
  by 39%, measles admissions by 60%, and measles deaths by 63% in the year
  following the campaigns, with impact lasting 15 to 22 months. Overall, 64=
% of
  measles cases were among children < 5 years of age, and 93% were among ch=
ildren
  _15 years old. The cost per child vaccinated was $0.86. Routine immunizat=
ion
  coverage remained low, at 61% in 2001. To eliminate measles in Uganda, ro=
utine
  immunization should be strengthened, campaigns should be conducted among =
those
  < 15 years of age, and nationwide case-based measles surveillance should =
be put
  in place.

  objectives to analyse operational and epidemiological coefficients, to de=

es is
  a hyperendemic city (prevalence of 16.2/10000 inhabitants and detection o=
f
  10.22/10000 inhabitants in 2000). The increase of detection in children u=
nder
  the age of 15 years is in contrast with the descending line of disease
  detection verified the year. Of the new cases, 14% had detectable incapac=
ity,
  indicating a delayed diagnosis and an occult prevalence. The implementati=
on of

  suggest that the intensification of the strategies of control through the=

AB: This two-year prospective hospital population-based study of candidaemi=
a is
  the first to be conducted in the UK. It was carried out on behalf on the
  British Society for Medical Mycology (BSMM) as part of the European
  Confederation of Medical Mycology (ECMM) epidemiological survey of candid=
aemia.
  Six hospitals in England and Wales acted as sentinel hospitals. Main outc=
ome
  measures were hospital population-based incidence and 30-day mortality. T=
here
  were 18.7 episodes of candidaemia per 100 000 finished consultant episode=
s or
  3.0/100 000 bed days and 45.4% cases occurred in intensive care unit (ICU=
)
  patients. Candida albicans was isolated in 64.7% of confirmed cases. The
  majority of isolates were sensitive to standard antifungal agents, includ=
ing
  fluconazole. The overall 30-day mortality was 26.4% and removal of the ce=
ntral
  venous catheter was associated with a significant reduction in mortality.=
 In
  conclusion, the incidence of candidaemia in England and Wales is similar =
to
  that of the USA, the majority of isolates remain sensitive to commonly us=
ed
  antifungal agents and mortality associated with this infection appears to=
 be
  falling.

AB: We conducted a field study to test if the addition of a pellet of S
  -methoprene (Altosid) to an ovitrap would affect oviposition by Aedes aeg=
ypti
  or Ochlerotatus notoscriptus [A. notoscriptus]. In 2 trials conducted nea=
r
  Cairns, Queensland, Australia, no significant difference (P > 0.05) was f=
ound
  in the number of eggs of A. aegypti or O. notoscriptus laid in ovitraps w=
ith or
  without a methoprene pellet. These results suggest that the addition of a=
n S
  -methoprene pellet to ovitraps or sentinel tyres could be employed to eli=
minate
  the risk of mosquito production by ovitrap surveys.

4 h
  after treatment in fipronil plots, significantly higher control of A.

AB: Incursions of Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus into northern Queensland=
 are
  currently monitored using sentinel pigs. However, the maintenance of thes=
e pigs
  is expensive, and because pigs are the major amplifying hosts of the viru=
s,
  they may contribute to JE transmission. Therefore, we evaluated a mosquit=
o
  -based detection system to potentially replace the sentinel pigs. Single,
  inactivated JE-infected Culex annulirostris and C. sitiens were placed in=
to
  pools of uninfected mosquitoes that were housed in a MosquitoMagnet Pro (=
MM)
  trap set under wet season field conditions in Cairns, Queensland, Austral=
ia for
  0, 7, or 14 days. JE viral RNA was detected (cycling threshold (CT)=3D40)=
 in
  11/12, 10/14, and 2/5 pools containing 200, 1000, and 5000 mosquitoes,
  respectively, using a TaqMan real-time reverse transcription-polymerase c=
hain
  reaction (RT-PCR). The ability to detect virus was not affected by the le=
ngth
  of time pools were maintained under field conditions, although the CT sco=
re
  tended to increase with field exposure time. Furthermore, JE viral RNA wa=
s
  detected in three pools of 1000 mosquitoes collected from Badu Island usi=
ng a
  MM trap. These results indicated that a mosquito trap system employing se=
lf
  -powered traps, such as the MosquitoMagnet, and a real-time PCR system, c=
ould
  be used to monitor for JE in remote areas.

  2001. An intensive mosquito trapping and surveillance programme was condu=

r
  mosquito traps, each with a single sentinel chicken, were placed at five
  different locations on each of four nights. A total of 11948 mosquitoes w=
as
  collected, and 14 mosquito pools were found to contain WN, giving a minim=
um
  infection rate between 1.08 and 7.54 per 1000. Only one of the 80 sentine=
l
  chickens seroconverted to WN, demonstrating a single mosquito transmissio=
n
  event during the study and a mosquito transmission rate of between 0.8 an=
d 1
  per 1000. Culex nigripalpus was responsible for WN transmission to the se=
ntinel
  chicken, although both C. nigripalpus and C. quinquefasciatus were found
  infected with WN. Mosquito transmission rates are reported in this study =
for
  the first time for a WN outbreak. This information is essential to determ=
ine
  risk of human and animal infection.

AB: Context: The USA recently implemented smallpox vaccination of selected
  military personnel in a national programme of preparedness against use of
  smallpox as a biological weapon. The resumption of smallpox vaccinations =
raises
  important questions regarding implementation and safety. Objective: To de=
scribe
  the US military smallpox vaccination programme. Design: Descriptive study=
 of
  the vaccination programme from its inception on 13 December 2002 through =
to 28
  May 2003. Setting: US Department of Defense (DoD) fixed and field medical
  treatment facilities on multiple continents and ships at sea. Subjects: U=
S
  service members and DoD civilian workers eligible for smallpox vaccinatio=
n.
  Main Outcome Measures: Numbers of vaccinations and rates of vaccination
  exemptions, symptoms, and adverse events. Data were collected via reports=
 to
  headquarters and rigorous surveillance for sentinel events. Results: In 5=
.5
  months, the DoD administered 450293 smallpox vaccinations (70.5% primary
  vaccinees and 29.5% revaccinees). In 2 settings, 0.5% and 3.0% of vaccine
  recipients, respectively, needed short-term sick leave. Most adverse even=
ts
  occurred at rates below historical rates. One case of encephalitis and 37=
 cases
  of acute myopericarditis developed after vaccination; all cases recovered=
.
  Among 19461 worker-months of clinical contact, there were no cases of
  transmission of vaccinia from worker to patient, no cases of eczema vacci=
natum
  or progressive vaccinia, and no attributed deaths. Conclusions: Mass smal=
lpox
  vaccinations can be conducted safely with very low rates of serious adver=
se
  events. Programme implementation emphasized human factors: careful staff
  training, contraindication screening, recipient education, and attention =
to
  bandaging. Our experience suggests that broad smallpox vaccination progra=
mmes
  may be implemented with fewer serious adverse events than previously beli=
eved.

AB: Context: In the USA, the annual incidence of myocarditis is estimated a=
t 1
  to 10 per 100000 population. As many as 1% to 5% of patients with acute v=
iral
  infections involve the myocardium. Although many viruses have been report=
ed to
  cause myopericarditis, it has been a rare or unrecognized event after
  vaccination with the currently used strain of vaccinia virus (New York Ci=
ty
  Board of Health). Objective: To describe a series of probable cases of
  myopericarditis following smallpox vaccination among US military service
  members reported since the reintroduction of vaccinia vaccine. Design, Se=
tting,
  Participants: Surveillance case definitions are presented. The cases were
  identified either through sentinel reporting to US military headquarters
  surveillance using the Defense Medical Surveillance System or reports to =
the
  Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System using International Classification=
 of
  Diseases, Ninth Revision. The cases occurred among individuals vaccinated=
 from
  mid-December 2002 to 14 March 2003. Main Outcome Measure: Elevated serum =
levels
  of creatine kinase (MB isoenzyme), troponin I, and troponin T, usually in=
 the
  presence of ST-segment elevation on electrocardiogram and wall motion
  abnormalities on echocardiogram. Results: Among 230734 primary vaccinees,=
 18
  cases of probable myopericarditis after smallpox vaccination were reporte=
d (an
  incidence of 7.8 per 100000 over 30 days). No cases of myopericarditis
  following smallpox vaccination were reported among 95622 vaccinees who we=
re
  previously vaccinated. All cases were white men aged 21 years to 33 years=
 (mean
  age, 26.5 years), who presented with acute myopericarditis 7 to 19 days
  following vaccination. A causal relationship is supported by the close te=
mporal
  clustering (7-19 days; mean, 10.5 days following vaccination), wide geogr=
aphic
  and temporal distribution, occurrence in only primary vaccinees, and lack=
 of
  evidence for alternative aetiologies or other diseases associated with
  myopericarditis. Additional supporting evidence is the observation that t=
he
  observed rate of myopericarditis among primary vaccinees is 3.6-fold (95%
  confidence interval, 3.33-4.11) higher than the expected rate among perso=
nnel
  who were not vaccinated. The background incidence of myopericarditis did =
not
  show statistical significance when stratified by age (20-34 years: 2.18
  expected cases per 100000; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.90-2.34), race
  (whites: 1.82 per 100000; 95% CI, 1.50-2.01), and sex (males: 2.28 per 10=
0000;
  95% CI, 2.04-2.54). Conclusion: Among US military personnel vaccinated ag=
ainst
  smallpox, myopericarditis occurred at a rate of 1 per 12819 primary vacci=
nees.
  Myopericarditis should be considered an expected adverse event associated=
 with
  smallpox vaccination. Clinicians should consider myopericarditis in the
  differential diagnosis of patients presenting with chest pain 4 to 30 day=
s
  following smallpox vaccination and be aware of the implications as well a=
s the
  need to report this potential adverse advent.

AB: Objective: To identify the most common avoidable factors, missed
  opportunities and substandard care in perinatal care in South Africa. Set=
ting:
  Seventy-three state hospitals throughout South Africa representing metrop=
olitan
  areas, cities and towns, and rural areas. Method: Users of the Perinatal
  Problem Identification Programme (PPIP) amalgamated their data to provide
  descriptive information on the causes of perinatal death and the avoidabl=
e
  factors, missed opportunities and substandard care in South Africa. Resul=
ts: A
  total of 8085 perinatal deaths among babies weighing 1000 g or more were
  reported from 232718 births at the PPIP sentinel sites. Avoidable factors=
,
  missed opportunities and substandard care were reported to be patient-rel=
ated
  (between 31.5% and 47.5% of deaths), due to administrative problems (betw=
een
  10.1% and 31.1% of deaths), and due to health worker-related problems (be=
tween
  28.4% and 36.0% of deaths) in the metropolitan and rural areas respective=
ly.
  Figures for cities and towns lay between these ranges. Deaths due to
  intrapartum asphyxia and birth trauma were thought to be clearly preventa=
ble
  within the health system in 63.1%, 34.4% and 35.7% of cases in the metrop=
olitan
  areas, cities and towns, and rural areas respectively. Deaths due to
  hypertension and antepartum haemorrhage were thought to be clearly preven=
table
  within the health system in 18.7%, 15.4% and 20.0% of cases in the metrop=
olitan
  areas, cities and towns, and rural areas respectively. Far fewer preventa=
ble
  deaths were recorded in the spontaneous preterm labour category. Conclusi=
on:
  Concentration on the remediable priority problems identified (namely labo=
ur
  management, resuscitation of the asphyxiated neonate, and care of the pre=
mature
  neonate) makes the reduction of perinatal mortality in South Africa feasi=
ble
  and inexpensive.

AB: Yaws is no longer a national and international health priority for
  intervention, but there is still a negative perception of the disease in =
the
  few affected communities. A survey in 1988 in the northern region of Ecua=
dor
  documented a prevalence of 16.5% of clinical cases and 96.3% of serologic=
al
  cases. A continuous, long-term community-based surveillance programme was
  therefore put in place focusing on yaws as one of the sentinel diseases. =
The
  results of this intervention are reported here. In 1993, a second survey =
showed
  a reduction in the prevalence of clinical cases to 1.4% and of serologica=
l
  cases to 4.7%. Between 1993 and 1998, no other clinical cases were detect=
ed and
  the serological prevalence in 1998 was 3.5%, corresponding with clinical =
cases
  of primary or congenital syphilis, latent yaws under follow-up, and indiv=
iduals
  with low serological titres indicating a 'serological scar'. These data
  indicate that yaws has been eliminated. Another important outcome of the
  intervention is the increased self-confidence in the communities that hea=
lth
  problems can be tackled.

  aged less than 35 years were included in the study: those having a first
  consultation for pregnancy and those having a routine check-up. Results: =
A
  total of 1589 women were tested for C. trachomatis. The prevalence among
  pregnant women (n=3D817) was 1.3%, and that among sexually active women (=
n=3D772)
  was 2.8%. Using the prevalences observed among check-up women, we estimat=
e that
  there were at least 24,400 C. trachomatis infections in Switzerland among=
 women
  aged 20 to 34 years in 1998 (95% CI: 14,300-34,300). The number of labora=
tory
  reports of C. trachomatis in this age group was 1150 in 1998. Conclusion:=
 Our
  study suggests that the sensitivity of national laboratory reports of C.
  trachomatis in 1998 was less than 5% for women aged 20 to 34 years.

AB: The determination of field inactivation rates of Cryptosporidium oocyst=
s in
  sludge and soil is important as many land applications use sludge as a me=
ans of
  fertilizing the soil. Approximately 2.5 x 105 oocysts were spiked into se=
parate
  sentinel chambers containing a 1.0 g mixture of sludge and soil. The sent=
inel
  chambers were exposed to the soil surface environment for 60 days at a de=
pth of
  10 cm in order to evaluate the field inactivation rates of oocysts. The m=
ass
  balance approach was used to determine the number of oocysts lost in the
  experiments. The results of the study showed that oocysts could survive
  environmental stress in soil. The mean inactivation rate of oocysts in th=
e
  sentinel chambers at time intervals of 0 to 17 days, 17 to 30 days, 30 to=
 45
  days, and 45 to 60 days were 0.0045, 0.0033, 0.0043, and 0.012 day-1,
  respectively. Whereas, the mean inactivation rates of oocysts in control =
units
  at time intervals of 0 to 17 days, 17 to 30 days, 30 to 45 days, and 45 t=
o 60
  days were 0.0023, 0.0019, 0.0017, and 0.0025 day-1, respectively. An aver=
age of
  4.8 percent of oocysts were lost in the experiments. Overall, the study
  demonstrated the presence of viable oocysts in sludge samples, which coul=
d
  potentially be used to fertilize agricultural land.

AB: Several studies in sub-Saharan Africa have reported that HIV prevalence=
 in
  young women is higher than in young men. We used data from Kenya HIV sent=
inel
  surveillance conducted from 1990 to 2001 among sexually transmitted disea=
se
  (STD) patients (15-49 years old) to investigate consistency of gender
  differentials over time and their risk factors. Of the 15889 STD patients=
, the
  HIV prevalence ranged from 16.0% in 1990 to 41.8% in 1997. The odds ratio=
s
  (ORs) of HIV infection for women compared to men decreased by age; women =
15-24
  years were nearly twice as likely as men of the same ages to be HIV infec=
ted
  (OR, 1.7; 95% CI: 1.5-2.0), but risk in those > 44 years was almost equal=
 (OR,
  0.8; 95% CI: 0.7-1.2). The odds of HIV infection for women compared to me=
n were
  twice in unmarried patients (OR, 2.1; 95% CI: 1.8-2.3). This association
  persisted after controlling for age groups or marital status, residence, =
level
  of education and presence of STD syndromes. This pattern had been consist=
ent
  over 12 years. It is suggested that adolescent women with symptoms of STD=
s
  should be a focus for the HIV/STD intervention programmes because of thei=
r high
  risk for HIV.

  a more comprehensive picture of the HIV epidemic than any one source alon=

  dominated by men who have sex with men to one where more than half of new

 HIV

  policy. In particular, these data have been used to support the developme=
nt of
  an HIV testing program in pregnancy, to re-direct community work toward
  injection drug users and the young, and to demonstrate the effectiveness =
of new

AB: Objective: To examine the progress made towards the Safe Motherhood
  Initiative goals in 3 areas of the United Republic of Tanzania during the
  1990s. Methods: Maternal mortality in the United Republic of Tanzania was
  monitored by sentinel demographic surveillance of more than 77000 women o=
f
  reproductive age, and by prospective monitoring of mortality in an urban =
site,
  a wealthier rural district, and a poor rural district. The rural district=
s were
  observed between 1992 and 1999, while the urban site was observed between=
 1993
  and 1999. Findings: During the period of observation, the proportion of d=
eaths
  of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) due to maternal causes (PMDF)
  compared with all causes was between 0.063 and 0.095. Maternal mortality =
ratios
  (MMRatios) were 591-1099 and maternal mortality rates (MMRates; maternal =
deaths
  per 100000 women aged 15-49 years) were 43.1-123.0. MMRatios in surveilla=
nce
  areas were substantially higher than estimates from official, facility-ba=
sed
  statistics. In all areas, the MMRates in 1999 were substantially lower th=
an at
  the start of surveillance (1992 for rural districts, 1993 for the urban a=
rea),
  although trends during the period were statistically significant at the 9=
0%
  level only in the urban site. At the community level, an additional year =
of
  education for household heads was associated with a 62% lower maternal de=
ath
  rate, after controlling for community-level variables such as the proport=
ion of
  home births and occupational class. Conclusion: Educational level was a m=
ajor
  predictor of declining MMRates. Even though rates may be decreasing, they
  remained high in the study areas. The use of sentinel registration areas =
may be
  a cost-effective and accurate way for developing countries to monitor mor=
tality
  indicators and causes, including for maternal mortality.

AB: There is an urgent need for behavioural surveillance and prevention
  strategies specifically designed for men who have sex with men (MSM) who
  exhibit high-risk behaviour. This report describes a sentinel screening
  programme designed to identify sexually transmitted infections among
  incarcerated MSM. 2087 inmates (aged 25-44 years) were screened for HIV,
  syphilis, gonorrhoea and Chlamydia infection from a segregated unit of me=
n who
  have sex with men in Los Angeles County Men's Central Jail, Los Angeles,
  California, USA, from March 2000 to January 2002. A convenience sample of=
 217
  participants was offered a survey to assess risk behaviours. Screening
  activities identified 12.4% HIV, 3.1% Chlamydia, 1.5% gonorrhoea and 0.3%=
 early
  syphilis infections. The high HIV prevalence found in this population ind=
icates
  the opportunity for HIV prevention within sexually transmitted disease (S=
TD)
  screening of incarcerated MSM. Bridging HIV prevention into STD screening=
 will
  require the integration of primary and secondary prevention services with=
in the
  jail including case management, early treatment and referral services.

AB: Background: Chlamydia trachomatis infection rates in Alabama increased
  dramatically from 1996 to 1998, due in part to expanded screening. Detect=
ion of
  prevalent infection through increased testing could mask timely detection=
 of
  the impact of screening programs on community prevalence. Goal: The goal =
of the
  study was to evaluate the temporal trend in C. trachomatis prevalence amo=
ng
  women aged 15 to 34 years attending reproductive healthcare clinics in
  Birmingham, Alabama. Study Design: Between 1995 and 1998, systematic scre=
ening
  of the first 60 women presenting each month to each of six participating
  clinics was performed with urine-based testing for chlamydia. Results: In
  contrast to the 218% increase in chlamydia prevalence detected through pa=
ssive
  surveillance, during the study period surveillance in sentinel sites reve=
aled
  that first-visit chlamydia prevalence declined from 12.8% to 8.6%. Conclu=
sions:
  Sentinel site surveillance served as a valuable adjunct to passive survei=
llance
  for determining the true trend of chlamydia prevalence during the hyperen=
demic
  phase of a local epidemic.

AB: The surveillance of pneumococcal antibiotic resistance and serotype
  distribution is hampered by the relatively low numbers of invasive pneumo=
coccal
  infections. In Switzerland, a nationwide sentinel surveillance network wa=
s used
  to assess antibiotic resistance and serotype distribution among 1179
  pneumococcal isolates cultured from 2769 nasopharyngeal swabs obtained fr=
om
  outpatients with acute otitis media or pneumonia during 1998 and 1999. Th=
e
  proportion of penicillin-susceptible pneumococcal isolates overall (87%) =
and
  among infants < 2 years old (81%) was comparable to that of invasive isol=
ates
  (90% and 81%, respectively). The high number of nasopharyngeal isolates a=
llowed
  for the detection of a rapid increase in the number of penicillin
  -nonsusceptible pneumococcal (PNSP) strains in the West region of Switzer=
land,
  partly because of an epidemic caused by the 19F clone of Streptococcus
  pneumoniae. Clustering of risk factors for the carriage of PNSP isolates
  further explained the geographic variation in resistance rates. The natio=
nwide
  sentinel surveillance of nasopharyngeal pneumococcus proved to be valuabl=
e for
  the monitoring of antibiotic resistance, risk factors for carriage of PNS=
P
  isolates, and serotype distribution and for the detection of the emergenc=
e of a
  new epidemic clone.

AB: The first reported cases of HIV-1 infection in South Africa occurred in
  1982. Two distinct HIV-1 epidemic patterns were recognized. Initially the
  infection was prevalent in white males who had sex with males. The HIV-1 =
clade
  B was associated with this group. By 1989, the second epidemic was recogn=
ized
  primarily in the black population. Infections in this case were mainly
  heterosexual in origin. The HIV-1 clade involved was mainly C. The nation=
al HIV
  -1 sero-prevalence in antenatal attendees was less than 1% in 1990 and by=
 1994
  this figure had risen to 7.5%. The most recent antenatal surveillance for=
 HIV-1
  sero-prevalence in 1999 revealed the following. The national prevalence r=
ate
  for 1999 was 22.4% compared with the 1998 rate of 22.8%. The data highlig=
hted
  the profound effect the epidemic had and will have on the disease burden =
in
  South Africa and by extension on the social and economic fronts. This vie=
w was
  emphasised by the impact HIV-1 infection had on tuberculosis. For example=
,
  sentinel surveys have attributed 44% of tuberculosis cases to HIV-1 infec=
tion.
  Moreover, the high prevalence of sexually transmitted infections will cer=
tainly
  exacerbate the HIV-1 epidemic.

AB: Objective: The objective of the present review is to assess the impact =
of
  universal salt iodination in Nigeria during the last five years, with ref=
erence
  to some of the sentinel sites studied previously during a 1995 multicentr=
e
  study. Design, setting and subjects: The method of goitre classification =
by
  palpation was employed using the new internationally accepted method in w=
hich
  the classification is simply graded as 0, 1 or 2. The multistage random
  sampling method was used, and state and local government areas were alrea=
dy
  selected by virtue of their known status for iodine deficiency disorders =
(IDD).
  Schools were randomly chosen in each local government area and children a=
ged 8
  -12 years in each school were determined. A percentage of the children wa=
s then
  included in the study to give a sample size greater than the minimum numb=
er
  allotted to the school. A total of 2372 school children (1420 males and 9=
52
  females) in 11 local government areas were examined; urine samples were
  collected from 537 children and analysed for urinary excretion of iodine.=
 The
  method known as the Sandell-Kolthoff reaction was adopted, in which the i=
odide
  in the urine samples catalyses the reduction of ceric ammonium sulfate (y=
ellow
  colour) to the cerous form (colourless) in the presence of arsenious acid=
. The
  degree of reduction in colour intensity of the yellow ceric ammonium sulf=
ate is
  proportional to the iodine content in the urine sample. Results: The medi=
an
  urinary iodine excretion for this sampled population in Nigeria, drawn mo=
stly
  from IDD-endemic areas, was 14.65 =B5g/dl with a mean value of 13.39 =B5g=
/dl.
  Conclusion: Results suggest that Nigeria, in general terms, has achieved =
the
  goal of universal salt iodination and should now focus its attention on
  constant monitoring to sustain this iodination level.

AB: Objectives: Estimates of the HIV/AIDS burden in Burma (Myanmar) are
  uncertain. Using data from the 1999 national HIV sentinel surveillance an=
d
  available population data, we generated estimates of Burma's HIV burden i=
n
  1999. Methodology: The 1999 sentinel surveillance included women attendin=
g
  antenatal clinics, male military recruits, blood donors, injecting drug u=
sers,
  patients of sexually transmitted disease clinics, and sex workers. We use=
d data
  for women attending antenatal clinics and male recruits aged 20-29 years =
to
  estimate HIV prevalence among women and men, respectively. Data points we=
re
  merged to give five regional estimates of prevalence for men and women. C=
ensus
  figures were used to obtain national population estimates of the numbers =
of
  Burmese living with HIV infection, along with confidence intervals (CIs).
  Results: HIV prevalence varied by region, with the lowest rates in the We=
st,
  intermediate rates in the central region, and highest rates in the North,=
 East,
  and South. The highest rates were in the East (Shan State), with female
  prevalence of 3.0% (95% CI, 1.9-4.5). The total number of infected women
  nationwide was 218,300 (95% CI, 159,400-277,100), and that of men was 468=
,700
  (95% CI, 343,300-594,200). We estimated HIV prevalence of at least 3.46% =
(95%
  CI, 2.72-4.19) among adults aged 15-44 years; 5700 infants were born with=
 HIV
  infection in 1999. Discussion: Burma has a generalized epidemic of HIV-1 =
in
  reproductive age adults. We estimated that there were 687,000 (95% CI, 54=
1,100
  -832,900) Burmese adults living with HIV infection in 1999, or about one =
of
  every 29 adult citizens. This estimate is higher than the UNAIDS estimate=
 for
  the same year of 530,000 adults and children living with AIDS, or a popul=
ation
  prevalence of about one in 50 adults. HIV prevention and care programs ar=
e
  urgently needed in Burma.

AB: There have been 5 confirmed cases of Murray Valley encephalitis virus (=
MVE)
  infection in the Alice Springs region (Northern Territory, Australia) dur=
ing
  the high rainfall years of 1999/00 and 2000/01, compared with one case in=
 the
  preceding 9 years. There also appeared to be an increased prevalence of R=
oss
  River virus (RR) infection in the Alice Springs and Tennant Creek regions
  associated with high rainfall. This paper presents an analysis of summer
  rainfall from 1990/91 to 2000/01, numbers of seroconversion of sentinel
  chickens to MVE, and RR cases in both regions. In Alice Springs where sum=
mer
  rainfall (December to February) and average vector numbers in the Decembe=
r to
  March period are closely correlated, the analysis also included mosquito =
vector
  numbers and MVE cases. Summer rainfall over 100 mm was significantly asso=
ciated
  with sentinel chicken seroconversions to MVE. From December to March ther=
e was
  also a significant association of average vector numbers (_300) with
  seroconversions in sentinel chickens following high summer rainfall. MVE
  appears enzootic in the Tennant Creek region and epizootic in the Alice S=
prings
  region. In Alice Springs during December to March, there was a significan=
t
  association of RR cases with rainfall over 100 mm and with average vector
  numbers over 300. There was also a significant correlation of summer rain=
fall
  with RR cases in Tennant Creek. Summer rainfall is a new and good early
  indicator of high risk for both MVE and RR disease in the Alice Springs
  locality and RR in the Tennant Creek locality. Although similar relations=
hips
  between rainfall and vector abundance, and disease incidence probably exi=
st in
  other areas of central Australia, rainfall and vector abundance threshold=
s will
  probably vary according to local climatic and environmental conditions.

  -based data including general practitioner sentinel surveillance,
  hospitalisation data, and death certificates from England and Wales were
  analysed. The average incidence rates for varicella and zoster between 19=
91 and
  2000 were 1291 and 373 per 100000 years, respectively. Overall hospitalis=
ation
  rates were equal for varicella and zoster (4.5 vs. 4.4 hospitalisation pe=
r
  100000 population) with 5 and 8%, respectively, having underlying
  immunosuppressive conditions. The age-specific proportion of cases hospit=
alised
  and length of stay were similar between the two diseases. However, the ov=
erall
  burden of disease is considerably higher for zoster. The number of inpati=
ent
  days and case-fatality due to zoster are roughly 4 to 6 times greater tha=
n for
  varicella (11 vs. 3 days and 25 vs. 4 deaths per 100000 case). These resu=

AB: Background: Sentinel surveillance of the antimicrobial resistance of
  Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains isolated from female sex workers in North
  Sumatra, Indonesia, has been carried out since 1975. In 1996 a high preva=
lence
  of N. gonorrhoeae strains with plasmid-mediated resistance to tetracyclin=
e and
  penicillin was observed. Goal: The goal was to further characterize N.
  gonorrhoeae strains isolated from a core group of patients in Indonesia w=
ith
  sexually transmitted infections in 1996. Study Design: The strains were
  characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, plasmid analysis,
  subtype of the tetM determinant, and analysis of genomic DNA by pulsed-fi=
eld
  gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Results: A total 161 N. gonorrhoeae strains
  obtained from 592 female sex workers in 10 different places in North Suma=
tra,
  Indonesia, in 1996 were investigated. All strains exhibited plasmid-media=
ted
  resistance to penicillin (PPNG: penicillinase-producing N. gonorrhoeae) a=
nd/or
  tetracycline (TRNG: tetracycline-resistant N. gonorrhoeae); 115 strains w=
ere
  PPNG/TRNG (71%), 45 were TRNG (28%), and 1 was PPNG. All strains were
  susceptible to ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, kanamycin, and spectinomycin. =
All
  PPNG strains tested carried the 7.2-kb (Asian type) plasmid except one, w=
hich
  carried the 4.9-kb (Toronto type) plasmid. All TRNG strains except one
  contained the Dutch-type tetM gene. PFGE analysis of 156 N. gonorrhoeae s=
trains
  documented that a diversity of strains existed and that certain genotypes=
 had
  spread in a defined area or between different areas in North Sumatra.
  Conclusion: Our results underline the importance of continuous surveillan=
ce of
  the changing patterns of antimicrobial resistance of N. gonorrhoeae in hi=
gh
  -risk populations.

 was
  undertaken to determine the frequency of reported risk factors and possib=

  transmission routes in individuals in whom HCV antibody (anti-HCV) was ne=
wly
  detected. Seven public health laboratories in England and Wales reported
  persons with positive anti-HCV tests over a 3-month period between 1 Nove=
mber
  1996 and 31 January 1997. A questionnaire was then sent to the clinician =
or
  general practitioner (GP) who requested the test. A total of 320 laborato=
ry
  reports were received from participating laboratories and 221 (69%)
  questionnaires were received from clinicians and GPs. Of those patients f=
rom
  whom a questionnaire was received (median age 36 years; males 72.9%, fema=
les
  23.1%), 86% had one or more risk factors for infection reported by the
  clinician/GP. Injecting drug use (68%) was the main risk factor reported.
  Reasons for testing included being in a known risk group (65%), liver dis=
ease
  (19%) and blood donation (1.4%). Of the total responders, 67% were
  asymptomatic, and of those that had had liver function tests 50% were abn=
ormal.
  The most prevalent HCV genotypes were 3a and 1a. Risk factors for HCV inf=
ection
  can be identified using a simple postal questionnaire to clinicians/GPs w=

AB: The movement of populations shapes the patterns and distribution of
  infectious diseases globally. The consequences of travel are seen in the
  traveller and in places and populations visited and may persist long afte=
r
  travel. The traveller can be seen as an interactive biological unit who p=
icks
  up, processes, carries and drops off microbial genetic material. A travel=
ler
  can introduce potential pathogens in the absence of signs or symptoms of
  illness. Travellers can serve as a sentinel population; study of them can
  provide insights into the presence and level of risk of transmission of
  infections in other geographical regions. Travellers can also be seen as
  couriers who inadvertently ferry pathogens and microbial genetic material=
 to
  regions where researchers can carry out detailed analyses that can help t=
o map
  the location and movement of strains, genotypes and resistance patterns. =
The
  laboratory plays a key role in the identification and characterization of
  pathogens, which can inform management of individual patients and the pub=
lic
  health response. The connectedness and mobility in the world today facili=
tate
  the emergence of infectious diseases in humans and also in animals and pl=
ants.
  Many traditional barriers have been breached by travel, roads and technol=
ogy.
  Population size and density favour spread of many infections. The rapid
  generation time of microbes and their capacity to adapt to changes in the
  physico-chemical and immunological environment will pose continuing chall=
enges.

  variously precursor avian H5N1 virus in geese and ducks, and H9N2 and H6N=
1
  viruses in quail, the quail possibly functioning as an avian 'mixing vess=
el'
  for key genetic reassortment events for onward transmission of H5N1 virus=
es
  highly pathogenic for chicken and humans. These findings highlight the
  importance of systematic virus surveillance of domestic poultry in recogn=
izing
  changes in virus occurrence, host range and pathogenicity as signals at t=
he
  avian level that could presage a pandemic. For example, there is now an
  increasing prevalence of avian influenza viruses in terrestrial (in contr=
ast to
  aquatic) poultry. Prior to 1997, no particular virus subtype other than H=
4N6
  would have been considered a candidate for pandemicity and this was based=
, in
  the absence of any other data, on its high frequency of occurrence in duc=
ks in
  southern China. Now, with the isolation of H5N1 and H9N2 viruses from hum=
ans
  supported by genetic, molecular and biological studies on these and other=
 avian
  isolates, there is credible evidence for the candidacy, in order, of H5N1=
, H9N2
  and H6N1 viruses. These viruses have been made available for the producti=
on of
  diagnostic reagents and exploratory vaccines. The 1997 incident upheld th=
e
  hypothesis that southern China is an epicentre for the emergence of pande=
mic
  influenza viruses. However, the intensification of the poultry (chicken)
  industry worldwide coupled with the spread of viruses such as the Eurasia=
n
  lineage of H9N2 suggest that the genesis of a pandemic could take place
  elsewhere in the world. This re-emphasizes the importance of systematic v=
irus
  surveillance of poultry globally for international public health and for
  economic and food concerns. Faced with an incipient pandemic in 1997, Hon=
g Kong
  brought in international experts to join the investigative effort. Good
  teamwork at all levels is essential in dealing with the many facets. The =
threat
  of a pandemic should not be minimized, nor should governments be lulled i=
nto a
  sense of false security. The media is a powerful channel and has the
  responsibility and the avenues to convey and influence public perception =
of
  events. Close liaison between the media and those on the operational side
  ensures effective, accurate and timely dissemination of information. This=
 will
  enhance public confidence in the investigative process and in steps taken=
 for
  its safety and health.

AB: The National Tuberculosis Genotyping and Surveillance Network was
  established in 1996 to perform a 5-year, prospective study of the usefuln=
ess of
  genotyping Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates to tuberculosis control
  programmes in the USA. Seven sentinel sites identified all new cases of
  tuberculosis, collected information on patients and contacts, and obtaine=
d
  patient isolates. Seven genotyping laboratories performed DNA fingerprint=
ing
  analysis by the international standard IS6110 method. BioImage Whole Band
  Analyzer software was used to analyse patterns, and distinct patterns wer=
e
  assigned unique designations. Isolates with six or fewer bands on IS6110
  patterns were also spoligotyped. Patient data and genotyping designations=
 were
  entered in a relational database and merged with selected variables from =
the
  national surveillance database. In two related databases, we compiled the
  results of routine contact investigations and the results of investigatio=
ns of
  the relationships of patients who had isolates with matching genotypes. W=

airs
  found during routine tuberculosis (TB) contact investigations in seven se=
ntinel
  sites in the USA (Arkansas, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey=

  California and Texas) from 1996 to 2000. Transmission was confirmed when =
the
  DNA fingerprints of source and secondary cases matched. Of 538 case pairs
  identified, 156 (29%) did not have matching fingerprints. Case pairs from=
 the
  same household were no more likely to have confirmed transmission than th=
ose
  linked elsewhere. Case pairs with unconfirmed transmission were more like=
ly to
  include a smear-negative source case (odds ratio (OR) 2.0) or a foreign-b=
orn
  secondary case (OR 3.4) and less likely to include a secondary case < 15 =
years
  old (OR 0.3). Our study suggests that contact investigations should focus=
 not
  only on the household but also on all settings frequented by an index cas=
e.
  Foreign-born persons with TB may have been infected previously in high
  -prevalence countries; screening and preventive measures recommended by t=

  Institute of Medicine could prevent TB reactivation in these cases.

ed as
  a molecular marker for surveillance of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant Plasmod=
ium
  falciparum malaria but this proposal has not been validated by population=

  surveys. In 1998-99, in 6 Ugandan sentinel sites, the prevalence of P.
  falciparum infections with the T76 genotype and the level of CQ use were
  measured by community surveys, and CQ resistance was determined by in-viv=
o
  tests on 6-59-month-old children with clinical malaria. The prevalence of=
 T76
  was not related to the overall clinical (early and late treatment failure=
:
  ETF+LTF; r=3D0.14, P=3D0.78) or parasitological (RI+RII+RIII; r=3D0.17, P=
=3D0.73) CQ
  resistance. However, the percentage of individuals carrying only infectio=
ns
  with the T76 genotype (T76 alone) increased with increasing ETF (r=3D0.76=
,
  P=3D0.07) and type RIII parasitological failure (r=3D0.69, P=3D0.12). Sim=
ilarly, the
  ratio between T76 and K76 (the wild type) prevalences (T76/K76) was stron=
gly
  and positively correlated with ETF (r=3D0.85, P=3D0.03) and RIII (r=3D0.8=
2, P=3D0.04).
  Moreover, T76 alone (r=3D0.90, P=3D0.01) as well as T76/K76 (r=3D0.90, P=
=3D0.01)
  significantly increased with increasing community CQ use. T76 alone and T=

  season. CDC conducts active national surveillance during each October-May=
 to
  detect the emergence and spread of influenza virus variants and to monito=
r
  influenza-related morbidity and mortality. Surveillance data are provided
  weekly throughout the influenza season to public health officials, WHO, a=
nd
  health-care providers and are used to guide vaccine strain selection,
  prevention and control activities, and patient care. Influenza vaccinatio=
n is
  the most effective means for reducing the yearly effect of influenza.
  Typically, one or two of the influenza vaccine component viruses are upda=
ted
  each year so that vaccine strains will closely match circulating viruses.

AB: Zimbabwe, like most countries in southern Africa, has one of the most
  devastating HIV epidemics seen to date. According to available informatio=
n, HIV
  is thought to have begun to spread rapidly within Zimbabwe in the mid-198=
0s
  with adult HIV prevalence reaching approximately 9% by 1990. The most rec=
ent
  published sentinel surveillance figures for Zimbabwe suggest that the nat=
ional
  level of HIV prevalence among women attending antenatal clinics increased=
 from
  29% in 1997 to 35% in 2000. Even after adjusting for likely selection bia=
s in
  sentinel sites, it was estimated that HIV prevalence amongst adults in Zi=
mbabwe
  had increased from 25% to 30% during the intervening 3-year period. In tr=
ying
  to explain this trend most analysts have focused on behavioural and
  sociological aspects of why HIV has spread so rapidly in southern Africa.=
 These
  include studies on patterns of infection and demographic impact by socio
  -demographic risk group and relative levels of HIV infection among more a=
nd
  less educated people. A comprehensive review of HIV/AIDS in southern Afri=
ca has
  recently been produced covering a broad perspective of the problem, rangi=
ng
  from epidemiology, psychosocial and cultural determinants, government pol=
icies
  and country level experiences.

AB: Background: Data from sentinel serosurveillance are useful to estimate =
HIV
  infection in populations but may not be representative of the general
  population. General population-based surveys attempt to avoid selection b=
ias
  and are the most appropriate for tracking changes in exposure to risk of =
HIV
  infection over time and assessing changes in behaviour following preventi=
on
  campaigns. Objectives: To provide baseline data for targeted sexually
  transmitted infection (STI) and HIV infection prevention interventions by
  studying parameters of sexual behaviour and knowledge of HIV infection an=
d
  STIs, measuring health-seeking behaviour related to STIs, and measuring
  gonorrhoea, Chlamydia, syphilis, and HIV-1 prevalences. Design: Populatio=
n
  -based survey with stratified sampling by age group from randomly selecte=
d
  households in a suburb of Mombasa, Kenya. Methods: A standard questionnai=
re was
  administered to 1497 consenting adults between the ages of 15 and 49 year=
s who
  lived in randomly selected households. Urine and blood samples were obtai=
ned
  for the estimation of gonorrhoea, chlamydial infection, syphilis, and HIV=
-1
  infection prevalences. Results: Sexual activity in the past 12 months was
  limited to one partner in all age groups for most sexually active men (68=
%) and
  women (88%). More men than women reported two or more partners in the pas=
t 12
  months (23% vs. 5%, respectively). Almost one half of those persons in th=
e 15-
  to 19-year-old age group (56% of boys and 48% of girls) were sexually act=
ive.
  Condom use was low with all sexual partners, more so for women than for m=
en.
  Reported STI symptoms in the past 12 months were high for both men and wo=
men.
  Knowledge of STI symptoms and HIV infection was present but incomplete. O=
verall
  HIV seroprevalence was 10.8%, with significantly higher rates among women
  (13.7%) than among men (8.0%). HIV seroprevalence in the 15- to 19-year-o=
ld age
  group was 3.2%. Female gender, Protestant religion, Catholic religion, an=
d
  being divorced, separated, and widowed were significantly associated with=
 HIV
  seroprevalence. Prevalences of gonorrhoea, chlamydial infection, and syph=
ilis
  were 0.9%, 1.5%, and 1.3%, respectively. Conclusions: This study emphasiz=
es the
  vulnerability of young adults, in particular young women, to HIV infectio=
n and
  the need for intensive interventions in this group. The low use of condom=
s,
  incomplete knowledge of HIV infection and STIs, the high number of report=
ed
  STIs, and the relatively low HIV-1 seroprevalence among the 15- to 19-yea=
r-old
  group indicate a large need for intensive STI and HIV infection preventio=
n
  programmes, especially for the 15- to 19-year-old age group.

AB: Background and aim: Several cases of acute colitis induced by non-stero=
idal
  antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been reported but the general role o=
f
  recent NSAID intake as a risk factor for acute diarrhoea has not been stu=
died
  to date. The aim of our study was to determine whether the risk of acute
  diarrhoea is increased by NSAIDs in a prospective series of acute diarrho=
ea
  cases which were seen by general practitioners in France and were serious
  enough to require a faecal culture. Patients, physicians and methods: A t=
otal
  of 285 consecutive patients with acute diarrhoea, seen by Sentinel genera=
l
  practitioners (GPs) between December 1998 and July 1999, were enrolled in=
 a
  case crossover study in which each case served as his/her own control. GP=
s
  collected information on exposure to NSAIDs during the four-month period
  preceding the onset of diarrhoea. The relative risk of NSAID related acut=
e
  diarrhoea was estimated by comparing exposure to NSAIDs during a risk per=
iod
  preceding the onset of diarrhoea with exposure during the first part of t=
he
  four-month observation period. Three risk periods lasting for one, three =
and
  six days before the onset of diarrhoea were considered. Results: The rela=
tive
  risks of acute diarrhoea due to recent NSAID intake were increased for al=
l
  three risk periods. These risks and their confidence intervals were 2.9 (=
1.4
  -6.1) for the one day risk period, 2.7 (1.4-5.1) for the three day period=
, and
  3.3 (2.0-5.4) for the six day period. Conclusion: Recent NSAID intake eme=
rges
  as a risk factor for acute diarrhoea. We suggest that acute diarrhoea see=
n in
  general practice, and not only acute colitis seen by gastroenterologists,
  should be considered as a potential complication of recent NSAID intake.

AB: Objective: The objective of this article is to provide a comprehensive
  overview of the evolution of the Mexican HIV/AIDS surveillance system bet=
ween
  1986 and 2001. Design: All information was collected through an extensive
  literature search. Methods: Databases such as the Mexican National AIDS
  Programmes RIMSIDA (Registry of Mexican AIDS Research), MedLINE, PopLine,=
 and
  AIDSLINE were used. Databases, keywords, and MeSH headings to search were
  discussed and agreed upon before and during the literature search. Result=
s: Two
  hundred and twenty articles and conference abstracts were reviewed and sh=
owed
  that the Mexican surveillance system has undergone many adaptations. The
  HIV/AIDS surveillance system began in 1986, when the focus was on identif=
ying
  AIDS cases. This period was followed by special studies among risk groups=
, and
  served as the basis for the sentinel surveillance system that was adopted=
 in
  1990. The system now requires HIV and AIDS case reporting as well as sent=
inel
  surveillance. Mexico has also carried out the piloting of the behavioural
  surveillance component of Second Generation Surveillance. Conclusion: The
  Mexican experience illustrates how surveillance systems need to be dynami=
c in
  order to monitor trends in HIV over time. This review also demonstrates t=
hat
  middle-income countries can successfully implement surveillance systems.
  However, although Mexico has had many successes, a need exists to address
  issues that limit its ability to implement AIDS case and behavioural
  surveillance fully and consistently.

AB: Western Australia experienced its worst-ever outbreak of the mosquito-b=
orne
  Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) virus during the 2000 wet season. Highes=
t-on
  -record rainfall throughout much of the state during the 2000 wet season =
gave
  rise to extensive mosquito breeding and increased MVE virus transmission,
  resulting in 9 cases of encephalitis. Activity of MVE virus in Western
  Australia is monitored by detecting MVE virus-specific antibodies in seru=
m from
  sentinel fowls, located at towns and communities throughout the north of =
the
  state. However, during 2000, all 28 flocks of fowls seroconverted to MVE =
virus,
  including a flock located > 600 km further south than MVE virus activity =
had
  ever previously been recorded. Furthermore, the majority of the 9 cases o=
f
  encephalitis occurred outside the enzootic Kimberley region. We therefore
  undertook a major serosurvey of domestic fowl flocks both south and east =
of the
  previously defined regions of virus activity. The results suggest that MV=
E
  virus activity extended as far south as the Midwest and northern Goldfiel=
ds
  during 2000. A new southern limit of activity of MVE virus is therefore
  proposed. The results have implications for managing outbreaks of MVE vir=
us in
  Western Australia and have enabled us to locate additional sentinel flock=
s as
  part of the MVE surveillance programme for future years.

AB: A study was conducted to assess the progress towards elimination of neo=
natal
  tetanus (NT), at the district level in India, using the WHO-UNICEF algori=
thm;
  to evaluate the impact of the tetanus toxoid (TT) supplementary immunizat=
ion
  activities (SIAs) between April-May 1988 and April 1999 in Rajasthan, Ind=
ia;
  and to review hospital records and evaluate the case-fatality rate (CFR) =
among
  NT cases. The NT incidence rate in 32 districts of Rajasthan was 0.30, 0.=
19 and
  0.20 per 1000 livebirths in 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively. However, t=
he
  surveillance did not meet the WHO-UNICEF algorithm sensitivity and could =
not be
  accepted as the actual incidence of the disease. In at least 28 of the 32
  districts, more than 80% of pregnant women had received 2 or more doses o=
f TT
  vaccine during routine immunization or SIAs. Only 3 deaths were recorded =
within
  the study period. Women of childbearing age were immunized and 28%, 26% a=
nd 43%
  received their 1st, 2nd and 3rd TT doses. When only rural areas are taken=
 into
  account, overall TT coverage was 43%, 28% and 5% for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd
  doses, respectively. Approximately 1/4 and 1/3 of the immunized women who
  delivered during the study period received their 2nd and 3rd TT dose duri=
ng an
  SIA, respectively. Hospital records of NT cases were reviewed and reveale=
d that
  in 1997, 4 of 16 NT patients died. In 1999, 4 of 23 patients died, 8 reco=
vered,
  and 11 left against medical advice. The survey findings indicate that NT
  incidence in Tonk District has probably reached elimination level and tha=
t 83%
  of pregnant women and 61% of women of childbearing age have received 2 or=
 more
  doses of TT. Hospital data can serve as a valuable source of sentinel
  information to help identify high risk areas and populations.

AB: North Florida is a transition zone between widespread Culex nigripalpus
  populations to the south and focal Culex salinarius populations to the no=
rth.
  Culex nigripalpus is a vector of St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) and eastern
  equine encephalitis (EEE) viruses in south Florida, while C. salinarius i=
s a
  suspected New World vector of West Nile (WN) virus. Abundant vector popul=
ations
  are often a prerequisite for epidemic and epizootic transmission of
  arboviruses. Extensive SLE transmission has never been reported from nort=
h
  Florida, but sporadic WN transmission was reported there during the summe=
r of
  2001. The disparate flavivirus transmission patterns observed in north an=
d
  south Florida may be due, in part, to the local geographical and seasonal
  distribution of Culex vectors. Here we report that between May 1991 and A=
pril
  1994, C. salinarius was most commonly observed during the winter and spri=
ng in
  northeast Florida (Duval County), whereas C. nigripalpus was most abundan=
t
  during the summer and autumn. An unusually mild spring in 1991 allowed C.
  nigripalpus to reproduce early in the year, resulting in a summer populat=
ion
  that emerged more than 8 weeks earlier than in 1992 and 1993. The 1991 C.
  nigripalpus population persisted through October, when SLE transmission w=
as
  detected by sentinel chickens. Transmission of SLE was not detected in Du=
val
  County in 1992 or 1993. These data indicate that mild winter and spring
  conditions in north Florida may favour increased abundance and survival o=
f C.
  nigripalpus in a region where this species is normally not abundant. A se=
asonal
  shift in population structure may increase the transmission risk of arbov=
iruses
  for which C. nigripalpus is a competent vector, including SLE, WN, and EE=
E.

AB: The interaction between soil types, temperature, and soil water potenti=
al
  may have differential effects on the survival of Cryptosporidium parvum o=
ocysts
  in the terrestrial environment. We examined the effects of three soil typ=
es (a
  silty clay loam, silt loam, and loamy sand), three temperatures (4, 20, a=
nd
  30=B0C), and three soil water potentials (-0.033, -0.5 and -1.5 MPa) on t=
he
  inactivation kinetics of oocysts. Sentinel chambers were filled with air-=
dried
  and sieved soil, brought to the appropriate soil water potential, and
  inoculated with 2 x 106 freshly purified oocysts. The inoculated chambers=
 were
  buried in the same bulk soil at the appropriate water potentials and incu=
bated
  at one of the three temperatures. Triplicate chambers were removed from t=
he
  bulk soil on days 0, 22, 43, 84 and 156. Sentinel oocysts were extracted,=
 and
  assayed for potential infectivity by the dye permeability method. Oocysts
  suspended in sterile distilled water and incubated with the sentinel cham=
bers
  were used as controls for the effect of temperature. The soil water poten=
tials
  investigated did not affect oocyst inactivation at any temperature or wit=
h any
  of the three soil types. Rates of oocyst inactivation increased significa=
ntly
  between 4 and 20=B0C, but not between 20 and 30=B0C with the exception of=
 oocysts
  incubated in the silty clay loam. Oocyst survival appeared to be signific=
antly
  greater in the silt loam soil than in the two other soil types when incub=
ated
  at 20=B0C; and at 30=B0C oocyst survival was significantly less in the si=
lt clay
  loam than in the other two soil types. Rates of sentinel oocyst inactivat=
ion at
  all three soil water potentials were significantly lower than the control
  oocysts in water at the three test temperatures. Thus, oocyst survival in=
 soil
  was not affected by the water potentials between -0.033 and -1.5 MPa; it =
was
  affected by soil texture; but temperature appeared to be the factor most
  affecting oocyst survival. In the critical ambient range of temperature i=
n
  temperate climates oocysts may survive for months in agricultural soil, a=
nd
  pose a threat to surface waters.

  600 Bs ITU/mg) on P. columbiae and A. quadrimaculatus at 2 rates of appli=
cation
  in Arkansas (1999), and on A. quadrimaculatus in 2 types of commercial ri=
ce
  fields in Mississippi (1999 and 2000), at various times after treatment. =
In
  1999, an aerial application of VectoLex WDG at 1.68 and 0.56 kg/ha agains=
t
  sentinel 3rd stage larvae of P. columbiae installed in 0.42-ha rice plots=
 48 h
  after treatment provided no control at 72 and 96 h after treatment. In a =
later
  test, VectoLex WDG manually applied at 5.04 and 1.68 kg/ha to small rice =
plots
  containing sentinel 3rd stage larvae of P. columbiae and A. quadrimaculat=
us
  obtained 90 and 97% control of P. columbiae, respectively, 24 h after
  treatment. A 2nd installation of P. columbiae at 24 h after treatment res=
ulted
  in 7 and 0% control, respectively. Poor control was obtained at both rate=
s
  against A. quadrimaculatus 24 and 48 h after treatment for both installat=
ions.
  In the 1999 Cleveland test, VectoLex WDG aerially applied at 1.68 and 0.5=
6
  kg/ha to 0.2-ha plots in a contoured rice field produced 81 and 85% reduc=
tions
  in early larvae and 94 and 76% reductions in late larvae of A. quadrimacu=
latus
  2 days after treatment, respectively. In 2000, VectoLex WDG applied at 1.=
68
  kg/ha to two 0.40-ha plots in a precision-leveled field yielded 59 and 10=
0%
  reductions of early and late larvae, respectively, 2 days after treatment=
.
  Reduction of late larvae remained 100% at 8 days after treatment. It is
  suggested that the differences in susceptibility of P. columbiae and A.
  quadrimaculatus to VectoLex WDG could be attributed to species difference=
s in
  larval feeding behaviour, body positioning in the water column and
  developmental time.

AB: Aims: To (1) describe the South African Community Epidemiology Network =
on
  Drug Use (SACENDU), (2) describe trends and associated consequences of al=
cohol
  and other drug (AOD) use in South Africa for January 1997 to December 199=
9 and
  (3) outline selected policy implications identified by SACENDU participan=
ts.
  Methods: A descriptive epidemiological study of AOD indicators based on d=
ata
  gathered from multiple sources, including specialist treatment centres, t=
rauma
  units and quantitative studies of target groups such as school students a=
nd
  arrestees. Networks were established in five sentinel sites to facilitate=
 the
  collection, interpretation and dissemination of data. Results: Over time
  alcohol has been the most frequently reported primary substance of abuse =
across
  sites. Trauma and psychiatric data highlight the burden associated with a=
lcohol
  abuse. Cannabis and Mandrax (methaqualone), alone or in combination, are =
the
  most frequently reported illicit drugs of abuse, generally comprising the
  largest proportions of drug-related arrests, drug-related psychiatric dia=
gnoses
  and drug-positive trauma patients. From 1997 to 1999, a significant incre=
ase in
  indicators for cocaine/crack and heroin occurred in two sites. Ecstasy (M=
DMA)
  use, alone or in combination with other substances, is reported among you=
ng
  people. Conclusions: A broad range of globally abused substances is prese=
nt in
  South Africa and the use and burden of illicit substances appears to be

AB: From 1995 to 2001, five rounds of sentinel surveillance were carried ou=
t for
  young women attending antenatal care clinics at four health centres in Ad=
dis
  Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia, to monitor trends in the prevalence =
of HIV
  infection and syphilis. Serum samples were tested for antibodies to HIV (=
enzyme
  -linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting) and antibodies to Trepo=
nema
  pallidum (T. pallidum haemagglutination assay and rapid plasma reagin tes=
t).
  Prevalence ratios for an increase in one calendar year were estimated usi=
ng log
  -binomial models. Between 1995 and 2001, the prevalence of HIV infection =
among
  young women (age range, 15-24 years) attending antenatal care clinics in =
inner
  city health centres declined from 24.2% to 15.1% (prevalence ratio for an
  increase in one calendar year, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.87-0.95).=
 No
  change was observed for older age groups or in outer city health centres.=
 The
  decline in the prevalence of active syphilis (T. pallidum haemagglutinati=
on
  assay and rapid plasma reagin testing positive for antibodies to T. palli=
dum)
  was more pronounced among and also restricted to the young age groups (ag=

  range, 15-24 years) in the inner city (from 7.6% in 1995 to 1.3% in 2001;
  prevalence ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.59-0.80). The declinin=
g
  trends in the prevalence of HIV infection and syphilis among young women
  attending antenatal care clinics in the inner city are encouraging, but t=
hese
  findings require confirmation in future years and for other population gr=

  laboratories throughout the UK during 2000. Isolates of the Acinetobacter
  baumannii complex (genomic groups 2, 3 and 13TU; n=3D443) were distinguis=
hed from
  other genomic groups (n=3D152) by PCR fingerprinting of tDNA spacer regio=

,
  imipenem, meropenem, minocycline, piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam,
  rifampicin, sulbactam and tetracycline were determined on IsoSensitest ag=
ar and
  interpreted, wherever possible, using BSAC breakpoints. Tigecycline (GAR-=
936),
  a new glycylcycline, was also tested. Resistance to cephalosporins,
  aminoglycosides and ciprofloxacin was widespread, but carbapenems, colist=
in,
  sulbactam, minocycline and tigecycline were each active against > 80% of =
the
  isolates. Isolates of A. baumannii were more often resistant to cefotaxim=
e,
  ceftazidime, piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, gentam=
icin
  and tetracyclines than those belonging to other genomic groups, but were =
less
  often resistant to colistin; no significant differences between genomic g=
roups
  were noted in the susceptibilities to amikacin, carbapenems, rifampicin o=
r
  sulbactam. The relative activities of the tetracyclines were minocycline =
>
  tigecycline > tetracycline. Thirteen carbapenem-resistant isolates (MICs =
8
  mg/L; 2.2%) were received from six centres; four centres sent single isol=
ates;
  one sent three and one sent six. An allele of bla IMP was detected in one=
 of
  these isolates, but the other 12 isolates either had carbapenemase-indepe=
ndent
  resistance, or undetectable carbapenemase activity combined with other
  resistance mechanisms. In conclusion, carbapenems, colistin and minocycli=
ne
  retained greatest activity against the Acinetobacter isolates collected.
  Tigecycline was less active than minocycline, but both agents overcame mo=

  (ARTI). We sought evidence of HMPV infection in patients who had visited
  general practitioners, had influenzalike illnesses (ILI), and had negativ=

 of
  national virological surveillance, sentinel general practices in England =

2000
  -01. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HMPV, infl=
uenza
  A (H1 and H3), influenza B, and HRSV (A and B) was used to screen combine=
d nose
  and throat swabs. PCR products from the HMPV-positive samples were sequen=
ced to
  confirm identity and construct phylogenetic trees. Of 711 swabs submitted=
, 408
  (57.3%) were negative for influenza and HRSV; HMPV was identified in 9 (2=
.2%)
  patients. HMPV appears to be associated with community-acquired ARTI. The
  extent of illness and possible complications related to this new human vi=

have
  drank bottled water than were those with C. jejuni infection and, in gene=

  were more likely to have eaten pate. Important differences in exposures w=

  identified for these 2 Campylobacter species. Exposures that are a risk f=

  infection for both comparison groups might not be identified or might be
  underestimated by case-case analysis. Similarly, the magnitude or directi=

  population risk cannot be assessed accurately. Nevertheless, our findings

AB: From March to December 2001, an outbreak of yellow fever was observed i=
n
  Cote d'Ivoire. Sentinel surveillance for haemorrhagic fever allowed detec=
tion
  of the first case in the Duekoue health district in the heavily wooded we=
stern
  part of the country. A weekly reporting system was established. For each
  suspected case recorded and reported to the Epidemiological Surveillance
  Department at the National Institute of Public Hygiene, a sample was coll=
ected
  and sent for confirmation at the Pasteur Institute of the Cote d'Ivoire. =
The
  outbreak progressed from West to East reaching Abidjan, the economic capi=
tal of
  the country located in the southeast. The epidemic emergency plan consist=
ed of
  setting up a crisis committee to implement epidemiological, entomological=
 and
  virological surveillance, mass vaccination campaigns in areas around conf=
irmed
  cases, and vector control. A total of 280 cases were reported including 3=
2
  confirmed cases and 6 deaths. Eleven out of 62 districts were affected wi=
th
  most cases occurring in cities with more than 10000 inhabitants. Over 3.7
  million persons were vaccinated for an overall coverage of 92.2% in the a=
reas
  where campaigns were carried out. As a result of this outbreak, surveilla=
nce
  for potentially epidemic diseases has been reinforced and surveillance of=
 viral
  transmission is now being considered. A vaccination program for adults ha=
s also
  been established.

AB: Background: Planning and evaluating vaccination programmes depend on
  reliable systems of monitoring disease incidence in the community. In Ita=
ly,
  vaccine-preventable diseases are subject to statutory notification, but t=
hey
  are often unreported. In January 2000, a paediatric sentinel network was
  launched, with the aim of monitoring in a timely and accurate way the
  geographic and temporal trends of vaccine-preventable diseases. Methods: =
The
  network consists of National Health System primary care paediatricians;
  participation is voluntary. The diseases under surveillance include measl=
es,
  mumps, rubella, pertussis and varicella. Case definitions are based on sp=
ecific
  clinical criteria, and paediatricians report cases on a monthly basis.
  Incidence rates are estimated and compared with those obtained by statuto=
ry
  notifications. The proportion of vaccinated cases was also computed. Resu=
lts:
  An average of 468 paediatricians participated each month of a total of 72=
76
  paediatricians under contract for primary care by the National Health Sys=
tem.
  The population under surveillance consisted of 371670 children younger th=
an 15
  years (of a national total of 8347804 children of the same age). The annu=
al
  national incidence per 100000 children was estimated at 5345 for varicell=
a,
  1972 for mumps, 279 for pertussis, 108 for rubella and 62 for measles, al=
though
  wide variations were observed among geographic areas. The national estima=
tes
  were 3-7 times higher than those obtained through statutory notifications=
. For
  all of the diseases, the ratio between the 2 sources of data was signific=
antly
  higher in southern Italy, compared with the rest of the country. The prop=
ortion
  of vaccinated cases was similar for measles and rubella (21 and 17%) but =
was
  approximately 3 times higher for mumps (59%). Most (74%) of the vaccinate=
d
  mumps cases had received the Rubini vaccine strain. Conclusions: The sent=
inel
  surveillance system is considerably more sensitive than statutory
  notifications, particularly in southern Italy. The high percentage of mum=
ps
  cases vaccinated with the Rubini strain indicates a reduced effectiveness=
 of
  this vaccine. Although further improvements are needed, paediatrician-bas=
ed
  sentinel surveillance is a useful tool for evaluating vaccine-preventable
  disease trends.

AB: We described HIV-1 incidence and the prevalence of genetic subtypes amo=

  cocaine users in Sao Paulo, Brazil. A cross-sectional HIV-1 survey was ca=
rried
  out among 839 current cocaine users attending 7 drug treatment units in t=
he Sao
  Paulo metropolitan area from 1997 to 1998. HIV-1 subtyping was performed =
among
  41 positive individuals using the heteroduplex mobility assay and DNA
  sequencing. Participants were mainly male (95.7%) with a history of previ=
ous
  imprisonment (54%), and the mean age was 26.9 years (SD=3D7.2). The major=
ity
  (64.4%) were current crack cocaine users, and 82.1% of the total particip=
ants
  were noninjectors. HIV-1 seroprevalence was 4.9% (95% confidence interval=
 (CI):
  3.6-6.6), and the incidence (estimated by the sensitive/less-sensitive
  immunoassay testing strategy) was 0.71% per year (95% CI: 0.07-3.03). HIV=
-1
  subtype B was predominant (90.3%), followed by subtype F. There was no
  statistically significant association between HIV-1 subtype and specific =
route
  of drug administration. Our incidence data show evidence of recent HIV-1
  transmission among cocaine users, mainly among noninjectors. Detection of
  recently infected HIV-1 cases linked to genetic diversity analysis may pr=
ovide
  baseline information for public health interventions in this sentinel gro=
up.

AB: Available techniques for monitoring the health situation have proven
  insufficient, thus leading to a discussion of the need for their improvem=
ent
  based on new data collection strategies allowing for data use by local he=
alth
  systems. This article presents the methodological basis for a strategy to
  monitor health problems utilizing demarcated intra-urban spaces called
  "sentinel areas" to collect fundamental social, economic, behavioural, an=
d
  biological data for public health that allow for a closer approach to the
  reality of complex social spaces. The authors present an experience that =
is
  being developed in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, to evaluate the epidemiologic=
al
  impact of an environmental sanitation program. They discuss selection cri=
teria
  for the areas and the potential uses of this strategy allowing for the ra=
pid
  utilization of epidemiological resources by health services and the timel=
y
  application of the results to reorient and enhance health intervention
  practices.

 the
  basis of a low-cost, simple-to-repeat set of household surveys in all nin=

  administrative departments using sentinel community sites. This system al=
lows
  each department to independently conduct follow-up surveys as needed. The
  results of the first round of surveys conducted in 1995 showed lower
  malnutrition rates in typical food-deficient departments and high levels =
of
  malnutrition in several food-surplus areas. Further analyses underscore t=
he
  importance of variables related to child care practices and of care-enabl=
ing
  factors such as household food security, health environment, and caregive=

  (EIA) method for the direct, rapid, qualitative, simultaneous, and differ=
ential
  detection of the influenza A (IA) and B (IB) virus antigen in different
  respiratory samples. The EIA method was compared with the shell vial cult=
ure
  system (MDCK cell line) used with the same samples. We studied 160 sample=
s from
  93 (58.1%) paediatric patients (hospital emergency room) and from 67 (41.=
9%)
  adult patients (sentinel network). Seventy-four (46.2%) samples were cons=
idered
  positive; of them, 46 (62.2%) were from paediatric patients and 28 (37.8%=
) were
  from an adult group (P < 0.05), with overall positive values of 49.9% and
  41.7%, respectively. All 74 (100%) of the positive samples were isolated =
in
  cell culture versus the 68.9% that were detected as positive by the new E=
IA
  method (P < 0.05). Of the 41 samples positive for the IA virus, the EIA
  detected 34 (82.9%) positive samples; of the 33 samples positive for the =
IB
  virus, the EIA detected 17 (51.5%) positive samples (P < 0.05). No false
  -positive reaction was detected with the EIA method (specificity and posi=
tive
  predictive value of 100%). The overall results obtained in the comparison
  between the new EIA and the shell vial culture had a sensibility of 82.9%=
 and
  predictive negative values of 92.4% for the IA virus and 51.5% and 84.3%,
  respectively, for the IB virus. This evaluation shows sensitivity and
  specificity percentages for the new EIA method that is acceptable for rou=
tine
  use in IA virus detection. The results obtained were worse for IB virus
  detection, but this new EIA method is actually the only one with the capa=
city
  to differentiate between the two influenza viruses.

AB: Sentinel practice networks have been established in many European count=
ries
  to monitor disease incidence in the community. To demonstrate the value o=
f
  sentinel networks, an international study on the incidence of chicken pox=
 has
  been undertaken. Chicken pox was chosen as an acute condition for which
  incidence data are important to the determination of health policy on vac=
cine
  use. The project examined the incidence of chicken pox reported in sentin=
el
  networks in England and Wales (UK), Netherlands, Portugal and Spain (two
  regional networks) in January-June 2000, and the potential underestimate =
from
  patients who did not consult. An investigation of secondary household con=
tact
  cases was undertaken. Reported incidence of chicken pox (all ages) in Eng=
land
  and Wales was 25 per 10000, in Netherlands 13 per 10000, in Portugal 21 p=
er
  10000, in Spain Castilla y Leon 27 per 10000 and in Spain Basque 55 per 1=
0000.
  Analysis of secondary contact cases suggested underestimation of incidenc=
e
  between 2.4% in Spain Castilla y Leon and 32.2% in Netherlands. There was=
 a
  trend towards incidence at an earlier age in England and Wales, and in
  Netherlands compared with Portugal and Spain. Whilst there was little pro=
blem
  in reliably identifying the number of incident cases in the recording net=
works
  and relating the non-consulting contact cases to them, the security of th=
e
  denominator remains a problem where networks are comprised of differing
  categories of health care provider. It is essential that numerator and

AB: Background: In recent surveillance data there are still many cases of
  measles and even local epidemics in Germany. We studied whether delayed m=
easles
  vaccination contributes to this situation. Methods: Vaccine coverage data=
 in
  children < 3 years of age were assessed in summer 1999 by a telephone sur=
vey.
  Three data sources for measles surveillance were analysed: official measl=
es
  notifications; sentinel data; and official hospital discharge diagnoses.
  Results: After the time recommended for completion of measles vaccination=
 at
  month 15, only 22% of German children had received their first vaccine do=
se.
  This percentage increased to 77% at the age of 24 months and to 87% at 36
  months of age. According to all three surveillance instruments, the numbe=
r of
  measles cases was highest in children age 1 to 4 years with a peak in the
  second year of life. Conclusions: More than 50% of measles cases in one-y=
ear
  -old children would be prevented if presently observed vaccine coverage r=
ates
  in the third year of life could be achieved 12 months earlier. Delayed me=
asles
  vaccination is responsible for a large number of measles cases still occu=
rring
  in the German population, where measles has not yet been eliminated. If
  vaccination were delivered according to the recommended time schedule, th=
e
  incidence of measles would be considerably reduced.

AB: The distribution of the sylvatic subtype ID Venezuelan equine encephali=
tis
  (VEE) viruses in the lowland tropical forests of western Venezuela was
  investigated using remote sensing and geographic information system
  technologies. Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper satellite imagery was used to stu=
dy the
  reflectance patterns of VEE endemic foci and to identify other locations =
with
  similar reflectance patterns. Enzootic VEE virus variants isolated during=
 this
  study are the closest genetic relatives of the epizootic viruses that eme=
rged
  in western Venezuela during 1992-1993. VEE virus surveillance was conduct=
ed by
  exposing sentinel hamsters to mosquito bites and trapping wild vertebrate=
s in
  seven forests identified and located by means of the satellite image. We
  isolated VEE viruses from 48 of a total of 1363 sentinel hamsters in two =
of the
  forests on six occasions, in both dry and wet seasons. None of the 12 sma=
ll
  vertebrates captured in 8190 trap-nights showed signs of previous VEE vir=
us
  infection. The satellite image was classified into 13 validated classes o=
f land
  use/vegetation using unsupervised and supervised techniques. Data derived=
 from
  the image consisted of the raw digital values of near- and mid-infrared b=
ands
  4, 5 and 7, derived Tasseled Cap indices of wetness, greenness and bright=
ness,
  and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. Digitized maps provided
  ancillary data of elevation and soil geomorphology. Image enhancement was
  applied using Principal Component Analysis. A digital layer of roads toge=
ther
  with georeferenced images was used to locate the study sites. A cluster
  analysis using the above data revealed two main groups of dense forests
  separated by spectral properties, altitude and soil geomorphology. Virus =
was
  isolated more frequently from the forest type identified on flat flood pl=
ains
  of main rivers rather than the forest type found on the rolling hills of =
the
  study area. The spatial analysis suggests that mosquitoes carrying the en=
zootic
  viruses would reach 82-97% of the total land area by flying only 1-3 km f=
rom
  forests. We hypothesize that humans within that area are at risk of sever=
e
  disease caused by enzootic ID VEE viruses. By contrast, equines could act=
ually
  become naturally vaccinated, thus preventing the local emergence of epizo=
otic
  IC VEE virus strains and protecting humans indirectly.

AB: The introduction of a St Louis encephalitis virus (SLE) genotype new to
  southeastern California, USA, during 2000 was followed by focal enzootic
  amplification in the Coachella Valley that was detected by seroconversion=
s of
  29 sentinel chickens in 5 of 9 flocks of 10 chickens each, isolations of =
virus
  from 30 of 538 pools of 50 Culex tarsalis females, and collection of 30
  positive sera from 2205 wild birds. This SLE strain over wintered success=
fully
  and then amplified during the summer of 2001, with 47 sentinel seroconver=
sions
  in 8 of 9 flocks, 70 virus isolations from 719 pools of C. tarsalis and C=
.
  pipiens quinquefasciatus [C. quinquefasciatus] and 40 positive sera from =
847
  wild birds. Human illness was not detected by passive case surveillance,
  despite issuance of a health alert during 2001. Virus amplification durin=
g both
  years was associated with above average temperatures conducive for extrin=
sic
  incubation and below average precipitation during spring associated with =
below
  average vector abundance. Seroconversions by sentinel chickens provided t=
he
  timely detection of virus activity, with initial conversions detected bef=
ore
  positive mosquito pools or wild bird infections. Vertical infection was n=
ot
  detected among C. tarsalis adults reared from immatures collected during =
the
  fall-winter of 2000, even though SLE over wintered successfully in this a=
rea.
  Early seroconversions by a sentinel chicken during February 2001 and a
  recaptured Gambel's quail [Callipepla gambelii] in April 2001 provided ev=
idence
  for transmission during winter and spring when ambient temperatures avera=

AB: In 2000, the OzFoodNet network was established to enhance surveillance =
of
  foodborne diseases across Australia. OzFoodNet consists of 7 sites and co=
vers
  68 per cent of Australia's population. During 2001, sites reported 15815 =
cases
  of campylobacteriosis, 6607 cases of salmonellosis, 326 cases of shigello=
sis,
  71 cases of yersiniosis, 61 cases of listeriosis, 47 cases of shiga-toxin
  producing E. coli and 5 cases of haemolytic uraemic syndrome. Sites repor=
ted 86
  foodborne outbreaks affecting 1768 people, of whom 4.0 per cent (70/1768)=
 were
  hospitalized and one person died. There was a wide range of foods implica=
ted in
  these outbreaks and the most common agent was S. typhimurium. Sites repor=
ted
  two international outbreaks; one of multi-drug resistant S. typhimurium
  Definitive Type 104 due to helva imported from Turkey, and one of S. stan=
ley
  associated with dried groundnuts from China. The National Centre for
  Epidemiology and Population Health conducted a national survey of
  gastroenteritis. Preliminary data from interviews of 2417 people suggests=
 that
  the incidence of foodborne illness is significantly higher than previousl=
y
  thought. OzFoodNet initiated case control studies into risk factors for
  Campylobacter, Salmonella, Listeria, and shiga-toxin producing E. coli.
  OzFoodNet developed a foodborne disease outbreak register for Australia;
  established a network of laboratories to type Campylobacter; prepared a s=
urvey
  of pathology laboratories; reviewed Australian data on listeriosis; and
  assessed the usefulness of sentinel surveillance for gastroenteritis. Thi=
s
  programme of enhanced surveillance has demonstrated its capacity to natio=
nally
  investigate and determine the causes of foodborne disease.

AB: Although vaccination campaigns have significantly reduced the number of
  measles cases worldwide, endemic transmission of measles virus (MV) conti=
nues
  to occur in several continents, including Europe. To obtain current infor=
mation
  on measles incidence and molecular data on circulating MVs in Germany, a
  nationwide measles sentinel was established. Phylogenetic analysis based =
on the
  variable part of the N gene from 80 MVs isolated between November 1999 an=
d
  October 2001 in Germany revealed the presence of at least 6 distinct MV
  genotypes: B3, C2, D4, D6, G2, and a new variant of D7. Both the incidenc=
e and
  the pattern of MV genotypes differed markedly between the former East and=
 West
  Germany. In the eastern part, few measles cases, mainly caused by genotyp=
es
  originating from other countries (B3, D4, G2), were detected. In the west=
ern
  and southern parts, genotypes C2, D6, and D7 were associated with endemic
  transmission. The indigenous genotypes (C2 and D6) predominant during the=
 1990s
  disappeared simultaneously over the period of observation coinciding with=
 the
  emergence and the wide spread of D7 viruses. While the incidence of measl=
es
  remained constant, all MVs isolated in 2001 were assigned to D7. It is no=
ted
  that the haemagglutinin (H) sequence of D7 viruses shows distinct exchang=
es of
  certain amino acids in the stem and propeller domain compared to C2, D6, =
and
  the MV vaccine strains used. This raises the possibility of a selective
  advantage of D7 viruses transmitted in the presence of H-specific antibod=
ies.

  loss, in a higher proportion than the routine mycobacterial staining meth=

  biopsy blocks were retrieved and processed for the immunohistochemical st=
udy,
  by means of anti-BCG polyclonal antibodies for the detection of mycobacte=

  cases, while the immunostaining method confirmed it in 47%. The McNemar t=
est
  showed that the observed difference between these two techniques was
  statistically significant (p=3D < 0.05). In the same way, 50 blocks of sk=
in
  conditions considered in the differential histopathological diagnosis of =
early
  leprosy were processed for the immunohistochemical test to analyse the
  possibility of false-positive results which occurred in 8 (16%) patients.=
 The
  study suggests that immunostaining may increase the proportion of the rou=

  histological diagnosis of leprosy in patients who have sensory loss only,=
 even
  while using biopsies obtained in fieldwork conditions. This is very
  advantageous in hyper-endemic areas and in areas that are in the post

AB: Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether HIV-1
  prevalence among antenatal clinic (ANC) attendees in Cambodia provided a
  reasonable estimate of HIV-1 prevalence among all women 15-49 years. Meth=
ods:
  Antenatal clinic attendees in five HIV sentinel surveillance sites (five
  provinces) were selected by consecutive sampling (n=3D1695). The populati=
on
  survey of females by household was carried out in the same 5 areas. House=
hold
  females aged 15-49 years were selected using a three-stage cluster sampli=
ng
  design (n=3D3066). Serum-based HIV ELISA testing was done for both ANC at=
tendees
  and household females. The HIV prevalence for ANC attendees and household
  females were compared by age group and urban versus rural location. Resul=
ts:
  The overall prevalence of HIV-1 infection among ANC attendees (1.62%, 95%=
 CI:
  1.26-1.98) was similar to the overall prevalence obtained from the genera=
l
  population of household females (1.24%, 95% CI: 0.92-1.55) in the same
  catchment areas in Cambodia. In the rural areas, the overall HIV prevalen=
ce
  among ANC attendees (2.18%, 95% CI: 1.59-2.77) was significantly higher t=
han
  among the household females (0.86%, 95% CI: 0.49-1.23) after adjustment f=
or age
  distribution and education level. In the 15-24 age group in rural areas, =
the
  HIV prevalence of ANC women was 2.71% (95% CI: 0.96-4.46) compared with 0=
.77%
  (95% CI: 0.02-1.53) in household females. Conclusions: Although ANC data =
can be
  used to estimate trends over time, it should be realized that ANC data ma=
y
  overestimate the actual prevalence in the younger age group in rural area=
s in
  Cambodia.

AB: Although considerable information has accumulated in the last decade
  regarding rates of both vaginal colonization and vulvovaginal candidosis =

  in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive women, gaps in our knowled=
ge
  remain, particularly with regard to pathophysiology of clinical disease.
  Unfortunately, early and possibly premature conclusions were reached in t=
he
  late 1980s which resulted in the widespread dissemination of information
  indicating that recurrent VVC (RVVC) was a manifestation of HIV infection=
 and
  that women with RVVC should be tested for HIV. Unfortunately, subsequent =
data
  from cohort studies involving HIV-positive women failed to determine atta=
ck
  rates of symptomatic Candida vaginitis requiring therapy. Recent studies
  indicate that Candida vaginitis, even if more frequent in HIV infected wo=
men,
  is clinically similar to that experienced in HIV-negative women and does =
not
  appear to be of increased clinical severity. VVC in HIV-positive women ca=
n be
  treated by conventional methods including the use of maintenance suppress=
ive
  antifungal therapy and most importantly RVVC in women is not in itself a
  sentinel of HIV infection. Ongoing concerns include vaginal acquisition o=
f non

  C. albicans vaginal isolates.

AB: Background: The objective of this descriptive study is to investigate t=
he
  incidence of type 2 diabetes in sentinel general practices in three regio=
ns in
  Belgium and to describe the patient characteristics and the start of the
  medical management after diagnosis. Methods: For two successive years (19=
97-98)
  all patients who were newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes were registere=
d. Two
  weeks after inclusion, the registering physician completed an extensive
  questionnaire. This questionnaire dealt with risk factors, biochemical
  parameters, existing complications and treatment. Results: According to t=
his
  study, the yearly incidence of type 2 diabetes in Belgium was 231 per 100=
000
  inhabitants. Though the biochemical parameters (BMI, HbA1c, serum cholest=
erol
  and triglycerides) did not differ in the three regions of the country bei=
ng
  investigated, there were considerable differences in the treatment prescr=
ibed
  for diabetes and its co-morbidity. In Flanders, treatment was usually sta=
rted
  with sulfonylurea, in the Walloon provinces with biguanides. Hypolipaemic
  treatment was also started more frequently in the latter region. In Fland=
ers,
  hypertension was registered in 51.4% of the newly diagnosed patients with
  diabetes, which was higher than in the other regions. However, no differe=
nce
  was noted between the different regions in the number of patients with di=
abetes
  who are treated for hypertension. Conclusion: A network of sentinel physi=
cians,
  taking part in voluntary registration, can be helpful in calculating the
  incidence of a health problem, in particular type 2 diabetes in general
  practice. The sentinel net can also serve as an instrument for describing
  patient characteristics and showing how physicians deal with health probl=
ems.
  The regional differences in medical approach that are described require f=
urther
  investigation, mainly with respect to their impact on the patients' outco=
me.

AB: This study aimed to use a standard questionnaire to obtain a nationally
  representative sample of opinions on a range of potential food risks.
  Participants were a national sample of 1182 subjects selected using three
  different approaches: random and sentinel postal samples and a telephone
  survey. The sites selected were Glasgow and Inverness in Scotland, Nottin=
gham
  and Lincoln in England, Cardiff and Llandudno in Wales and postal area SE=
19 in
  London. A modified psychometric questionnaire (the Perceived Food Risk In=
dex)
  was administered to subjects on three occasions, spanning five time-point=
s.
  Baseline data collection was undertaken from October to December 1998 (ph=
ase
  1). The second wave of data collection was undertaken over three time-poi=
nts in
  February, April and July 1999 (one-third of respondents to phase 1 at eac=
h time
  -point -- data combined as phase 2), and the final phase of data collecti=
on was
  between October and December 1999 (phase 3). Principal components analysi=
s was
  used to assess the intercorrelations between the items on the questionnai=
re.
  Two main components were identified as 'dread' and 'knowledge'. Saturated=
 fats
  were perceived as the least dreaded and the most known of the potential r=
isks
  considered, while bovine spongiform encephalopathy and Salmonella were th=
e
  risks dreaded the most. There was a slight perception that the potential =
risks
  had become more known over the year, especially for growth hormones. This=
 study
  has raised a number of important issues for risk communicators. Despite c=
urrent
  policy aimed at reducing fat intake, this will be difficult to achieve at=
 a
  population level since people are not worried about its impact, yet food =
safety
  continues to be a significant concern to the public.

 PVP
  from 31 to 50% by month (P < 0.001). Specificity was calculated as 93% in
  November. The sensitivity of ISSS was found to be sufficient regardless o=
f the
  magnitude of influenza activity. Specificity varied by season, indicating=
 the
  difficulty of clinically diagnosing other respiratory illnesses. The PVP
  remained at less than 50% before and after the influenza seasons and it v=
aried

AB: Objectives: To estimate HIV incidence, characterize correlates of HIV
  seroconversion, and monitor temporal trends in HIV transmission among pat=
ients
  repeatedly tested for HIV by a county hospital in San Francisco. Design:
  Retrospective longitudinal study. Methods: HIV incidence was retrospectiv=
ely
  calculated among persons voluntarily tested for HIV antibody more than on=
ce at
  San Francisco's county hospital or one of its affiliated satellite commun=
ity
  clinics between 1993 and 1999. Linkage of HIV test results in computerize=
d
  databases identified "seroconverters" as individuals who had a negative
  antibody test followed by a positive test. The interval between tests was=
 used
  as the person-time at risk. Cox proportional hazards analysis identified
  correlates of HIV seroconversion. Results: A total of 84 HIV seroconversi=
ons
  were identified among 2893 eligible patients repeatedly tested for HIV an=
tibody
  over a cumulative 5860 person-years (PYs) (incidence of 1.4 per 100 PYs, =
95%
  confidence interval (CI): 1.2-1.7). The majority of seroconversions (71
  (84.5%)) were among injection drug users (IDUs) (incidence of 2.0 per 100=
 PYs,
  CI: 1.6-2.4). HIV incidence was highest among men who have sex with men (=
MSM)
  who were also IDUs (incidence of 3.8 per 100 PYs, CI: 2.7-5.1) and lowest=
 among
  non-IDUs, heterosexual men, and non-IDU women (incidence of 0.3 per 100 P=
Ys,
  CI: 0.1-0.6). In multivariate analysis, correlates of HIV seroconversion =
were
  age 25 to 29 years (hazard ratio (HR)=3D3.9, CI: 2.4-6.3), MSM (HR=3D2.9,=
 CI: 1.9
  -4.4), and IDU (HR=3D3.2, CI: 1.8-5.8). Overall, no temporal trend in ann=
ual HIV
  incidence was noted during the study period; however, HIV incidence among=
 MSM
  IDUs increased from 2.9 per 100 PYs in 1996 to 4.7 per 100 PYs in 1998.
  Conclusions: The rate of seroconversion in this hospital and affiliated c=
linic
  population is unexpectedly high. Moreover, HIV transmission among IDU pat=
ients
  has not decreased over the last several years. The San Francisco county
  hospital provides a high-risk sentinel population to monitor emerging tre=
nds in
  HIV transmission, especially among IDUs, and presents multiple opportunit=
ies
  for prevention interventions, because these patients are being seen repea=
tedly
  by clinicians.

 those
  reported in 1999 (84743) and the largest reporting year since the NNDSS
  commenced in 1991. Notifications in 2000 consisted of 28341 bloodborne

  (legionellosis, meningococcal infection, leprosy and tuberculosis) (2%), =
969
  zoonotic infections (1%) and only one case of a quarantinable infection. =
Steep
  declines in some childhood vaccine preventable diseases such as Haemophil=

  notifications of pertussis and legionellosis increased sharply in the yea=
r.
  Notifications of bloodborne viral diseases (particularly hepatitis B and
  hepatitis C) and some sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia,
  continue to increase in Australia. This report also summarizes data on
  communicable diseases from other surveillance systems including the Labor=
atory
  Virology and Serology Surveillance Scheme (LabVISE) and sentinel general
  practitioner schemes. In addition this report comments on other important
  developments in communicable disease control in Australia in 2000.

  illness, laboratory isolations of influenza virus and absenteeism rates f=
rom a
  national employer. In 2001, laboratory-confirmed influenza became a notif=

  disease and was reported to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance
  System (NNDSS). Influenza A was the dominant type, 81% of which were subt=
ype
  H1N1 and 19% were subtype H3N2. The influenza A (H1N1) analysed were all =
A/New
  Caledonia/20/99-like strains. The H3N2 isolates were antigenically simila=
r to
  the reference strain A/Moscow/10/99 and the vaccine strain A/Panama/2007/=
99.
  The influenza B isolates, which made up only 10% of all isolates, were ma=
inly
  B/Sichuan/379/99-like strains but 10 per cent of isolates were more close=
ly
  related to B/Harbin/7/94-like viruses, which circulated in previous years=
. The
  Australian 2001 influenza vaccine represented a good match for the circul=

 to
  sheep in different areas of the Department of Florida, Uruguay, by treati=
ng
  dogs with praziquantel at intervals of 6, 12 and 16 weeks. The 6-week int=
erval
  was based on the prepatent period of infection with E. granulosus, the 12=
- and
  16-week intervals were based on the rate of reinfection with tapeworms in=
 dogs
  in the area. Dogs had become reinfected with E. granulosus between 2 and =
4
  months after treatment, whereas they became reinfected with the Taenia sp=
p.
  tapeworms within 2 months of treatment. One year after the start of treat=
ments,
  sentinel lambs were born and grazed the farms in the three treatment area=
s.
  Approximately 15 months later when the sentinel lambs were killed and exa=
mined
  for parasites, the six weekly treatments had stopped the transmission of =
E.
  granulosus to the sentinel lambs. Treatment of dogs at 12- and 16-week
  intervals failed to stop transmission of E. granulosus, but both the numb=
ers of
  farms and the numbers of sheep infected with E. granulosus were lower whe=
re
  dogs received 12 weekly treatments compared with dogs receiving 16 weekly
  treatments and a fourth area where dogs had received no treatments
  (chi2P=3D0.002). Lambs continued to become infected with the Taenia spp.
  tapeworms in all the areas. Control was complicated by large changes in t=
he dog
  population. From a starting population of 1164 dogs in the three treated =
areas,
  832 new dogs, most of these adult hunting dogs, entered the population an=
d 793
  dogs were lost from the population.

AB: The overall objective of this study is to promote the development of
  environmental health indicators in Mexico City, Mexico. Specific examples
  focused on water quality, household characteristics e.g., sanitation and =
risk
  of enteric diseases. A geographic information system (GIS) was used in or=
der to
  identify eligible wells and their surrounding homesteads (0.5 km around e=
ach
  well). A pilot study was conducted during the rainy season (1999), and a =
total
  of 1250 eligible households were visited on a random sample basis; only t=
hose
  having children under 5 years of age were interviewed. Data on diarrhoeal
  disease (i.e. occurrence in the previous two weeks) were obtained from 95=
0
  children, and their guardians provided information on their water supply,
  sanitation and socioeconomic variables. A total of 320 water samples were
  obtained from 40 wells, and tested for total coliforms (TC/100 ml), faeca=
l
  coliforms (FC/100 ml). Escherichia coli (EC) and faecal streptococci (FS)=
.
  Bacterial indicators were detected in 40% of the wells in the western zon=
e and
  in 32% of the southern zone (P=3D0.01). The rate of diarrhoeal diseases w=
as
  higher for children from the southern areas than in the west (OR=3D1.7 an=
d 95%
  CI: 0.99, 2.86). The final analysis showed a higher risk of diarrhoea in
  children from rented homes than those living in owned dwellings (OR=3D1.7=
 and 95%
  CI: 1.04, 2.77): the risk was also highest for children living in houses =
with
  poor sanitation facilities (e.g., latrine) than those connected to a sewe=
rage
  (OR=3D1.7 and 95% CI: 1.00, 2.93). Children from households perceiving un=
pleasant
  taste of water showed a higher risk than those without complaints (OR=3D2=
.2 and
  95% CI: 1.28, 3.75). Linkages between environmental factors and health ri=
sk
  were created from spatially distributed information, and the proposed
  environmental health indicator (EHI) summarized the most significant pred=
ictors
  of diarrhoeal diseases. This baseline information may contribute to furth=
er
  environmental health investigation and policy making analysis.

AB: An objective of the Workers' Health Program at the Pan American Health
  Organization (PAHO) is to strengthen surveillance in workers' health in t=
he
  Region of the Americas in order to implement prevention and control strat=
egies.
  To date, 4 phases of projects have been organized to develop multinationa=
l
  workplace health and hazard surveillance in the Region. Phase 1 was a wor=
kshop
  held in 1999 in Washington, D.C., USA, for the purpose of developing a
  methodology for identifying and prioritizing the top 3 occupational senti=
nel
  health events to be incorporated into the surveillance systems in the Reg=
ion.
  Three surveillance protocols were developed, one each for fatal occupatio=
nal
  injuries, pesticide poisoning, and low back pain, which were identified i=
n the
  workshop as the most important occupational health problems. Phase 2 comp=
rised
  projects to disseminate the findings and recommendations of the Washingto=
n
  Workshop, including publications, pilot projects, software development,
  electronic communication, and meetings. Phase 3 was a sub-regional meetin=
g in
  2000 in Rosario, Argentina, to follow up on the progress in carrying out =
the
  recommendations of the Washington workshop and to create a Virtual Region=
al
  Centre for Latin America that could coordinate the efforts of member coun=
tries.
  Currently phase 4 includes a number of projects to achieve the objectives=
 of
  this Centre, such as pilot projects, capacity building, editing a compact=
 disk,
  analysing legal systems and intervention strategies, software training, a=
nd
  developing an internet course on surveillance. By documenting the joint e=
fforts
  made to initiate and develop Regional multinational surveillance of
  occupational injuries and diseases in the Americas, this paper aims to pr=
ovide
  experience and guidance for others wishing to initiate and develop region=
al
  multinational surveillance for other diseases or in other regions.

  methods for laboratory rearing for P. fumator, a potential biological con=

  agent of house flies and stable flies in Manitoba, Canada. Of 50842 live
  sentinel house fly pupae retrieved at two Manitoba dairies in 1996, P. fu=
mator
  parasitized 1998 pupae. A total of 4691 naturally occurring house fly and
  stable fly pupae were collected, of which 9.4% were parasitized by P. fum=
ator.
  P. fumator attacked only pupae in the field. When individual females were
  exposed to pupae and 3rd instar house fly larvae in the laboratory, 52.2 =
and
  5.8% of observations were taken when females were in contact with contain=
ers of
  the pupae and larvae, respectively. At 22=B0C, males of P. fumator had
  significantly shorter development times (24.8=B10.1 days, 14 to 35 days; =
n=3D615)
  than females (26.5=B10.2 days, 18 to 35 days; n=3D147). Some P. fumator d=
id not
  emerge immediately and entered a state of larval diapause. A greater prop=
ortion
  of P. fumator in sentinel pupae entered larval diapause (75.8%) than thos=
e in
  naturally occurring pupae (29.5%). P. fumator has considerable potential =
as a
  biological control agent of house flies and stable flies, but factors
  influencing diapause induction and laboratory rearing must be determined.

AB: Objectives: First, to compare the prevalence of HIV infection among wom=
en in
  the general population and antenatal clinic (ANC) attenders in rural Mwan=
za,
  Tanzania, and second, to validate a method for adjusting HIV prevalence i=
n ANC
  attenders to estimate the prevalence in the general female population age=
d 15
  -44 years. Methods: A cross-sectional population survey was conducted in =
12
  rural communities of Mwanza Region, Tanzania between 1991 and 1992. From =
the
  same communities sequential ANC attenders were recruited on two occasions
  between 1991 and 1993. Consenting subjects were interviewed, examined, tr=
eated
  and a serum sample was tested for HIV. The HIV prevalence in women in the
  general population was compared with unadjusted and adjusted prevalences =
in ANC
  attenders. Parity-adjusted prevalences were obtained by applying correcti=
on
  factors to the observed prevalences in parous and nulliparous ANC attende=
rs.
  Results: A total of 5675 women aged 15-44 years from the general populati=
on and
  2265 ANC attenders had complete socio-demographic and laboratory data.
  Unadjusted HIV prevalence was significantly lower in ANC attenders (3.6%)=
 than
  women from the general population (4.7%, P=3D0.025), but after adjustment=
 there
  was no significant difference between the two groups (4.6 versus 4.7%, P=
=3D0.95).
  Conclusion: In this rural population, the HIV prevalence in ANC attenders
  underestimated the prevalence among women in the general population, but =
this
  difference was eliminated by applying parity-based correction factors.
  Information on parity should be routinely collected in ANC-based HIV sent=
inel
  surveillance.

  travellers. Thorough recording of epidemiological and clinical aspects of
  imported malaria has been helpful in the detection of new outbreaks and a=
reas
  of developing drug resistance. Sentinel surveillance of data collected
  prospectively since 1999 has begun within TropNetEurop, a European networ=
k
  focusing on imported infectious diseases. TropNetEurop appears to cover _=
10% of
  all patients with malaria seen in Europe. Reports of 1659 immigrants and
  European patients with Plasmodium falciparum malaria were analysed for
  epidemiological information and data on clinical features. Regional data =
were
  quite diverse, reflecting local patterns of immigration and international
  travel. By far, the most infections were imported from West Africa. Europ=
eans
  had more clinical complications; consequently, all deaths occurred in thi=
s
  group. Compared with European standards, the mortality rate was low (0.6%=
 in
  Europeans). Data from TropNetEurop member sites can contribute to our
  understanding of the epidemiological and clinical findings regarding impo=
rted
  falciparum malaria.

AB: A district based sentinel practice surveillance system for influenza th=
at
  was critical to the identification of a local epidemic affecting the City=
 of
  Liverpool and other areas in the North West of England, UK in the winter =
of
  1998-99 is presented. Weekly overall general practitioner (GP) consultati=
on
  rates showed a rise in the North West early in November 1998. This was
  particularly evident in the 0-4 year age group and corresponded to the an=
nual
  increase in isolates due to respiratory syncytial virus. A steep rise in
  consultation rates then followed commencing first with the 0-4 year age g=
roup
  before affecting successive older birth cohorts. This was subsequently fo=
llowed
  by an increase in isolates of influenza A. The peak age groups for
  consultations for infuenza and 'influenza-like illness' was seen among 0-=
4 year
  olds (790 per 100000 in week 52), followed by the 65+ age group (524 per =
100000
  in week 1), and the 45-64 year olds (516 per 100000 in week 52). The over=
all
  local consultation rate peaked over the Christmas week at 376 per 100000.=
 A
  similar pattern was evident from weekly respiratory deaths. National
  surveillance data showed the peak GP consultation rate was in week 1 at 2=
70.8
  per 100000 population. This was subsequently followed by an increase in
  isolates for influenza A as was also found for local data. The pattern an=
d
  sequence of GP consultation rates demonstrated locally are entirely consi=
stent
  with a regional seasonal increase of influenza.

  essential to track the onset and progress of epidemics. In 1999, the Infl=
uenza
  Pandemic Planning Committee of the Communicable Diseases Network Australi=
a New
  Zealand (CDNANZ) recommended that a national surveillance system be estab=
lished
  comprising both community-based and institutional surveillance. In 2001,
  however, influenza surveillance remains fragmented in Australia and mainl=
y
  restricted to major cities. Methods of surveillance and reporting of infl=
uenza
  activity vary between States and even within States. Three disparate case
  definitions are in use for reporting influenza-like illnesses. Many senti=
nel
  sites do not have laboratory support for confirmation of influenza or
  identification of circulating strains. Dissemination of information is
  uncoordinated and without a standardised reporting format for collation a=
t a
  national level. Prompt attention to these issues is important to ensure a=
n
  adequate public health response to future influenza virus epidemics or a
  pandemic.

AB: In the former West Germany, in specific venereal diseases legislation p=
assed
  in 1953, only syphilis, gonorrhoea, ulcus molle, and lymphogranuloma vene=
reum
  were defined as venereal diseases and subject to mandatory notification. =
The
  proportion of unreported cases was as high as 75% for syphilis and up to =
90%
  for gonorrhoea. Epidemiological data for the past 10 years exist only on
  selected populations from research studies and are summarized in this art=
icle.
  In the former East Germany reporting of sexually transmitted infections (=
STIs)
  was mandatory and, due to the centralized organization, underreporting wa=
s
  considered to be low, although no specific studies have examined this. Af=
ter
  the unification in 1990 of the 2 German states the West German laws were
  adopted in East Germany. Since 1982, when the first acquired immune defic=
iency
  syndrome (AIDS) case was reported in Germany, information on AIDS cases h=
as
  voluntarily been collected at the national register at the AIDS Centre of=
 the
  Robert Koch Institute in Berlin. The law governing the reporting of infec=
tious
  diseases has recently been revised. Under the new Protection against Infe=
ction
  Act, which became effective on 1 January 2001, clinical diagnoses of STIs=
 (with
  the exception of hepatitis B) are no longer notifiable diseases. Laborato=
ry
  reporting of positive test results for Treponema pallidum has been introd=
uced.
  With T. pallidum and HIV notifications, additional disaggregated data are
  collected. Since T. pallidum and HIV remain the only notifiable STIs, all=
 other
  STIs have to be monitored through sentinel surveillance systems. These
  surveillance systems are currently being established. Under the new
  legislation, local health authorities have to provide adequate counsellin=
g and
  testing services for STIs, which may be provided free of charge if necess=
ary.

AB: A cross-sectional survey was conducted to evaluate the trend in human
  immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence among several sentinel population=
s in
  Thailand, in 2000. The sentinel populations with a sample size of 100-200=
 per
  group per province were selected and tested for HIV infection. The sentin=
el
  populations include commercial sex workers (CSWs; classified as direct CS=
Ws
  (brothel-based) and indirect CSWs (other sex establishments)), male atten=
dees
  at government sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics, pregnant women,
  injecting drug users (IDUs) and 21-year-old male conscripts. The median,
  maximum and minimum provincial HIV prevalence of each sentinel group, whi=
ch has
  a sample size of more than 20 subjects, were calculated to show national =
trend.
  Results revealed that the prevalences of HIV among indirect CSWs, male
  attendees at government STD clinics, pregnant women and 21-year-old male
  conscripts were 5.5, 5.9, 1.5 and 1.4%, respectively. Among IDUs, the
  prevalence decreased (47.2%) compared to previous years. Among direct CSW=
s, the
  prevalence was 18.5%, which is 2.5% higher than last year. It is conclude=
d that
  HIV prevalence among most sentinel groups show a decreasing trend this ye=
ar,
  except among direct CSWs.

g the

texts,
  to represent prevalence levels in the general population. In this paper, =
we
  examine the quality of ANC data collected in Thailand, a country that has=
 a
  high acclaimed sentinel surveillance system. Our review shows that ANC
  prevalence data should not be used uncritically. The data have a number o=
f
  limitations stemming from poor geographical coverage of surveillance site=
s,
  limited coverage of facilities, difference in the way data is collected, =
a lack
  of attention to selectivity based on fertility of ANC clients, and limite=
d
  attention to the relationship between male and female prevalence rates.
  However, the paper also suggests that these limitations can be addressed
  through careful assessment and adjustment of the data.

AB: Background: The current diagnostic criteria for paediatric autoimmune
  neuropsychiatric disorder associated with group A streptococcal infection
  (PANDAS) are paediatric onset, neuropsychiatric disorder (obsessive-compu=
lsive
  disorder (OCD)) and/or tic disorder; abrupt onset and/or episodic course =
of
  symptoms; association with group A beta-haemolytic streptococcal (GABHS)
  infection; and association with neurological abnormalities (motoric
  hyperactivity or adventitious movements, including choreiform movements o=
r
  tics). Objective: To assess new-onset PANDAS cases in relation to acute G=
ABHS
  tonsillopharyngitis at the Elmwood Pediatric Group, Rochester, New York, =
USA.
  Design: Prospective PANDAS case identification and follow-up. Results: Ov=
er a 3
  -year period (1998-2000), we identified 12 school-aged children (7 boys a=
nd 5
  girls) with new-onset PANDAS. Each patient had the abrupt appearance of s=
evere
  OCD behaviours, accompanied by mild symptoms and signs of acute GABHS
  tonsillopharyngitis. Throat swabs tested positive for GABHS by rapid anti=
gen
  detection and/or were culture positive. The GABHS serological tests, when
  performed (n=3D3), showed very high antideoxyribonuclease antibody titres=
. Mean
  age at presentation was 7 years (age range, 5-11 years). In children trea=
ted
  with antibiotics effective in eradicating GABHS infection at the sentinel
  episode, OCD symptoms promptly disappeared. Follow-up throat cultures neg=
ative
  for GABHS were obtained prospectively after the first PANDAS episode.
  Recurrence of OCD symptoms was seen in 6 patients; each recurrence was
  associated with evidence of acute GABHS infection and responded to antibi=
otic
  therapy, supporting the premise that these patients were not GABHS carrie=
rs.
  The OCD behaviours exhibited included hand washing and preoccupation with
  germs, but daytime urinary urgency and frequency without dysuria, fever o=
r
  incontinence were the most notable symptoms in our series (58% of patient=
s).
  Symptoms disappeared at night, and urinalysis and urine cultures were neg=
ative.
  Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study to conf=
irm
  that PANDAS is associated with acute GABHS tonsillopharyngitis and respon=
ds to
  appropriate antibiotic therapy at the sentinel episode.

  type H1N1 were reported at a Department of Defense influenza surveillance
  sentinel site in Lima, Peru. Genetic and antigenic analysis by
  haemagglutination inhibition and direct nucleotide sequencing of the HA1 =
region
  of the haemagglutinin gene were performed on 2 isolates, A/Peru/1641/99 a=
nd
  A/Peru/1798/99. Both isolates were distinct from the Bayern/7/95-like vir=
uses
  circulating in the Americas and closely related to a Beijing/262/95-like
  variant, A/New Caledonia/20/99. With the exception of travel-related case=
s, the
  detection of these isolates represents the first appearance of New
  Caledonia/20/99-like viruses in the Americas. Since the characterization =
of
  these Peru isolates, a number of New Caledonia/20/99-like viruses have be=
en
  reported worldwide. For the 2000/01 and 2001/02 influenza seasons, the Wo=
rld
  Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the inclusion of A/New
  Caledonia/20/99 as the H1N1 vaccine component for both the southern and
  northern hemispheres.

  variation in the Venezuelan Amazonia human onchocerciasis (Onchocerca vol=

  focus. Spatial and temporal variation in relative abundance, daily biting=
 rate,
  proportion of parous flies, and monthly parous biting rate were studied f=
or the
  3 main simuliid vectors (based on their vectorial competence: Simulium
  oyapockense sensu lato (s.l.), _S. incrustatum=ABS. guianense s.l.). Yano=
mami
  villages were selected among sentinel communities of the ivermectin contr=
ol
  programme, representing hypo- to hyperendemicity conditions of infection.
  Spatial variation was explored via increasing village altitude on 2 river
  systems (A: Ocamo-Putaco and B: Orinoco-Orinoquito). Temporal variation w=
as
  studied between 1995 and 1999 by sampling the biting population during dr=
y and
  rainy months. Environmental variables included monthly rainfall and maxim=
um
  river height. Simuliid species composition itself varied along the altitu=
dinal
  and prevalence gradient. S. oyapockense s.l. prevailed below 150 m. Above=
 this
  altitude and up to 240 m, S. incrustatum and S. guianense s.l. became mor=
e
  frequently and evenly collected along A but not along B, where S. incrust=
atum
  remained absent. The daily biting rate of S. oyapockense s.l. was higher =
during
  the dry season along A, whereas the converse took place along B. Daily bi=
ting
  rate of S. incrustatum was lowest during early rains. By contrast, the da=
ily
  biting rate of S. guianense s.l. was highest during this period. There wa=
s a
  significant negative cross-correlation between proportion of parous of S.
  oyapockense s.l. and river height (2 and 3 mo lagged), whereas this varia=
ble (1
  and 2 mo lagged) was positively correlated with the proportion of parous =
flies
  for S. incrustatum. Monthly parous biting rate values suggest that the mo=
nths
  contributing most to onchocerciasis transmission in the area are likely t=
o be
  the dry season and the transition periods between seasons.

AB: Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus first appeared in Australia in 1995, w=
hen 3
  clinical cases (2 fatal) were diagnosed in residents on Badu Island in th=
e
  Torres Strait, northern Queensland. More recently, 2 confirmed human JE c=
ases
  were reported in the Torres Strait Islands and Cape York Peninsula, in no=
rthern
  Queensland in 1998. Shortly after JE virus activity was detected in human=
s and
  sentinel pigs on Badu Island in 1998, adult mosquitoes were collected usi=
ng CO2
  and octenol-baited CDC light traps; 43 isolates of JE virus were recovere=
d.
  Although Culex sitiens group mosquitoes yielded the majority of JE isolat=
es
  (42), one isolate was also obtained from Ochlerotatus vigilax. Four isola=
tes of
  Ross River virus and 9 isolates of Sindbis (SIN) virus were also recovere=
d from
  members of the C. sitiens group collected on Badu Island in 1998. In addi=
tion,
  3240 mosquitoes were speciated and pooled after being anaesthetized with
  triethylamine (TEA). There was no significant difference in the minimum
  infection rate of mosquitoes anesthetized with TEA compared with those so=
rted
  on refrigerated tables (2.8 and 1.6 per 1000 mosquitoes, respectively).
  Nucleotide analysis of the premembrane region and an overlapping region o=
f the
  fifth nonstructural protein and 3' untranslated regions of representative=
 1998
  Badu Island isolates of JE virus revealed they were identical to each oth=
er.
  Between 99.1% and 100% identity was observed between 1995 and 1998 isolat=
es of
  JE from Badu Island, as well as isolates of JE from mosquitoes collected =
in
  Papua New Guinea in 1997 and 1998. This suggests that the New Guinea main=
land
  is the likely source of incursions of JE virus in Australia.

AB: Surveillance of infectious diseases is done in many countries. The aims=
 of
  such surveillance include the detection of epidemics. In the present stud=
y, the
  possibility of detecting an epidemic in its early stage using a simple me=
thod
  was evaluated for 16 infectious diseases. We used as an index the number =
of
  cases per week per sentinel medical institution in the area covered by a =
health
  centre in infectious disease surveillance in Japan in 1993-1997. Periods =
of
  epidemics in health centre areas were determined according to the reporte=
d
  indices. The simple method used for detecting the early stage of an epide=
mic is
  that if the index exceeds a critical value, then an epidemic will begin i=
n the
  following 4 weeks. The sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive v=
alue
  for this epidemic warning were evaluated for given critical values. When =
the
  specificity of the epidemic warning was more than 95%, the sensitivity wa=
s more
  than 60% in ten diseases, and more than 80% in four diseases (influenza-l=
ike
  illness, rubella, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, and herpangina). The posit=
ive
  predictive value was between 15.6% and 31.4% in these ten diseases. The e=
arly
  stage of epidemics of some infectious diseases might be detectable using =
this
  simple method.

AB: A sharp rise in the number of patients with infectious gastroenteritis =
was
  observed in the 25th week of year 1996 in the Takahashi-Ashin district by
  researchers with the Infectious Disease Surveillance Program for tubercul=
osis
  and other infectious diseases in the Okayama Prefecture. This sharp rise
  occurred coincidentally with an outbreak of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia=
 coli
  O157: H7 (EHEC O 157) infection in Niimi City of the Takahashi-Ashin dist=
rict.
  However, this phenomenon of coincidental outbreaks was not observed durin=
g the
  outbreak of EHEC O157 infection in Oku Cho. By reviewing outpatients' cha=
rts in
  a sentinel hospital in Niimi City for the Infectious Disease Surveillance
  Program, it was noted that patients with acute gastrointestinal infection
  visiting the hospital during the increased incidence of infectious
  gastroenteritis may have been included as misclassified cases of EHEC O15=
7
  infection. On the other hand, the exponential probability plotting of
  symptomatic patients with EHEC O157 infection in Niimi City revealed a br=
eaking
  point which suggested a dual exposure to contaminated food or an overlap =
with
  other acute gastrointestinal infections. The latter possibility was disco=
unted,
  because stool culture-positive patients with EHEC O157 infection also exh=
ibited
  a similar breaking point, and furthermore, the coincidental increase in
  infectious gastroenteritis in the same area was attributable to the EHEC =
O157
  infection. The present study demonstrates the association between the sha=
rp
  rise in gastroenteritis and the outbreak of EHEC O157 in the Takahashi-As=
hin
  district. A careful analysis of the cases of infectious gastroenteritis b=
y the
  Infectious Disease Surveillance Program would have predicted the outbreak=
 of
  EHEC O157.

AB: To study a novel surveillance system introduced in Mpumalanga Province,=
 a
  rural area in the north-east of South Africa, in an attempt to address
  deficiencies in the system of notification for infectious conditions that=
 have
  the potential for causing outbreaks. Hospital-based infection control nur=
ses in
  all of Mpumalanga's 32 public and private hospitals were trained to recog=
nize,
  report, and respond to nine clinical syndromes that require immediate act=
ion.
  Sustainability of the system was assured through a schedule of regular tr=
aining
  and networking, and by providing feedback to the nurses. The system was
  evaluated by formal review of hospital records, evidence of the effective
  containment of a cholera outbreak, and assessment of the speed and
  appropriateness of responses to other syndromes. Rapid detection, reporti=
ng and
  response to six imported cholera cases resulted in effective containment,=
 with
  only 19 proven secondary cholera cases, during the two-year review period=
. No
  secondary cases followed detection and prompt response to 14 patients wit=
h
  meningococcal disease. By the end of the first year of implementation, al=
l
  facilities were providing weekly zero-reports on the nine syndromes befor=
e the
  designated time. Formal hospital record review for cases of acute flaccid
  paralysis endorsed the value of the system. The primary goal of an outbre=
ak
  surveillance system is to ensure timely recognition of syndromes requirin=
g an
  immediate response. Infection control nurses in Mpumalanga hospitals have
  excelled in timely weekly zero-reporting, participation at monthly traini=
ng and
  feedback sessions, detection of priority clinical syndromes, and prompt
  appropriate response. This review provides support for the role of hospit=
al
  -based nurses as valuable sentinel surveillance agents providing timely d=

itored
  at representative wetland study sites in the Coachella, San Joaquin, and
  Sacramento valleys of California, USA from 1996 to 1998 using three metho=
ds:
  (1) virus isolation from pools of 50 host-seeking Culex tarsalis Coquille=
tt
  females, (2) seroconversions in flocks of 10 sentinel chickens, and (3)
  seroprevalence in wild birds collected by mist nets and grain baited trap=
s.
  Overall, 74 WEE and one SLE isolates were obtained from 222455 C. tarsali=
s
  females tested in 4988 pools. In addition, 133 and 40 seroconversions wer=
e
  detected in 28 chicken flocks, and 143 and 27 of 20192 sera tested from 1=
49
  species of wild birds were positive for antibodies to WEE and SLE,
  respectively. WEE was active in all three valleys, whereas SLE was detect=
ed
  only in Coachella Valley. Seroconversions in sentinel chickens provided t=
he
  most sensitive indication of enzootic activity and were correlated with
  seroprevalence rates in wild birds. Avian seroprevalence rates did not pr=
ovide
  an early warning of pending enzootic activity in chickens, because positi=
ve
  sera from after hatching year birds collected during spring most probably=
 were
  the result of infections acquired during the previous season. Few
  seroconversions were detected among banded recaptured birds collected dur=
ing
  spring and early summer. Age and resident status, but not sex, were signi=
ficant
  risk factors for wild bird infection, with the highest seroprevalence rat=
es
  among after hatching year individuals of permanent resident species. Migr=
ants
  (with the exception of mourning doves) and winter resident species were r=
arely
  positive. House finches (Carpodacus mexicanus), house sparrows (Passer
  domesticus), Gambel's quail (Callipepla gambelii), California quail (C.
  californicus), common ground doves (Columbina passerina), and mourning do=
ves
  (Zenaida macroura) were most frequently positive for antibodies. The init=
ial
  detection of enzootic activity each summer coincided closely with the
  appearance of hatching year birds of these species in our study areas, pe=
rhaps
  indicating their role in virus amplification. Bird species most frequentl=
y
  positive roosted or nested in elevated upland vegetation, sites where C.
  tarsalis host-seeking females hunt most frequently. These serosurveys pro=
vided
  important background information for planned host competence and chronic

AB: Four general frequencies of human St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus
  (epidemic, focal, sporadic), and no transmission occurred in Florida, USA
  between 1990 and 1999. An epidemic with 226 clinical cases and 11 deaths =
was
  reported from 28 Florida counties between July 1990 and January 1991. Dur=
ing
  the autumn of 1993, a focal outbreak was reported from Lee (5 cases) and
  Collier (3) Counties in southwest Florida. During the autumn of 1997, spo=
radic
  transmission to nine humans was reported from five Florida counties (Brev=
ard, 1
  case; Polk, 3; Charlotte, 1; Lee, 2; and Palm Beach, 2). Human infection =
with
  SLE virus depends on a number of variables that drive virus transmission.=
 These
  include vector, virus, and avian host abundance, and meteorological event=
s,
  especially rainfall. We monitored the abundance and serological status of=
 wild
  avian amplification hosts, virus isolations from Culex nigripalpus female=
s, and
  SLE virus transmission to sentinel chickens during 1990, 1993, and 1997. =
The
  epidemic of 1990 was characterized by conditions that produced an unusual
  abundance of vector mosquitoes and avian amplification hosts early in the=
 year.
  We propose that epidemics may result when a specific combination of bioti=
c and
  abiotic conditions favour SLE virus minimum field infection rates that ap=
proach

AB: Many countries are currently studying the possibility of mass vaccinati=
on
  against varicella. This study was conducted to provide a comprehensive pi=
cture
  of the pre-vaccination epidemiology of the varicella zoster virus (VZV), =
to aid
  in the design of immunization programmes and to adequately measure the im=
pact
  of vaccination. Population-based data, including physician visit claims,
  sentinel surveillance and hospitalization data, from Canada and UK during=
 the
  period 1979-97 were analysed. The key epidemiological characteristics of
  varicella and zoster (age specific consultation rates, seasonality, force=
 of
  infection, hospitalization rates and inpatient days) were compared. Resul=
ts
  showed that the overall epidemiology of varicella and zoster was remarkab=
ly
  similar between the two countries. The major difference being that, contr=
ary to
  Canada, the epidemiology of varicella seems to be changing in UK, with an
  important decrease in the average age at infection that coincides with a
  significant increase in children attending preschool. Furthermore, differ=
ences
  exist in the seasonality between UK and Canada, which seem to be primaril=
y due
  to the school calendar. These results illustrate that school and preschoo=
l
  contact patterns play an important role in the dynamics of varicella. Fin=
ally,
  our results provide baseline estimates of varicella and zoster incidence =
and
  morbidity for VZV vaccine effectiveness and cost-effectiveness studies.

AB: A study was conducted to determine Schistosoma japonicum infectivity at
  different water levels during and after flooding in the Dongting Lake and=
 the
  Yangtze River in China. One field was selected in the eastern Dongting La=
ke and
  one in the Yangtze River. A regular test of infection was made, using a g=
roup
  of sentinel mice at four different water levels, in August and September =
1998.
  In eastern Dongting Lake, the infection rates at risk, cautionary, flood
  prevention and perennial water levels were 7.7, 0, 7.5 and 100%, respecti=
vely.
  In the Yangtze River, the corresponding figures were 43.6, 20.0, 47.5 and=
 7.6%.
  It is concluded that the water in both areas was infective at different w=
ater
  levels. The infection rates in the Yangtze River were higher than those o=
f the
  eastern Dongting Lake when the water level was falling. The worm burdens =
of the
  two areas were very low (0.60-2.26 worms/mouse). When the water level fel=
l to
  the perennial water level, the infection rate of Dongting Lake was marked=

AB: Ixodes spinipalpis maintains Borrelia bissettii spirochaetes in Colorad=
o,
  USA in a cycle involving wood rats and deer mice. This tick has been desc=
ribed
  as nidicolous, remaining either attached to its rodent hosts or in the ro=
dent
  nest. Nidicolous ticks pose little risk of pathogen transmission to human=
s if
  they do not actively quest for hosts. To investigate the questing potenti=
al of
  I. spinipalpis, sentinel mice were placed in an area where I. spinipalpis=
 had
  been commonly found on wood rats and deer mice. Concurrently, wild rodent
  populations were trapped and analysed for Lyme disease spirochaetes, the =
agent
  of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (aoHGE), and Babesia microti. A total =
of 122
  I. spinipalpis larvae and 10 nymphs were found on 19% of 244 sentinel mic=
e. In
  addition, 4 sentinel mice became infested with Malaraeus telchinus or Orc=
hopeas
  neotomae fleas. Questing I. spinipalpis were positively associated with w=
oody
  shrubs and negatively associated with sunny and grassy areas. Four sentin=
el
  mice became infected with aoHGE after having been fed upon only by I.
  spinipalpis larvae. One sentinel mouse became infected with B. bissettii =
after
  having an I. spinipalpis nymph feed on it, and one sentinel mouse became
  coinfected with aoHGE and B. bissettii after it was fed upon by a single =
I.
  spinipalpis nymph. These sentinel mouse conversions suggest the possibili=
ty
  that the aoHGE is transovarially transmitted by I. spinipalpis, and that =
I.
  spinipalpis is capable of simultaneously transmitting B. bissettii and th=
e
  aoHGE. The findings that I. spinipalpis quest away from rodent nests and =
will
  attach to and infect sentinel mice may be of public health importance. It
  suggests the potential transmission of the agents of human granulocytic
  ehrlichiosis and Lyme disease to other hosts by I. spinipalpis, in region=
s of
  the western USA where Ixodes pacificus is not found.

  type 1 outbreak in 1993. The lessons learnt from each of these epidemics =
have
  guided us to modify and improve our polio eradication activities. Current=
ly,
  these activities include administration of five primary and three booster=
 doses
  of trivalent oral polio vaccine, yearly national immunization campaigns (=
NIDs)
  since 1995 with coverage of > 90%, localized immunization campaigns, acut=
e
  flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance which involves reporting of all case=
s by
  facsimile to the Department of Surveillance within 24 h of detecting a ca=
se and
  weekly zero reporting from 22 sentinel sites, and virological testing of =
faecal
  specimens of all AFP cases and their close contacts at the national, Worl=
d
  Health Organization accredited laboratory. The cumulative success of thes=
e
  activities has resulted in Oman being free from polio for the past 6 year=
s.
  However, the possibility of importation of wild poliovirus, particularly =
from

AB: The persistence of syphilis in the United States suggests that a better
  understanding is needed of the potential for various public health approa=
ches
  to prevent the spread of the disease. The authors conducted surveys of 92
  persons with early syphilis, 56 uninfected sexual contacts, and 143
  neighbourhood controls in the Baton Rouge, Louisiana, area. The surveys
  collected information regarding sexual behaviour, access to and use of he=
alth
  care services, encounters at sites at which serological screening for syp=
hilis
  could be done, and exposure to interventions designed to prevent HIV infe=
ction.
  All groups reported high-risk sexual behaviour. Cases and contacts were m=
ore
  likely than controls to report two or more sex partners in the previous y=
ear,
  but the three groups were similar in the percentage reporting five or mor=
e sex
  partners. Cases had poor access to health care and by some measures this =
access
  was less than that of controls. The potential screening site visited most
  frequently by cases was the public hospital emergency room (40%). Cases w=
ere
  less likely to have been exposed to programmes designed to prevent HIV
  infection than uninfected contacts and controls combined (odds ratios, 0.=
51
  -0.66). Persons with syphilis were not unlike others in their neighbourho=
ods,
  suggesting that syphilis is a sentinel event that indicates an entire
  neighbourhood is at risk. Improvements in access to health care for sexua=
lly
  transmitted disease-related symptoms, screening in sites such as public
  hospital emergency rooms, and emphasizing sexual risk-reduction intervent=
ions
  may limit the spread of syphilis in these neighbourhoods. To prevent syph=
ilis
  in the long term, public health programmes should also try to better unde=
rstand
  and change other community-level socioeconomic factors that influence sex=
ual
  behaviour.

AB: A study was conducted to evaluate the impact of human immunodeficiency =
virus
  (HIV) infection on fertility among women attending antenatal clinics in B=
obo
  -Dioulasso (Burkina Faso) and its possible implications on HIV sentinel
  surveillance. Voluntary counselling and HIV testing were proposed to 1349=
 women
  aged _18 years who were carrying a pregnancy of 7 months or less. During =
pre
  -test counselling sessions, a standardized questionnaire was administered=
 to
  collect detailed information regarding socio-demographic characteristics =
and
  obstetrical history. After written informed consent, blood samples were t=
aken
  for HIV testing. Mean age (=B1standard deviation) at first sexual interco=
urse was
  similar among HIV-positive (n=3D83) and -negative (n=3D1336) women (16.7=
=B12 and
  16.9=B12 years, respectively). However, HIV-positive women aged _25 years=
 (n=3D37)
  had, on the average, fewer pregnancies than HIV-negative women (n=3D567) =
of the
  same age (3.8=B11.5 and 5.0=B12.3, respectively; P < 0.01). Similarly, th=
ese HIV
  -positive women (n=3D35) had, on the average, less live births than HIV-n=
egative
  ones (n=3D555) (2.8=B11.3 and 3.7=B12.1), respectively; (P=3D0.02). Other=
 sexual and
  obstetrical characteristics, i.e. maternal age, proportion of primigravid=
a,
  stillbirths, spontaneous abortions, were comparable in the two groups. Th=
ese
  data suggest that the level of fertility of HIV-positive women aged _25 y=
ears
  is significantly lower than HIV-negative women. Thus, HIV-positive women =
in
  this age group are likely to be under-represented among antenatal clinic
  attendees. In order to derive a good estimate of community HIV prevalence=
,
  adjustment of antenatal clinic-based HIV sentinel surveillance data for a=
ge and
  fertility is suggested.

AB: Objectives: As an alternative to statewide, mandated surveillance for
  antibiotic-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, a sentinel surveillance ne=
twork
  of 27 hospitals was developed in Washington State, USA. Methods: The util=
ity of
  targeted surveillance in population centres was assessed, current laborat=
ory
  susceptibility testing practices were evaluated, and a baseline of pneumo=
coccal
  resistance in Washington State was obtained for use in a statewide campai=
gn
  promoting the judicious use of antibiotics. Results: Between July 1997 an=
d June
  1998, a total of 300 cases were reported; 67 (22%) had diminished
  susceptibility to penicillin. Only 191 (64%) were fully tested with penic=
illin
  and an extended-spectrum cephalosporin (ESC) as nationally recommended; 1=
0.5%
  were resistant to penicillin and 6.8% were resistant to an ESC. The numbe=
r of
  isolates inadequately tested declined through the year. The findings were
  similar to those from more comprehensive active surveillance in Oregon fo=
r the
  same time period. Conclusions: Targeted surveillance may be an adequate
  alternative for limited monitoring of antibiotic resistance for states th=
at
  choose not to mandate reporting.

  administration. For effective coverage 4000 drug distributors were select=
ed and
  trained, each responsible for drug administration in 50 households. A sur=
vey to
  assess the drug coverage rate was carried out one week after the drug
  distribution. 39 sites in the 2 islands were randomly selected and 600-90=
0
  people per site were interviewed, giving a total number of 26143 people. =
The
  results showed an overall drug coverage rate of 76% (79% in Uguja and 71%=
 in
  Pemba, which reflect the 92.1% and 85.6% of people who swallowed the drug=
s
  among the eligible population, respectively). Eight percent of the people=
 who
  swallowed the drugs reported side effects.

AB: Objectives: To assess therapeutic efficacy of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine=
 (SP)
  in treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria 3 years after
  introduction in Mpumalanga, South Africa. Setting: Tonga district with a
  population of 116418 and subject to seasonal malaria, with an average ann=
ual
  incidence of 3200 cases. Subjects: 119 malaria patients presenting to a
  sentinel surveillance clinic and recruited according to World Health
  Organisation (WHO) criteria between January and May 2000. Methodology: Pa=
tients
  satisfying WHO inclusion criteria were treated with a single oral dose of=
 SP
  and the response of infection to treatment in each patient was routinely
  monitored clinically and parasitologically on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28=
 and
  42 post-treatment. 110 patients completed follow-up to day 42 or evidence=
 of
  clinical or parasitological failure. Results: The cure rate at day 42 was=
 93.6%
  (103/110). Two patients (1.8%, RII) were early treatment failures on day =
3,
  while recrudescence (4.5%, RI) occurred in 5 patients on day 28 (N=3D3) a=
nd on
  day 42 (N=3D2). Conclusion: In Mpumalanga P. falciparum remains sensitive=
 to SP,
  with no significant difference between the baseline cure rate (94.5%) and=
 the
  cure rate in the present study (93.6%).

 the

  activity in the Australasian region was first demonstrated by the isolati=
on of
  JE virus from 3 sentinel pigs on Badu Island in the Torres Strait. Furthe=

of
  specific JE virus neutralizing antibodies in 3 pigs from Saint Pauls comm=
unity
  on Moa Island. Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of the
  premembrane and envelope genes were performed which showed that both the =
pig
  and mosquito JE virus isolates (TS00 and TS4152, respectively) clustered =
in
  genotype I, along with northern Thai, Cambodian, and Korean isolates. All
  previous Australasian JE virus isolates belong to genotype II, along with
  Malaysian and Indonesian isolates. Therefore, for the first time, the
  appearance and transmission of a 2nd genotype of JE virus in the Australa=
sian
  region has been demonstrated.

AB: The first reports of West Nile virus (WNV) infection in the United Stat=
es in
  1999 prompted Ontario to establish a surveillance protocol to monitor for=
 the
  possible spread of the virus into the province. Surveillance components
  included evaluation of dead birds, sentinel fowls, mosquito pools and hum=
an
  disease. We report the results of human surveillance in 2000. Between 1 J=
uly
  and 31 October 2000, an active surveillance programme was undertaken in w=
hich
  designated site coordinators in sentinel hospitals identified patients wh=
o met
  the suspect case definition (fever and fluctuating level of consciousness=
 or
  encephalopathy, with or without muscle weakness). During the same period,
  following province-wide distribution of educational material, all other
  patients tested for WNV antibodies were identified through review of prov=
incial
  laboratory reports (laboratory-based enhanced passive surveillance). Of 6=
0
  hospitals contacted, 59 agreed to participate in the active surveillance
  programme; 52 provided information on a regular (weekly) basis and 7 subm=
itted
  fewer than 8 reports. Thirty-six (61%) of the sentinel sites reported sus=
pect
  cases. In total, 188 patients were tested (130 identified through active
  surveillance and 58 through enhanced passive surveillance). Patients iden=
tified
  through active surveillance were more likely than those identified throug=
h
  passive surveillance to meet the suspect case definition (43% [n=3D56] vs=
. 7%
  [n=3D4]), to be admitted to hospital (75% [n=3D99] vs. 16% [n=3D9]), to h=
ave a longer
  hospital stay (mean 25 vs. 3 days), to have had a second (convalescent) s=
erum
  sample collected (37%; n=3D48 vs. 31%; n=3D18), to have had a cerebrospin=
al fluid
  (CSF) sample banked (56%; n=3D73 vs. 14%; n=3D8) and to have had a discha=
rge
  diagnosis reported (79%; n=3D103 vs. 28%; n=3D16). Of 60 patients (32%) w=
ho met the
  suspect case definition, 34 (57%; 31 active, 3 passive) had a discharge
  diagnosis of encephalitis. Of these, 17 (50%; 15 active, 2 passive) had p=
aired
  serum samples collected, and 18 (51%; all active) had a CSF sample banked=
. The
  reported causal agents were herpes simplex virus (n=3D8), varicella virus=
 (n=3D2),
  Powassan virus (n=3D1), echovirus 30 (n=3D1) and group B Streptococcus (n=
=3D1); the
  cause was unknown in 18 cases. One patient died of encephalitis. The rema=
ining
  26 patients who met the suspect case definition were ultimately found to =
have
  nonencephalitic infections, vascular events or alcohol- or drug-related
  illness. The 128 (68%) tested for WNV who did not meet the suspect case
  definition included 9 patients ultimately discharged with a diagnosis of
  encephalitis. No cases of WNV infection were identified. Only one-third o=
f the
  tested patients met the suspect case definition of encephalopathy on admi=
ssion,
  and nearly half of them were later found to have another diagnosis; other=
s did
  not meet the case definition but were later discharged with a diagnosis o=
f
  encephalitis. This affirms that identification of acute encephalitis on t=
he
  basis of symptoms at the time of admission is often impossible.

AB: During a large-scale treatment programme for the control of urinary
  schistosomiasis in Niger, rapid assessment indicators were evaluated to
  determine the impact of praziquantel on morbidity and when further treatm=
ent is
  required. In 10 villages from 5 different irrigation areas, the urine of =
all
  children aged 7-15 years was examined macroscopically before mass treatme=
nt and
  3 years after intervention. At the same times, children attending (sentin=
el)
  schools in the villages were subjected to parasitological (oviuria) and
  clinical (macroscopic aspect of urine and microhaematuria) examination, a=
nd
  ultrasonography was used to measure the level of morbidity before treatme=
nt,
  the impact of treatment and changes in prevalence and morbidity during th=
e 3
  years following treatment. Rapid assessment indicators, in particular the
  macroscopic aspect of urine (cloudy versus bloody), clearly reflected the
  development of parasitological and ultrasonographic indicators after trea=
tment
  with praziquantel. Cloudy urine indicated the prevalence of infection, wh=
ile
  bloody urine indicated morbidity due to Schistosoma haematobium. Agreemen=
t
  between the results obtained in the sentinel schools and village children=
 made
  it possible to organize a monitoring system using these rapid assessment
  indicators in an area endemic for S. haematobium.

  survey of agricultural and surrounding populations in Clermon-Ferrand, Fr=
ance
  and a microbiological survey of irrigation water quality were carried out=
 to
  assess the safety of the treated waste water (replacing surface water) be=
ing
  used for crop irrigation. Four information systems were set up: 2 sentine=
l
  systems joining 15 general physicians and 7 pharmacists for the surroundi=
ng
  population, and 2 follow-up surveys among field workers and farmers. Aero=
sols
  from spray irrigation were also studied. No epidemic event was identified=
 with
  only some case clusters (not related to water exposure) being observed. A=
ll the
  declared cases were benign. Surveys among workers revealed substantial
  incidence of nettle rashes, itchy skins, sunburns and cuts. A follow-up s=
tudy
  among farmers and their families did not reveal any incidence. The
  bacteriological quality of treated waste waterconformed with the
  recommendations of the Superior Council of Public Health (1000 faecal
  coliforms/100 ml). No faecal bacteria were observed in aerosols with wate=
r
  concentrations of 103 colony forming unit/100 ml and an exposure time of =
20
  minutes.

AB: Mechanisms for monitoring Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) virus activi=
ty
  include surveillance of human cases, surveillance for activity in sentine=
l
  animals, monitoring of mosquito vectors and monitoring of weather conditi=
ons.
  The monitoring of human cases is only one possible trigger for public hea=
lth
  action and the additional surveillance systems are used in concert to sig=
nal
  the risk of human disease, often before the appearance of human cases. Mo=
squito
  vector surveillance includes mosquito trapping for speciation and enumera=
tion
  of mosquitoes to monitor population sizes and relative composition. Virus
  isolation from mosquitoes can also be undertaken. Monitoring of weather
  conditions and vector surveillance determines whether there is a potentia=
l for
  MVE activity to occur. Virus isolation from trapped mosquitoes is necessa=
ry to
  define whether MVE is actually present, but is difficult to deliver in a =
timely
  fashion in some jurisdictions. Monitoring of sentinel animals indicates w=
hether
  MVE transmission to vertebrates is actually occurring. Meteorological
  surveillance can assist in the prediction of potential MVE virus activity=
 by
  signalling conditions that have been associated with outbreaks of Murray =
Valley
  encephalitis in humans in the past. Predictive models of MVE virus activi=
ty for
  south-eastern Australia have been developed, but due to the infrequency o=
f
  outbreaks, are yet to be demonstrated as useful for the forecasting of ma=
jor
  outbreaks. Surveillance mechanisms vary across the jurisdictions. Surveil=
lance
  of human disease occurs in all States and Territories by reporting of cas=
es to
  health authorities. Sentinel flocks of chickens are maintained in 4
  jurisdictions (Western Australia, the Northern Territory, Victoria and Ne=
w
  South Wales) with collaborations between Western Australia and the Northe=
rn
  Territory. Mosquito monitoring complements the surveillance of sentinel a=
nimals
  in these jurisdictions. In addition, other mosquito monitoring programmes=
 exist
  in other States (including South Australia and Queensland). Public health
  control measures may include advice to the general public and mosquito
  management programmes to reduce the numbers of both mosquito larvae and a=
dult
  vectors. Strategic plans for public health action in the event of MVE vir=
us
  activity are currently developed or being developed in New South Wales, t=
he
  Northern Territory, South Australia, Western Australia and Victoria. A so=
uthern
  tri-State agreement exists between health departments of New South Wales,
  Victoria and South Australia and the Commonwealth Department of Health an=
d Aged
  Care. All partners have agreed to co-operate and provide assistance in
  predicting and combatting outbreaks of mosquito-borne disease in south-ea=
stern
  Australia. The newly formed National Arbovirus Advisory Committee is a wo=
rking
  party providing advice to the Communicable Diseases Network Australia on
  arbovirus surveillance and control. Recommendations for further enhanceme=

AB: The presence of environmental contaminants in air, water and food may p=
ose
  significant health risks to the exposed human population. However, proble=
ms
  associated with assessing chronic exposure to low doses of environmental
  chemicals, multiple exposure routes, diseases with long latency periods, =
and
  non-specific health outcomes make it difficult to conduct the appropriate=
 human
  epidemiological studies. It may be useful to complement human epidemiolog=
y with
  animal studies. Animals monitored or evaluated in situ for the appropriat=
e
  suite of endpoints can provide information about both exposure levels and
  potential adverse health effects. Animals have served as sentinel indicat=
ors
  for health effects associated with a number of environmental exposures,
  including pesticides and asbestos. Pet dogs may be particularly valuable
  sentinels because they share the human environment. In addition, dogs res=
pond
  to many toxic insults in ways analogous to humans, they have physiologica=
lly
  compressed life spans, and they are free from some important lifestyle ri=
sk
  factors for disease. An example of how pet dogs may be used as sentinels =
for
  potential human health hazards involves a study of the genotoxic effects
  resulting from exposure to a mixture of chemicals from nearby Superfund s=
ites.
  We conducted a cross-sectional study of exposed dogs (living in the commu=
nity
  with the Superfund sites) and controls (living in a nearby community). Th=
e pet
  owners completed a questionnaire, and we collected a blood sample from ea=
ch
  dog. The blood samples were analysed for standard clinical parameters and
  assays for possible genotoxic effects (peripheral blood lymphocyte micron=
ucleus
  frequency and lymphocyte subtyping). Pet dogs living near the Superfund s=
ites
  had a higher micronucleus frequency than control animals, suggesting that=
 the
  dogs may have been exposed to environmental contaminants from these sites=

AB: The disease burden of rotavirus diarrhoea in Vietnam was assessed by
  surveillance of children < 5 years old who were hospitalized for diarrhoe=
a at 3
  centres in the north and 3 centres in the south. Rotavirus was identified=
 in
  56% (range, 47%-60%) of the 5768 patients surveyed between July 1998 and =
June
  2000. G-typing of the first 224 strains indicated that only 2% were non
  -typeable, 9% were in mixed infections, and the remainder were of the com=
mon
  serotypes G1, G2, G3, G4, and G9. In Vietnam, diarrhoea accounts for 9880
  deaths per year, which is ~15% of all deaths among children < 5 years old=
, or
  6.5 deaths per 1000 children. If even 50% of these diarrhoea-related deat=
hs in
  Vietnam were due to rotavirus, the number would represent 4%-8% of all de=
aths
  among children < 5 years old, 2700-5400 rotavirus-related deaths per year=

AB: Between 1978 and 1988 Plasmodium falciparum resistance to chloroquine h=
as
  been reported in all countries of tropical Africa. Despite the intensific=

  of resistance during the last 2 decades, chloroquine remains in 2000 the =
first
  -line treatment for malaria in most of these countries. Here we review
  published data on the public health impact of antimalarial drug resistanc=
e in
  Africa. These data show that since the late 1980s convincing evidence of =
a
  major public health impact of the spread of chloroquine resistance has be=
en
  available. Hospital studies in various African countries have documented =
a 2-
  or 3-fold increase in malaria deaths and admissions for severe malaria, a=
n
  increase temporally related to the emergence of chloroquine resistance. D=
ata
  from sentinel demographic surveillance systems in Senegal indicated that
  mortality attributable to malaria in children increased by as much as 6-f=
old
  among populations where low levels of malaria mortality had been achieved
  because of efficient health services before the emergence of chloroquine
  resistance. Increasing incidence of severe malarial anaemia also contribu=
ted to
  human immunodeficiency virus dissemination. The dramatic impact of chloro=
quine
  resistance on malaria mortality has long been underestimated because only=
 a low
  proportion of malaria attacks are potentially lethal among persons contin=
uously
  exposed since birth to high levels of transmission. There is an urgent ne=
ed to
  change treatment policies in Africa.

AB: During 1997-98, we investigated the possible continuous circulation of
  epizootic Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus suggested by a 1983
  subtype IC interepizootic mosquito isolate made in Panaquire, Miranda Sta=
te,
  Venezuela. The study area was originally covered by lowland tropical rain=
forest
  but has been converted into cacao plantations. Sentinel hamsters, small m=
ammal
  trapping, mosquito collections, and human serosurveys were used to detect
  active or recent virus circulation. Six strains of subtype ID VEE virus w=
ere
  isolated from hamsters that displayed no apparent disease. Four other
  arboviruses belonging to group A (Togaviridae: Alphavirus), two Bunyamwer=
a
  group (Bunyaviridae), and three Gamboa group (Bunyaviridae) arboviruses w=
ere
  also isolated from hamsters, as well as 8 unidentified viruses. Venezuela=
n
  equine encephalitis-specific antibodies were detected in 5 small mammal
  species: Proechimys guairae, Marmosa spp., and Didelphis marsupialis. Mos=
quito
  collections comprised of 38 different species, including 8 members of the
  subgenus Culex, did not yield any virus isolates. Sera from 195 humans, e=
ither
  workers in the cacao plantation or nearby residents, were all negative fo=
r VEE
  virus antibodies. Sequences of 1677 nucleotides from the P62 gene of 2 vi=
rus
  isolates indicated that they represent a subtype ID lineage that is disti=
nct
  from all others characterized previously, and are unrelated to epizootic =
VEE
  emergence. The VEE virus sequences are deposited in the GenBank library u=

AB: The objectives of this study were to monitor the trends of the HIV epid=
emic
  between 1995 and 1999 among pregnant women in Bobo-Dioulasso, the second
  largest town of Burkina Faso, and to discuss the possible effect of preve=
ntive
  interventions (condom availability) on sexual transmission of HIV in this
  context. Age-specific trends in HIV prevalence obtained from sentinel
  surveillance programme were analysed. Among antenatal clinic attendees, H=
IV
  prevalence was 7.5% (n=3D401) in 1995, 10% (n=3D200) in 1996, 7.6% (n=3D4=
48) in 1997,
  8.4% (n=3D642) in 1998 and 5.3% (n=3D716) in 1999 without demonstrated te=
mporal
  trend (P=3D0.12). The average number of condoms available per person (age=
d 15-49
  years) per year increased from 0.6 in 1992 to 5.7 in 1995 and 6.0 in 1999=
.
  Anonymous surveys are less subject to selection bias and suggest a
  stabilization of the HIV prevalence around 7.3% in Bobo-Dioulasso. Distri=
bution
  of condoms could explain at least, partly, this stabilization of the HIV
  epidemic.

  HIV/AIDS epidemics in adults in sub-Saharan Africa, with examples from

 the
  magnitude and trajectory of the HIV/AIDS epidemic is essential for planni=

  evaluating control strategies. Previous mathematical models were develope=
d to
  estimate epidemic trends based on sentinel surveillance data from pregnan=
t
  women. In this project, we have extended these models in order to take fu=
ll
  advantage of the available data. We developed a maximum likelihood approa=
ch for
  the estimation of model parameters and used numerical simulation methods =
to
  compute uncertainty intervals around the estimates. In the 4 countries
  analysed, there were an estimated half a million new adult HIV infections=
 in
  1999 (range: 260 to 960 thousand), 4.7 million prevalent infections (rang=
e: 3.0
  to 6.6 million), and 370 thousand adult deaths from AIDS (range: 266 to 4=
92
  thousand). While this project addresses some of the limitations of previo=
us
  modelling efforts, an important research agenda remains, including the ne=
ed to
  clarify the relationship between sentinel data from pregnant women and th=

  rotavirus-associated medical visits and hospitalizations was conducted du=

  1997-98 at three large sentinel public hospitals, one each in Argentina, =

  39%/71% in Argentina, 34%/47% in Chile and 29%/38% in Venezuela (P < 0.01=

  hospitalizations among children < 36 months of age at the Argentinean, Ch=

  and Venezuelan sites, respectively. Seasonality was evident for medical v=
isits
  at all three sites (although less striking in Chile) with peak activity
  occurring between November and May. Rotavirus-associated hospitalizations=
 had a
  marked peak in Venezuela, represented largely by short stays, but not in
  Argentina and Chile. Rotavirus was a significant cause of medical visits =
at all
  three sentinel sites. Rotavirus caused less hospitalizations than previou=

  reported in Argentina and Chile. Based on the results, it is estimated th=
at
  _106000/21000, 48000/8000 and 98000/31000 rotavirus-associated medical
  visits/hospitalizations occur yearly in Argentina, Chile and Venezuela,

  health facility surveillance showed an increase in mumps after 2 school
  immunization campaigns in western Suriname and a mass immunization campai=
gn in
  the same region. There was also an increase in a geographically separate =
region
  following a mass campaign with the same vaccine. Among the schoolchildren=
 who
  were interviewed, the attack rate for mumps in those immunized was 15.1%,=
 and
  among those whom were not immunized was 4.7%. In the affected males, the =
attack
  rate for orchitis was 5 of 19 (21%). Assuming 90% protection by the MMR
  vaccine, the incidence ratio (observed to expected) was 32. The mumps out=
break
  was caused by an inadequately attenuated MMR vaccine. Because this vaccin=
e had
  not been used in these populations before in Suriname, it was not possibl=
e to
  determine wether the outbreak was due the virulence of the Leningrad-Zagr=

AB: The objective of this paper was to analyse the quality of human
  immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)
  sentinel surveillance systems in countries and the resulting quality of t=
he
  data used to make estimates of HIV/AIDS prevalence and mortality. Availab=
le
  data on sero-surveillance of HIV/AIDS in countries were compiled in the p=
rocess
  of making the end of 1999 estimates of HIV/AIDS. These data came primaril=
y from
  the HIV/AIDS Surveillance Database developed by the United States Census
  Bureau, from a database maintained by the European Centre for the
  Epidemiological Monitoring of AIDS and all country reports on sentinel
  surveillance that had been provided to World Health Organization or UNAID=
S.
  Procedures were developed to score quality of surveillance systems based =
on 4
  dimensions of quality: timeliness and frequency; appropriateness of group=
s;
  consistency of sites over time; and coverage provided by the system. In t=
otal,
  the surveillance systems from 167 countries were analysed. 47 of the 167
  countries whose surveillance systems were rated were judged to have fully
  implemented sentinel surveillance systems; 51 were judged to have systems=
 that
  had some or most aspects of a good HIV surveillance system in place and 6=
9 were
  rated as having poorly functioning or non-existent surveillance systems. =
This
  analysis suggests that the quality of HIV surveillance varies considerabl=
y. The
  majority of countries most affected by HIV/AIDS have systems that are pro=
viding
  sufficient sero-prevalence data for tracking the epidemic and making reas=
onable
  estimates of HIV prevalence. However, many countries have poor systems an=
d
  strengthening these is an urgent priority.

AB: To better understand the epidemiology of methicillin-resistant S. aureu=
s
  (MRSA) in Canadian hospitals, surveillance has been conducted in sentinel
  hospitals across the country since 1995. We report the results of the fir=
st 5
  years of the programme. For each newly identified inpatient with MRSA, me=
dical
  records were reviewed for demographic and clinical data. Isolates were
  subjected to susceptibility testing and molecular typing by pulsed-field =
gel
  electrophoresis. A total of 4507 patients infected or colonized with MRSA=
 were
  identified between January 1995 and December 1999. The rate of MRSA incre=
ased
  each year from a mean of 0.95 per 100 S. aureus isolates in 1995 to 5.97 =
per
  100 isolates in 1999 (0.46 per 1000 admissions in 1995 to 4.12 per 1000
  admissions in 1999) (P < 0.05). Most of the increase in MRSA occurred in
  Ontario, Quebec and the western provinces. Of the 3009 cases for which th=
e site
  of MRSA acquisition could be determined, 86% were acquired in a hospital,=
 8%
  were acquired in a long-term care facility and 6% were acquired in the
  community. A total of 1603 patients (36%) were infected with MRSA. The mo=
st
  common sites of infection were skin or soft tissue (25% of MRSA infection=
s),
  pulmonary tissues (24%) and surgical sites (23%); 13% of the patients wer=
e
  bacteraemic. An epidemiological link with a previously identified MRSA pa=
tient
  was suspected in 53% of the cases. Molecular typing indicated that most (=
81%)
  of the isolates could be classified as related to 1 of the 4 Canadian epi=
demic
  strains of MRSA. There has been a significant increase in the rate of iso=
lating
  MRSA in many Canadian hospitals, related to the transmission of a relativ=
ely
  small number of MRSA strains.

AB: The cost effectiveness of enzootic arbovirus (western equine encephalit=
is
  and St Louis encephalitis viruses) surveillance methods in northern Calif=
ornia,
  i.e antibody detection in sentinel chickens, virus isolation from mosquit=
oes
  and antibody detection in wild avian hosts, was compared. Total and annua=
l
  recurring costs were determined for each method based on estimated person=
nel
  and actual material and travel costs for biweekly surveillance at 3 sites=
 in
  the Sacramento Valley from 1 May to mid-October 1997 and 1998. Serologica=
l
  detection of antibodies in wild birds was the most expensive method. Tota=
l
  costs associated with sentinel chickens and mosquitoes combined were less=
 than
  half of those for the wild bird program. Recurring annual costs for the w=
ild
  bird and mosquito methods were only slightly less than expenses for those
  methods during the first year of operation, which included nonrecurring s=
etup
  costs. Recurring costs for sentinel chickens were reduced ~40% from total=
 costs
  during the first year of the programme and were < 14% of recurring costs =
for
  wild bird serology. Exceptions and caveats of our analysis are discussed.=
 When
  considering the data from a companion paper on detection of enzootic viru=
s
  transmission using the 3 methods, it is concluded that the current system=
 that
  combines sentinel chickens and virus isolation from mosquitoes is the mos=
t cost
  -effective and efficient surveillance programme and should be retained. F=
uture
  research efforts should investigate the costs and surveillance efficiency=
 of
  modifications in the frequency of specimen collection and the placement o=

AB: A rapid microtitre cell enzyme immuno assay (cell-EIA) was developed fo=
r the
  detection of influenza A subtypes in nasopharyngeal(NPS) swabs taken for
  surveillance. During the 1997-1998 influenza season in the UK, cell-EIA w=
as
  compared to cell culture for the detection and typing of influenza A viru=
ses in
  NPS obtained by sentinel general practitioners in community surveillance.=
 The
  cell EIA can also be used to detect different influenza A subtypes (H3N2,=
 H1N1,
  H5N3, H5N1, H7N7, and H9N2) and was used as a rapid detection assay for t=
he
  screening of individuals returning from Hong Kong with influenza-like ill=
ness
  suspected to be due to H5N1 in 1997-98, providing a rapid, efficient,
  inexpensive method for the screening of influenza A cases during an outbr=
eak or
  pandemic situation. The cell-EIA results reflected the results obtained b=
y
  traditional virus culture within the age distribution of samples, clinica=
l
  symptoms, and time between date of illness onset and sampling of cases,
  indicating its usefulness in surveillance of human and non-human influenz=
a
  viruses. During two outbreaks of influenza in schools, Directigen flu-A, =
a near
  patient test, the cell-EIA, and tissue culture were compared. The cell-EI=
A gave
  higher sensitivity and specificity (74% and 90%) than Directigen flu-A (6=
5% and
  84.6%) in comparison with cell culture.

  Giardia lamblia (in 10%) were the most common pathogens. In the older pat=
ients,
  Campylobacter species was also the most common pathogen (8 to 15% of pati=

  In addition, several symptoms in case patients were associated with speci=
fic
  pathogens. Blood in the stool was associated with infection with Campylob=

PY: 2000
LA: English
AB: Children are the most susceptible population to lead exposure because o=
f
  three interacting factors; they have more opportunity for contact with le=
ad
  sources due to their activities, lead absorption occurs more readily in a=
 child
  compared to an adult, and the child's development is more vulnerable to l=
ead
  than adults. Low levels of lead in the blood have been shown to cause adv=
erse
  health effects; the level of concern for children is currently 10 =B5g/dl=
. The
  contribution of dietary exposure of lead to increased blood lead levels (=
PbB)
  is not well characterized. This study was conducted to measure potential
  dietary lead intakes of children 2 to 3 years of age who live in homes
  contaminated with environmental lead. Objectives were to estimate lead in=
takes
  for children consuming food in contaminated environments, recognizing
  unstructured eating patterns and to investigate if correlations exist bet=
ween
  daily dietary exposure and measured PbB. Dietary exposure was evaluated b=
y
  collecting samples that were typical of the foods the young children ate =
in
  their homes. A 24-h duplicate of all foods plus sentinel foods, i.e.,
  individual items used to represent foods contaminated during handling, we=
re
  collected from 48 children. Ten homes were revisited to obtain informatio=
n on
  the variation in daily dietary intakes. Drinking water was evaluated both=
 as
  part of the segregated beverage sample composite and by itself. Additiona=
l
  information collected included lead concentrations from hand wipes, floor
  wipes, and venous blood, and questionnaire responses from the caregiver o=
n
  activities potentially related to exposure. Activities and hygiene practi=
ces of
  the children and contamination of foods in their environment influences t=
otal
  dietary intake. Estimated mean dietary intakes of lead (29.2 =B5g Pb/day)=
 were
  more than three times the measured 24-h duplicate-diet levels (8.37 =B5g =
Pb/day),
  which were almost six times higher than current national estimates (1.4 =
=B5g
  Pb/day). Statistically significant correlations were observed between flo=
or
  wipes and foods contacting contaminated surfaces, hand wipes and foods
  contacting contaminated hands and surfaces, and hand wipes and floor wipe=
s.
  This study indicates that the dietary pathway of exposure to lead is impa=
cted
  by eating activities of children living in lead-contaminated environments=
 and
  that analysis of foods themselves is not enough to determine excess dieta=
ry
  exposures that are occurring.

  pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant S.

  sampled 430 birds, representing 18 species in four orders, during 13-23

  positive for West Nile (WN) virus-neutralizing antibodies, and 0.5% were

AB: A study was conducted to compare HIV prevalence in antenatal clinics (A=
NC)
  and the general population, and to identify factors determining the diffe=
rences
  that were found. Cross-sectional surveys were conducted during 1997-98 in=
 the
  general population and in ANC in three cities (Kisumu, Kenya; Ndola, Zamb=
ia;
  and Yaounde, Cameroon). HIV prevalence measured in adults in the communit=
y was
  compared with that measured by sentinel surveillance. In Yaounde and Ndol=
a, the
  HIV prevalence in ANC attenders was lower than that in women in the popul=
ation
  overall, and for age groups over 20 years. In Kisumu, the HIV prevalence =
in ANC
  attenders was similar to that in women in the population at all ages. The=
 only
  factors identified that influenced the results were age, marital status,
  parity, schooling, and contraceptive use. The HIV prevalence in women in =
ANC
  was similar to that in the combined male and female population aged 15-40=
 years
  in Yaounde and Ndola, but overestimated it in Kisumu. In Yaounde and Ndol=
a, the
  overall HIV prevalence in men was approximated by using the age of the fa=
ther
  of the child reported by ANC attenders, but this method overestimated the=
 HIV
  prevalence in Kisumu, and did not give good age-specific estimates. Few f=
actors
  influenced the difference in HIV prevalence between ANC and the populatio=
n,
  which could aid the development of adjustment procedures to estimate popu=
lation
  HIV prevalence. However, the differences between cities were considerable=
,
  making standard adjustments difficult. The method of estimating male HIV
  prevalence should be tested in other sites.

s to
  map resistance on a broad scale are needed. A molecular marker for chloro=
quine
  resistance, pfcrt T76, can be used for surveillance of clinical chloroqui=
ne
  resistance. The prevalence of pfcrt T76 and the prevalence of clinical
  chloroquine resistance and therapeutic failure were measured at sentinel =
sites
  and used to calculate age-adjusted genotype-resistance indices (GRIs) and
  genotype-failure indices (GFIs). Treatment outcomes were noted for 1424
  patients between 1997 and 1999. Results revealed stable GRIs and GFIs at
  different sites in Mali, West Africa. This model permits mapping of chlor=
oquine
  resistance using molecular tools in rapid and simple cross-sectional surv=
eys.

AB: Objective: The objective of this study was to explore whether the
  differences in rate of spread of HIV in different regions in sub-Saharan =
Africa
  could be explained by differences in sexual behaviour and/or factors
  influencing the probability of HIV transmission during sexual intercourse=
.
  Methods: A cross-sectional, population-based study was conducted in 1997 =
and
  1998 in two cities with a high HIV prevalence (Kisumu in Kenya and Ndola =
in
  Zambia) and two cities with a relatively low HIV prevalence (Cotonou in B=
enin
  and Yaounde in Cameroon). In each of these cities, approximately 1000 men=
 and
  1000 women, aged 15-49 years, were randomly selected from the general
  population. Consenting men and women were interviewed and were tested for=
 HIV,
  syphilis, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), gonorrhoea, chlamydial inf=
ection
  and trichomoniasis (the latter for women only). In addition, a survey was
  conducted on a random sample of 300 sex workers in each city. The researc=
h
  instruments, including the questionnaires and the laboratory procedures, =
were
  standardized to permit comparison of results. Results: The numbers of men
  interviewed were 1021 in Cotonou, 973 in Yaounde, 829 in Kisumu, and 720 =
in
  Ndola. The corresponding figures for women were 1095, 1116, 1060 and 1130=
. In
  Yaounde, Kisumu and Ndola, the response rates for men were lower than for=
 women
  due to failure to make contact with eligible men. The proportion of eligi=
ble
  women who were interviewed was 86% in Yaounde, and 89% in Kisumu and Ndol=
a. In
  Yaounde, 76% of eligible men were interviewed, along with 82% in Kisumu a=
nd 75%
  in Ndola. The prevalence of HIV infection in men was 3.3% in Cotonou, 4.1=
% in
  Yaounde, 19.8% in Kisumu and 23.2% in Ndola. For women, the respective fi=
gures
  were 3.4, 7.8, 30.1 and 31.9%. The prevalence of HIV infection among wome=
n aged
  15-19 years was 23.0% in Kisumu and 15.4% in Ndola. Among women in Kisumu=
 who
  had their sexual debut 5 years before the interview, the prevalence of HI=
V
  infection was 46%; in Ndola, it was 59%. Among sex workers, the prevalenc=
e of
  HIV infection was 57.5% in Cotonou, 34.4% in Yaounde, 74.7% in Kisumu and=
 68.7%
  in Ndola. Conclusions: The HIV prevalence rates in the general population
  confirmed our preliminary assessment of the level of HIV infection in the=
 four
  cities, which was based on estimates of HIV prevalence from sentinel
  surveillance among pregnant women. The very high prevalence of HIV infect=
ion
  among young women in Kisumu and Ndola calls for urgent intervention.

AB: Insecticide-treated bednets and curtains have been shown to be successf=
ul in
  reducing malaria transmission and child mortality in Africa over periods =
of up
  to 2 years. A major concern relating to this approach is that, in time, i=
t will
  be compromised by the selection of mosquito genotypes that are resistant =
at the
  biochemical or behavioural level. We report entomological data from a lar=
ge
  area in Burkina Faso where insecticide-treated curtains have been in use =
for up
  to 5 years. Longitudinal indoor and outdoor CDC light-trap catches were
  performed in 4 sentinel villages. In addition cross-sectional surveys usi=
ng
  indoor spray catches and outdoor CDC light-trap catches were performed ea=
ch
  September in a larger number of villages, including 8 located outside the
  intervention area. We found no evidence of the selection of mosquito phen=
otypes
  that might compromise the intervention. Indoor and outdoor vector densiti=
es
  remained very low after 5 years of intervention, both compared with pre
  -intervention levels and with concurrent levels outside the intervention =
area.
  We found no evidence of a switch to outdoor rather than indoor biting. Th=
e
  proportion of blood meals taken on humans may have decreased but our data=
 are
  inconclusive on this point. We observed higher vector densities and sporo=
zoite
  rates at the periphery of the intervention zone than at the centre, which=
 may
  reflect re-invasion of peripheral villages by mosquitoes from outside the
  intervention area. In 'real life' programmes, with perhaps patchy, less t=
han
  optimal coverage, the protection against malaria transmission provided to
  individuals using insecticide-treated materials may be less than that ach=
ieved
  in the randomized controlled trials which demonstrated an impact of insec=
ticide

AB: Objective: To estimate the prevalence of resistance-conferring mutation=
s to
  antiretroviral drugs in previously untreated patients with chronic HIV-1
  infection as a basis for French recommendations on viral genotyping befor=
e
  antiretroviral treatment initiation. Design: Resistance mutations were so=
ught
  in samples from 404 patients seen in 23 specialized centres throughout
  metropolitan France in 1998. Methods: The protease and reverse transcript=
ase
  (RT) genes of plasma virions were sequenced. Primary and secondary protea=
se and
  RT gene mutations were identified from the International AIDS Society
  resistance testing -- USA panel. Results: The prevalence of patients with
  primary and secondary mutations were 3.7% (95% CI 1.7-5.7) and 50.3% (95%=
 CI
  45.0-55.6), respectively. The prevalence of patients with mutations assoc=
iated
  with resistance to nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTI) and non-nucleoside RT
  inhibitors was 3.3% (95% CI 1.5-5.1) and 0.8% (95% CI 0.0-1.7), respectiv=
ely.
  The prevalence of patients with NRTI primary mutations differed according=
 to
  whether seropositivity had been diagnosed more or less than one year prev=
iously
  (0.2 versus 2.2% P=3D0.023). Primary mutations associated with protease i=
nhibitor
  resistance occurred at a prevalence of 1.9% (95% CI 0.5-3.4) with no diff=
erence
  according to the duration of known seropositivity. Conclusion: In France,=
 in
  1998, the prevalence of patients with primary mutations associated with
  resistance to antiretroviral drugs was low. Genotyping before the initiat=
ion of
  therapy was not recommended in chronically HIV-1-infected naive patients.=
 A
  national sentinel survey of resistance in this clinical setting is perfor=
med
  regularly to update the recommendations for resistance testing.

AB: The core Zambian system for epidemiological surveillance and research h=
as
  two major components: (i) HIV sentinel surveillance at selected antenatal
  clinics (ANC) in all provinces; and (ii) population based HIV surveys in
  selected sentinel populations (1996 and 1999). The former was refined in =
1994
  to improve the monitoring of prevalence trends, whereas the latter was de=
signed
  to validate ANC-based data, to study change in prevalence and behaviour
  concomitantly and to assess demographic impacts. Data from these surveill=
ance
  systems were used to examine trends in HIV prevalence and behaviours in Z=
ambia
  during the 1990s. The ANC-based data showed a dominant trend of significa=
nt
  declines in HIV prevalence in the 15-19 years age group and also in age g=
roup
  20-24 years in urban sites. When rates were adjusted for over-representat=
ion of
  women with low education, a similar declining trend was also observed. In=
 the
  general population, prevalence declined significantly in urban women aged=
 15-29
  years, whereas it showed a tendency to decline among rural women aged 15-=
24
  years. Prominent decline in prevalence was associated with higher educati=
on,
  stable or rising prevalence with low education. There was evidence in urb=
an
  populations of increased condom use, decline in multiple sexual partners =
and,
  among younger women, delayed age at first birth. These results suggest a
  dominant declining trend in HIV prevalence that corresponds to declines i=
n
  incidence since the early 1990s attributable to behavioural changes. Effo=
rts to
  sustain the ongoing process of change in the well-educated segments of th=
e
  population should not be undervalued, but the modest change in behaviour
  identified among the most deprived groups represents the major preventive
  challenge.

AB: A sentinel surveillance was conducted among male sexually transmitted
  disease patients, randomly selected among all new sexually transmitted di=
sease
  patients who visited the Family Planning Clinic during June 1996 to June =
1997.
  The aim of the surveillance is to determine the prevalence of human
  immunodeficiency virus infection among male patients with sexually transm=
itted
  disease in Kuwait with emphasis on the type of sexually transmitted disea=
ses
  and sexual partners. The patient data was recorded by the attending physi=
cian
  on a specially designed questionnaire. A total of 1984 subjects were scre=
ened,
  out of which not a single human immunodeficiency virus/acquired
  immunodeficiency syndrome case was found. Among the screened, 69% were no=
n
  -Kuwaitis. Most of the subjects (76%) belonged to the age group 15-34 yea=
rs,
  were married (53%), were illiterate (37.5%) and belonged to the low SES g=
roup
  (70%). The most common sexually transmitted diseases were non-specific
  urethritis (45%) and gonorrhoea (42%). With regard to sexual practices, t=
he
  majority of the respondents showed preference for female prostitutes, bot=
h
  inside (50%) and outside (48%) Kuwait. The absence of any human
  immunodeficiency virus positive case was probably due to the mandatory
  screening for granting residency in Kuwait, facilitating early detection =
of
  virus carriers among non-Kuwaitis. We, as researchers, are not sure if th=
is
  study is true representation of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired
  immunodeficiency syndrome prevalence among Kuwaiti sexually transmitted d=
isease
  patients in this country who might seek treatment in private clinics. Mor=
eover,
  the absence of prostitution as professional trade also tends to show the
  absence of indigenous circulation of the virus. Nevertheless, continuos
  surveillance is necessary to maintain and prevent the groups with risky
  behaviours from contracting the virus through sexual transmission. There =
is a
  distinct need to develop public education and awareness programmes to ser=
ve as
  measures of prevention and protection.

  Shigella accounts for the majority of dysenteric episodes, very little is=
 known
  about the epidemiology of postshigellosis persistent diarrhoea. Rural
  Bangladeshi children < 5 years of age (n=3D1756) were followed for 1 mont=
h after
  exposure to sentinel cases of Shigella dysentery. The likelihood of an ac=

  diarrhoeal episode becoming persistent was assessed. Between 1 November 1=
987
  and 30 November 1989, 507 shigellosis patients were eligible to serve as
  sentinel cases, among which the neighbourhoods of 240 were chosen. Diarrh=
oea
  caused by Shigella was significantly associated with an increased risk of
  persistent diarrhea (age-adjusted relative risk (RR), 1.83; 95% confidenc=
e
  interval (CI), 1.19-2.81). Despite the use of nalidixic acid in dysenteri=
c
  episodes, persistent diarrhoea occurred in 23% of children with shigellos=
is.
  Infection by multiple antibiotic-resistant Shigella isolates (age-adjuste=
d RR,
  3.76; 95% CI, 1.51-9.36) and occurrence of shigellosis during infancy wer=
e
  observed to be risk factors for initiation of Shigella diarrhoea persiste=

  However, 88% of the persistent shigellosis episodes occurred in older chi=
ldren,
  50% were associated with nondysenteric shigellosis and 79% were caused by
  Shigella species other than Shigella dysenteriae 1. These data demonstrat=
e the
  importance of Shigella as a cause of persistent diarrhoea and indicate th=
at
  strategies to prevent postshigellosis persistent diarrhoea must be broad-=

  with a focus on older children as well as infants, management of nondysen=

AB: To assess the molecular epidemiology of human immunodeficiency virus ty=

  (HIV-1), a screening method was developed for identification of non-B sub=
types
  from sequence data obtained for resistance testing. Blood specimens (coll=
ected
  from 1997-2000) from patients attending HIV-AIDS reference hospitals in
  Marseille, France were studied. The method is based on the evaluation of =
the
  percentage of divergence of a given sequence from the reference B subtype=
 HXB2.
  Analysis of 1720 reverse-transcriptase (RT) and 1824 protease sequences s=
tored
  in a database allowed for the determination of a threshold level of diver=
gence
  from HXB2 above which a non-B subtype could be unambiguously characterize=
d
  regardless of the pattern of resistance mutations ( > 8.6% for RT; > 10.8=
% for
  protease). This conclusion was validated by phylogenetic analysis of RT,
  protease, and env genes. Overall, 72 (4.2%) and 73 (4.0%) non-B sequences=
 were
  identified in the RT and protease coding regions, respectively. This meth=
od
  allows for the rapid detection of non-B subtypes among retrospective, rec=

AB: In Oshima, the southern part of Hokkaido, Japan, a 37-year-old woman wh=
o
  developed a sudden febrile illness was diagnosed with tick-borne encephal=
itis
  (TBE) in 1993. In addition, TBE virus was isolated from the blood samples=
 of
  sentinel dogs, ticks' pools, and rodents spleens in 1995 and 1996 by suck=
ling
  mice. To identify when these TBE viruses emerged in Hokkaido, the times o=
f
  divergence of TBE virus strains isolated in Oshima and Far Eastern Russia=
 were
  estimated. TBE virus was isolated in Khabarovsk in 1998, and the nucleoti=
de
  sequences of viral envelope protein genes of isolates from Oshima and
  Khabarovsk were compared. Based on the synonymous substitution rates of t=
hese
  virus E-protein genes, the lineage-divergence times of these TBE virus st=
rains
  were predicted phylogenetically to be approximately 260-430 years ago.
  Furthermore, the virulence of TBE virus isolates from Oshima and Khabarov=
sk
  were compared in a mouse model. The results showed that the isolates poss=
essed
  very similar virulence in mice. European TBE vaccine was found to be effe=
ctive
  in TBE virus, Hokkaido strain. This review provides evidence that the Osh=
ima
  strains of TBE virus in Hokkaido emerged from the Far Eastern Russia a fe=
w
  hundred years ago, which explains why the virulence of these strains is s=
imilar
  to that of TBE viruses isolated in Russia. Practical application of the v=
accine
  should be considered in Japan.

AB: In order to evaluate the Japanese nationwide school absenteeism surveil=

  system for paediatric influenza in comparison with the national sentinel
  surveillance for influenza, we used surveillance guidelines (Centers for
  Disease Control and Prevention, 1998) to determine the efficacy of the sc=
hool
  health surveillance system (SHSS). Data regarding school absenteeism in
  students aged 4-15 years old was compared with data regarding influenza-l=
ike
  illness (ILI) per sentinel sites during the 2nd to the 11th week of 1998 =
and
  1999. Despite the system's high simplicity and acceptability, telecommuni=
cation
  costs were estimated at US$ 490000 (1998). Representation of school child=
ren
  was very accurate, but ILI for pre-school children (4-6 years) remained
  unaccountable. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of=
 the
  SHSS compared to sentinel surveillance were calculated as 80%, 100%, and =
100%,
  respectively (P=3D0.004). Although the SHSS was found to provide accurate
  surveillance data during periods of high influenza activity, non-influenz=
a
  virus infections (e.g., adenovirus, rotavirus, and Norwalk virus, etc.) m=
ay
  become mixed in the SHSS data. Evaluation using this system should be con=
tinued
  employing a new case definition excluding gastrointestinal symptoms.

AB: A review of the information on the HIV epidemic in Ethiopia is importan=
t to
  guide policy and action. Published and unpublished reports and surveillan=
ce
  data from records of governmental and non-governmental institutions were
  examined to assess the extent of the epidemic. It appears that the HIV/AI=
DS
  epidemic has affected a large segment of the urban population. Surveillan=
ce
  data from pregnant women attending antenatal clinics indicate a decreasin=
g
  trend in the prevalence of HIV in Addis Ababa. Similarly, data from blood
  donors from the majority of transfusion centres in the country indicate a
  decrease in prevalence. However, further studies will be required to esta=
blish
  the validity of these findings. Currently available data are not adequate=
 to
  accurately measure the level of infection in rural areas where 85% of the
  population live. Outside of Addis Ababa, in places where ANC-based sentin=
el
  surveillance are operational, the systems are not fully supported by qual=
ity
  control. Thus, there are concerns regarding the validity of reported resu=
lts.
  The impact of HIV/AIDS epidemic in Ethiopia needs to be further quantifie=
d both
  in its burden of diseases and its impact on the urban and rural economy a=
nd
  society. It is, therefore, important that effort and adequate resources a=
re put
  into strengthening surveillance systems.

AB: Population HIV prevalence estimates rely heavily on sentinel surveillan=
ce in
  antenatal clinics (ANCs), but because HIV reduces fertility, these estima=
tes
  are biased. To aid interpretation of such data, we estimated HIV-associat=
ed
  fertility reduction among pregnant women attending ANCs in Yaounde (Camer=
oon),
  Kisumu (Kenya), and Ndola (Zambia) in 1998. Data collection followed exis=
ting
  HIV sentinel surveillance procedures as far as possible. Data were availa=
ble on
  about 1500 women in Yaounde and Kisumu, and on 1000 women in Ndola. HIV
  prevalence among the women was 5.5% in Yaounde, 30.6% in Kisumu, and 27.3=
% in
  Ndola. The birth interval was prolonged in HIV-positive multiparous women
  compared with HIV-negative multiparous women in all three sites: adjusted
  hazard ratios of pregnancy were 0.84 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.62-=
1.1)
  in Yaounde, 0.82 (95% CI: 0.70-0.96) in Kisumu, and 0.74 (95% CI: 0.61-0.=
90) in
  Ndola, implying estimated reductions in the risk of pregnancy in HIV-posi=
tive
  women of between 16% and 26%. For primiparous women, the interval between
  sexual debut and birth was longer in HIV-positive women than in HIV-negat=
ive
  women in all sites, although the association was lost in Ndola after adju=
sting
  for age and other factors. Consistent results in different study sites he=
lp in
  the development of standard methods for improving ANC-based surveillance
  estimates of HIV prevalence. These may be easier to devise for multiparou=
s
  women than for primiparous women.

AB: To describe epidemiological patterns and trends in HIV infection in Vie=

e
  reviewed nationwide HIV case reports, and we analysed annual seroprevalen=
ce
  among different sentinel populations in 21 provinces, using the chi2 test=
 for
  linear trend. HIV prevention efforts were also reviewed. Through 1999, 17=
046
  HIV infections, including 2947 AIDS cases and 1523 deaths had been report=
ed in
  Vietnam. The cumulative incidence rate for the country was 22.5 per 10000=
0
  population. Injection drug users (IDUs) represented 89.0% of all those fo=
r whom
  risk was reported before 1997 and 88.0% in the period 1997-99. In 1999, H=
IV
  prevalence rates among IDUs ranged by province from 0% to 89.4%. Signific=
antly
  increasing HIV trends among IDUs (P < 0.05) were found in 14 of the 21 se=
ntinel
  provinces during 1996-99. HIV prevalence among commercial sex workers (CS=
Ws)
  ranged from 0% to 13.2%, and increased significantly in 6 of 21 provinces=
. In
  1999, prevalences among pregnant women, blood donors, and military recrui=
ts
  were 0.12%, 0.20% and 0.61%, respectively. Major prevention activities in=
clude
  mass information; peer education and outreach among groups at increased r=
isk;
  availability of low-cost syringes and condoms through pharmacies; needle
  exchange pilot projects; widely available treatment for sexually transmit=
ted
  diseases; antibody screening of blood for transfusion; and free medical
  treatment at government hospitals. The HIV epidemic continues to evolve
  rapidly, intensifying among IDUs and increasing among CSWs. Serosurveilla=
nce
  indicators of HIV in the population at large continue to indicate the
  relatively slow extension beyond those at highest risk. Immediate and int=
ensive
  preventions in high-risk groups may decelerate expansion to the broader
  population.

AB: We described the epidemiological and clinical features of human Murray
  Valley encephalitis (MVE) and Kunjin (KUN) virus infections in Western
  Australia (WA) during March to July 2000. A case series was performed. Fo=
r
  laboratory-confirmed cases, travel histories and clinical details were
  collected from patients, family members, friends or treating physicians.
  Surveillance data from the sentinel chicken programme and climatic condit=
ions
  were reviewed. Nine encephalitic cases of MVE were recorded. Eight were n=
on
  -Aboriginal adults (age range, 25 to 79 years; 5 male, 3 female) and 1 wa=
s an
  Aboriginal boy. Four cases of acquired infection in the Murchison and Mid=
west
  regions of WA from which no human cases of MVE have been reported previou=
sly.
  One of the 9 cases was fatal and 3 had severe neurological sequelae. Five=
 non
  -encephalitic infections were also recorded, 3 MVE and 2 KUN. Encephaliti=
s
  caused by MVE virus remains a serious problem with no improvement in clin=
ical
  outcomes in the last 25 years. Excessive rainfall with widespread floodin=
g in
  the northern two-thirds of WA provided ideal conditions for mosquito bree=
ding
  and favoured southerly spread of the virus into new and more heavily popu=
lated
  areas. Surveillance in WA with sentinel chickens and mosquito trapping ne=
eds
  expansion to define the boundaries of MVE virus activity. To enable timel=
y
  warnings to the public, and to institute mosquito control where feasible,
  continued surveillance in all Australian areas at risk is indicated.

  compared to Golden Bear Oil (GB-1111) and a water-based Bti formulation a=
gainst
  3rd- to 4th-stage Anopheles quadrimaculatus larvae confined to sentinel c=
ages
  in small rice plots. Three replicates each of MSO with 2% Pyroter added a=
s a
  surfactant (MSO + PYR), MSO with 2% Pyroter and 4 g of Bti technical powd=
er
  (MSO + PYR + Bti), GB-1111, a water-based formulation with 4 g of Bti tec=
hnical
  powder (Bti + water), and untreated controls were performed. Mosquito lar=
vae
  were introduced on the 1st day of treatment and at 4 days posttreatment.
  Mortality was recorded at 24 and 48 h posttreatment for the 1st installat=
ion
  and at 5 days posttreatment for the 2nd installation. The Bti + water
  formulation provided 71% control and the MSO + PYR + Bti formulation achi=
eved
  64% control, whereas MSO + PYR and GB-1111 produced 16 and 18% control,
  respectively, at 24 h posttreatment. With the exception of MSO + PYR + Bt=
i,
  which decreased by 2%, the mean percent control increased slightly at 48 =
h
  posttreatment across remaining treatments, with Bti + water giving 72% co=
ntrol.
  This was significantly higher than GB-1111, which achieved 23% control at=
 48 h
  posttreatment. The MSO + PYR and MSO + PYR + Bti formulations yielded 56 =
and
  62% control, respectively, during the same interval and were not signific=
antly
  different from one another. Formulations containing MSO + PYR exhibited d=
elayed
  activity similar to GB-1111, with all formulations except MSO + PYR + Bti
  providing greatest control at 48 h posttreatment. Both MSO formulations (=
MSO +
  PYR + Bti and MSO + PYR) were statistically comparable to Bti + water and=
 GB
  -1111, respectively, at 24 and 48 h posttreatment. None of the formulatio=
ns
  exhibited a residual activity adequate enough to control A. quadrimaculat=
us
  larvae for up to 5 days.

AB: An influenza survey was conducted in seven sentinel sites in Dakar, Sen=
egal
  from June 1996 to December 1998. Throat or nasal swab cultures were rando=
mly
  collected from 804 patients suffering from influenza-like symptoms. Influ=
enza
  viruses were isolated at a similar proportion in adults and in children
  (P=3D0.29). Strains of influenza B viruses were isolated from sporadic ca=
ses in
  1997, whereas type A virus was associated with an isolated peak. Proporti=
ons of
  influenza virus isolation varied from 17.5 to 40.0% between 1996 and 1998
  during the peak period (July/September) of acute respiratory infection in
  Dakar. Rainfall, humidity, and temperatures rose during the same period.
  Influenza in Dakar seems to be an-all-age groups respiratory infection
  characterized by high transmission during the hot and rainy season. The
  antigenic similarity of the A(H3N2) and B viruses to those circulating
  elsewhere in the world at the same time was confirmed. However, the A(H1N=
1)
  strains were found to be more closely related to an Asiatic strain which =
had
  not been isolated outside Asia previously. Consequently, the strain close=
 to
  the A(H1N1)/Wuhan/371/95 strain isolated in Dakar was included in the
  composition of the 1998/1999 influenza vaccine. This reinforces the impor=
tance
  of setting up a national influenza control strategy in tropical regions.

  throughout the sampled area, up to 100 m from the point of release. The i=

  correlation between parasitism and distance from the point of release was
  statistically significant (P < 0.001) but not very strong. At one site, s=

AB: A global study was carried out in the agropastoral zone of Sideradougou
  (Burkina Faso) on risk assessment of trypanosomiasis transmission. Sentin=
el
  herds from two different farming systems were sampled and followed up dur=
ing
  two years. The monthly incidences of infections were measured and interpr=
eted
  according to the movements of herds, their practices for watering and the=
ir
  contacts with the riparian tsetse flies (Glossina tachinoides and G. palp=
alis
  gambiensis). In Nakaka, a Fulani breeders' village 4 km away from the riv=
er,
  the parasites are transmitted during the dry season at the point of perma=
nent
  watering places inside the forest gallery. In rainy season, the tsetse fl=
ies
  disperse through the savannah and infect cattle even in the village. In P=
efrou,
  a group of farmers' settlements, herds are made up mainly of draught catt=
le.
  Animals from settlements located near the hydrographic network drink in t=
he
  river and are regularly infected all the year long. The incidences are hi=
gher
  during the rainy season and the beginning of the dry season when tsetse f=
lies
  are the most abundant. On the other and, herds from the settlements far a=
way (3
  km) from the hydrographic network are watered from wells and do not frequ=
ent
  the habitats of vectors. In such an agricultural landscape, tsetse flies =
do not
  disperse even in the rainy season. Incidences in these herds are almost n=
il.
  These results prove the importance of space and temporal contacts between=
 hosts
  and vectors in the epidemiology of trypanosomiasis in West Africa.

AB: Diarrhoea is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in developing
  countries. In Egypt, researchers have traditionally been targeting diarrh=
ea
  -related mortality. This study is an attempt to portray the morbidity and=
 risk
  factors of diarrhea among children under 5 years old (under-fives) in rur=
al
  Upper Egypt. The incidence of diarrhoea in the 6 months before the study =
(May
  -September 1996) was determined among 1025 children, aged < 5 years, in 6
  sentinel sites by inverviewing mothers or caretakers. The association bet=
ween
  diarrhoea and a set of risk variables was examined using a multivariate
  logistic regression model. Variables that appeared to have a significant
  predictive power were then included in a forward wald stepwise logit anal=
ysis
  model to estimate statistical functions which best predict the diarrhoeal
  morbidity. The incidence rate of diarrhoea was found to be 3.6 episodes p=
er
  child semiannually and the point prevalence was 19.5%. The average durati=
on of
  current episodes was 4.8=B13.7 days; 33.6% of children had had diarrhoea =
> 3
  times (recurrent diarrhoea). Four variables were found to have a signific=
ant
  association with recurrent diarrhoea. The logit coefficients and their
  significance levels indicated that, in order of contribution to risk
  prediction, the variables ranked as follows: household meat consumption,
  mother's age at the time of birth of the child, child's age, and father's
  illiteracy. A total of 74.8% of overall children were correctly predicted=
 by
  these risk factors, a figure which indicates the goodness of fit of the m=
odel.
  It is concluded that the diarrhoeal morbidity is still unacceptably high =
in
  rural Upper Egypt. More interventions are needed to control for specific =
risk
  factors.

  participants interviewed between September 1996 and January 1997 in the O=

  Post-Marketing Surveillance Study sentinel site in Marion County (Indiana=

  Indiana, USA). Diet, weight, and serum lipid levels were assessed before =
the
  market release of olestra and 1 year later, after olestra-containing food=
s were
  widely available. Olestra intake at the 1-year follow-up was categorized =
as
  none, low ( > 0 to 0.4 g/day), moderate (0.4 to 2.0 g/day), and heavy ( >=
 2.0
  g/day). Participants in the heavy olestra consumption category significan=
tly
  reduced dietary intake of percentage of energy from fat (2.7 percentage p=
oints,
  P for trend, 0.003) and saturated fat (1.1 percentage points, P for trend=

54
  mmol/litre (-21 mg/dL) compared with -0.14 mmol/litre (-5 mg/dL) among ol=
estra
  nonconsumers (P for trend, 0.03). These results indicate that introductio=
n of a
  new fat substitute (olestra) in the US market was associated with healthf=

  compared to the skin snip test varied from 56% to 80% depending on the lo=

  maternal and child health programmes in the area more effective and pract=

  Four health facilities (two health centres and two hospitals) were select=

  environment characteristics were also recorded. A total of 1455 cases wer=
e
  recorded, of which 59% experienced obstetric-related complications wherea=
s 41%
  had no noticeable complication. Of those with complications, 18% had a
  caesarean section and 6% had a ventouse delivery. Cross-tabulations and
  multivariate analysis have been conducted to identify the major risk fact=
ors
  for both caesarean and vacuum deliveries in the study area. Among other t=
hings,
  the study reveals that unbooked operative deliveries are common. Most wom=

  Fifty-five influenza A viruses from 27 sentinel surveillance sites during=

  titration in the presence or absence of amantadine. While amantadine-resi=
stant
  viruses were not found in sentinel surveillance sites, a high frequency o=
f
  resistance (8/26, 30.8%) in nursing homes was observed. Resistant viruses=
 can
  occur quickly and be transmitted when used in an outbreak situation at nu=
rsing
  homes, where amantadine is used either for neurologic indications or for
  influenza treatment. Eight resistant viruses had a single amino acid chan=
ge of
  the M2 protein at residue 30 or 31. In vitro, all 11 sensitive viruses tu=
rned
  resistant after 3 or 5 passages in the presence of 2 =B5g/ml amantadine, =
and they
  showed an amino acid change at residue 27, 30, or 31. The predominant ami=
no
  acid substitution in the M2 protein of resistant viruses is Ser-31-Asp (a
  change at 31, serine to asparagine). The results indicate that a monitori=

AB: A cross-sectional study was carried out during April 1994-November 1995=
 at a
  confidential clinic for female sex workers in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire to d=
etect
  anti-HIV antibodies in cervicovaginal secretions of HIV-seronegative fema=
le sex
  workers and to evaluate whether the presence of these antibodies is assoc=
iated
  with increased sexual exposure. The participants were 342 HIV-seronegativ=
e
  female sex workers in whom a cervicovaginal lavage was collected. The mai=
n
  outcome measures were the detection of antibodies to HIV-1 in cervicovagi=
nal
  lavages using an in-house and a commercial (Seradyn Sentinel) enzyme
  immunoassay; the detection of semen in cervicovaginal lavages; and the
  assessment of epidemiological and biological markers of sexual exposure t=
o HIV.
  Cervicovaginal anti-HIV antibodies were detected in 7.3 and 29.8% of wome=
n
  using in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Seradyn Sent=
inel
  respectively. All cervicovaginal secretions found to be positive by in-ho=
use
  ELISA were also positive by Seradyn Sentinel. In a minority of women, ran=
ging
  from 2.9% by in-house ELISA to 12.3% by Seradyn Sentinel, the anti-HIV
  antibodies were present in vaginal fluids that did not contain semen. Sex=
ual
  exposure to HIV was similar in women with anti-HIV antibodies in their se=
men
  -free cervicovaginal secretions compared with women without anti-HIV anti=
bodies
  in their cervicovaginal secretions. Cervicovaginal HIV-specific antibodie=
s were
  detected in a minority of sexually exposed HIV-seronegative female sex wo=
rkers
  in Abidjan. The lack of association between increased sexual exposure to =
HIV
  and presence of cervicovaginal HIV-specific antibodies suggests that the
  production of genital HIV-specific antibodies in exposed seronegative wom=
en
  depends on the ability of individual women to mount specific mucosal immu=
nity
  to HIV antigens, the determinants of which are currently unknown.

AB: A 48-kDa polypeptide, was found in human milk and was confirmed by mass
  spectrometry and sequencing to be a soluble form of the bacterial pattern
  recognition receptor CD14 (sCD14). Milk sCD14 (m-sCD14) concentrations we=
re up
  to 20-fold higher than serum sCD14 from non-pregnant, pregnant or lactati=
ng
  women. In contrast, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein was at very =
low
  levels. Mammary epithelial cells produced 48-kDa sCD14. m-sCD14 mediated
  activation by LPS and whole bacteria of CD14 negative cells, including
  intestinal epithelial cells, resulting in release of innate immune respon=
se
  molecules. m-sCD14 was undetectable in infant formulae and commercial cow=
 milk
  samples tested, although it was present in the colostrum. These results
  indicate a sentinel role for sCD14 in human milk during bacterial coloniz=
ation
  of the gut, and suggest that m-sCD14 may be involved in modulating local =
innate
  and adaptive immune responses, thus controlling homeostasis in the neonat=

AB: We conducted a community-randomized controlled trial in Pakistan to
  determine the efficacy of indoor residual spraying with alpha-cypermethri=
n
  ('Fendona', Cyanamid, NJ, USA), applied at 25 mg/m2, to prevent Plasmodiu=
m
  falciparum and P. vivax malaria. Wettable powder (WP) and suspension
  concentrate (SC) formulations were tested against an unsprayed control in=
 an
  irrigated rice-growing area of Sheikhupura district, Punjab province. The=
 study
  area of 180 km2 was divided into nine sectors, which were assigned at ran=
dom to
  control, WP, or SC treatments in replicates of 3. Sentinel villages were
  selected from each sector for entomological and disease monitoring. Malar=
ia was
  monitored by fortnightly active case detection (ACD) and by cross-section=
al
  parasite surveys on schoolchildren. Mosquito populations were monitored b=
y
  space spraying of rooms and by cattle-landing catches. The spray campaign=
 took
  place in June 1997 and covered 96% of compounds. During the 7 months afte=
r
  spraying, the incidence of falciparum malaria was 95% lower and that of v=
ivax
  malaria 80% lower in WP-sprayed than unsprayed sectors. Similar results w=
ere
  obtained for sectors sprayed with the SC formulation. Cross-sectional sur=
veys
  gave estimates of efficacy comparable to those obtained by ACD. Anopheles
  culicifacies was 80% less abundant and A. stephensi, the predominant
  anopheline, was up to 68% less abundant in sprayed areas over the 7-month
  period. Reductions in anopheline parous rates indicated that the single-s=
pray
  treatment was effective for the entire transmission season. Sprayed surfa=
ces
  lacked odour, which contributed to the popularity of the campaign. Alpha
  -cypermethrin is a promising insecticide for the control of malaria in Pa=
kistan

LA: English
AB: Dietary exposure to the trichothecene vomitoxin (VT) causes feed refusa=
l and
  elevates IgA production in the mouse. Based on the observations that IL-6=
 can
  cause anorexia and promote IgA production and that gene expression of thi=
s
  cytokine is increased in vivo and ex vivo on VT exposure, we hypothesized=
 that
  IL-6 is an essential cytokine in VT-induced feed refusal and IgA dysregul=
ation.
  To test this hypothesis, the effects of dietary VT on feed intake, weight=
 gain,
  serum IgA levels and kidney mesangial IgA deposition in an IL-6-"knockout=
"
  mouse (B6129-IL6tmi Kopf) were compared to those in both a corresponding =
"wild
  -type" (B6129F2) and a previously characterized "sentinel" strain (B6C3F1=
) that
  possess the intact gene for this cytokine. IL-6 deficiency did not alter =
the
  capacity of VT to cause feed refusal or impair weight gain. VT-fed B6129F=
2 and
  B6C3F1 mice had significantly higher serum IgA concentrations than did th=
eir
  corresponding controls fed clean diet, whereas significant differences we=
re not
  observed between IL-6 KO mice fed VT or control diets. Kidneys taken from=
 VT
  -fed wild-type and sentinel mice had significantly increased mesangial Ig=
A
  deposition as compared to controls. While slight increases in mesangial I=
gA
  were observed in VT-fed IL-6 KO mice, mean fluorescence intensities were
  significantly less than that found in the corresponding wild-type and sen=
tinel
  strains. IL-6 KO mice appeared to be less prone to the development of
  microscopic haematuria following VT exposure than were the corresponding =
wild
  -type and sentinel strains. In total, the results suggested that IL-6-def=
icient
  mice were refractory to VT-induced dysregulation of IgA production and
  development of IgA nephropathy, whereas chronic VT-mediated nutritional e=
ffects
  related to feed intake and weight gain were unaffected.

AB: In 1996, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved olestra, a fat
  substitute, for use in snack foods. Previous studies had shown that olest=
ra
  consumption could reduce absorption of carotenoids and fat-soluble vitami=
ns. To
  determine the association between consumption of olestra-containing snack=
 foods
  and serum concentrations of carotenoids and fat-soluble vitamins in a fre=

tional
  samples of 1043 adults before olestra was available and 933 adults 9 mont=
hs
  after olestra snacks were introduced into the marketplace in Marion Count=

  USA the first major test market for olestra. A cohort composed of 403 adu=
lts
  from the first survey, oversampling those most frequently reporting olest=
ra
  consumption during follow-up telephone interviews, completed a second sur=
vey.
  We assessed diet, lifestyle factors and olestra consumption, and collecte=
d
  blood for assays for the serum concentrations of six carotenoids, four fa=
t
  -soluble vitamins and lipids. Nine months after the introduction of olest=
ra
  into the marketplace, 15.5% of Marion County residents reported consuming=
 an
  olestra-containing snack in the previous month, with a median frequency a=
mong
  consumers of 3.0 times per month. There were no significant associations =
or
  consistent trends for decreased serum carotenoids or fat-soluble vitamins
  associated with olestra consumption, although cohort members consuming _2=
 g/d
  of olestra had adjusted total serum carotenoids 15% lower compared with
  baseline. There were increases in serum vitamin K concentrations associat=
ed
  with olestra consumption (P=3D0.03 in the cross section and P=3D0.06 in t=

  cohort). In summary, there was no statistically significant evidence in t=

  free-living population of associations between olestra consumption and
  decreased serum concentrations of carotenoids and fat-soluble vitamins.

AB: In the Kagera region of Tanzania, a population-based study was initiate=
d in
  1987 followed by the establishment of antenatal-clinic-based sentinel
  surveillance system in the town of Bukoba in 1990. Repeat studies in both
  populations in Bukoba in 1993 and 1996 made it possible to study the dyna=
mics
  of HIV infection prevalence and incidence in the area. This study aims at
  comparing the findings from this sentinel surveillance system with those =
of
  cross-sectional studies in the general population to assess its validity =
in
  estimating HIV prevalence and their trends in the general population. A
  multistage cluster sampling technique was used in the population-based st=
udies
  whereas the antenatal-clinic-based population was obtained by consecutive=
ly
  recruiting antenatal care attenders coming for the first time during a gi=
ven
  pregnancy. Antibodies against HIV infection were tested using 2 independe=
nt
  ELISA antibody detection tests. Unlinked anonymous testing strategy was a=
dopted
  for the sentinel population. Age-adjusted prevalence among antenatal care
  attenders decreased from 22.4% (95% confidence interval (CI), 20.6-25.2) =
in
  1990 to 16.1% (95% CI, 15.9-18.8) in 1993 and further to 13.7% (95% CI, 1=
1.8
  -14.3) in 1996. These results closely resemble those of the general popul=
ation
  of adult women in the clinic's catchment area (the town of Bukoba) where =
the
  age-adjusted prevalence of 29.1% (95% CI, 24.4-34.6) in 1987 showed a dec=
rease
  in the studies in 1993 18.7% (95% CI, 15.1-23.0) and in 1996 14.9% (95% C=
I,
  12.0-17.1). The study indicates that general population trend estimates c=
an be
  generated using sentinel surveillance data based on pregnant women visiti=
ng an
  antenatal clinic for the first time during a given pregnancy. The benefit=
s of
  using this group outweigh its limitations that are brought about by possi=
ble
  selection bias. Continued surveillance of the epidemic based on antenatal=
 care
  patients as a sentinel population is therefore recommended.

  total number of patient visits and the number of cases of influenza-like
  illness (ILI), and (c) approximately 70 World Health Organization (WHO)
  collaborating laboratories in the United States on weekly influenza virus
  isolations. WHO collaborating laboratories also submitted influenza isola=
tes to
  CDC for antigenic analysis. Throughout the year, vital statistics offices=
 in
  121 cities reported deaths related to pneumonia and influenza (P&I) weekl=
y,
  providing a measure of the impact of influenza on mortality. During the 1=
994-95
  influenza season, 25 state epidemiologists reported regional or widesprea=
d
  activity at the peak of the season. Cases of ILI reported by sentinel
  physicians exceeded baseline levels for 4 weeks, peaking at 5%. Influenza
  A(H3N2) was the most frequently isolated influenza virus type/subtype. Th=
e
  longest period of sustained excess mortality was 5 consecutive weeks, whe=
n the
  percentage of deaths attributed to P&I exceeded the epidemic threshold, p=
eaking
  at 7.6%. During the 1995-96 season, 33 state epidemiologists reported reg=

  or widespread activity at the peak of the season. ILI cases exceeded base=
line
  levels for 5 weeks, peaking at 7%. Influenza A(H1N1) viruses predominated=
,
  although influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B viruses also were identified
  throughout the United States. P&I mortality exceeded the epidemic thresho=
ld for
  6 consecutive weeks, peaking at 8.2%. The 1996-97 season was the most sev=
ere of
  the three seasons summarized in this report. Thirty-nine state epidemiolo=
gists
  reported regional or widespread activity at the peak of the season. ILI r=
eports
  exceeded baseline levels for 5 consecutive weeks, peaking at 7%. The prop=
ortion
  of respiratory specimens positive for influenza peaked at 34%, with influ=
enza
  A(H3N2) viruses predominating. Influenza B viruses were identified throug=
hout
  the United States, but only one influenza A(H1N1) virus isolate was repor=
ted
  overall. The proportion of deaths attributed to P&I exceeded the epidemic
  threshold for 10 consecutive weeks, peaking at 9.1%. Influenza A(H1N1),
  A(H3N2), and B viruses circulated during 1994-1997. Local surveillance da=
ta are
  important because of geographic and temporal differences in the circulati=
on of
  influenza types/subtypes. CDC conducts active national surveillance annua=
lly
  from October through May for influenza to detect the emergence and spread=
 of
  influenza virus variants and monitor the impact of influenza-related morb=
idity
  and mortality. Surveillance data are provided weekly throughout the influ=
enza
  season to public health officials, WHO, and health-care providers and can=
 be
  used to guide prevention and control activities, vaccine strain selection=
, and
  patient care.

AB: The bi-annual HIV serosurveillance among sentinel population in all

This
  report summarizes results from the most recent 1999 annual survey. The se=
ntinel
  population with a sample size of 100-200 per group per province were sele=
cted
  and tested as previous round. Commercial sex workers (CSWs) were classifi=
ed as
  direct (from brothel based) and indirect (other sex establishments). Volu=
ntary
  confidential testing of all available CSWs from randomly selected brothel=
s and
  other kind of sex establishments was conducted. Male CSWs who provided se=
x
  services with male clients from 3 tourist, sentinel cities were tested in=
 the
  same manner as female CSWs. Male attendees at government sexually transmi=
tted
  diseases clinics (STDs) during the survey period were tested using unlink=
ed
  anonymous strategies. Pregnant women attending government ante-natal care
  clinics during the survey period were mainly tested by routine HIV testin=
g with
  a small proportion of unlinked anonymous methods in some clinics. All inj=
ecting
  drug users in major drug treatment clinics during the survey period were
  enrolled and tested on a voluntary confidential process. Data from HIV
  screening of donated blood for the whole month were retrieved and analyse=
d. The
  median, maximum and minimum prevalence of each sentinel group from all se=
ntinel
  sites which had sample size more than 20 were calculated to show the nati=
onal
  trend. National HIV prevalence among direct and indirect CSWs were 16.7% =
and
  6.6%, respectively, which had decreased slightly compared with last year'=
s
  figures. Male sex workers from three tourist provinces showed a median
  prevalence of 10%. HIV prevalence in donated blood was 0.44% and among
  injecting drug users was 51%, which showed a slightly increased rate.
  Prevalence among male attendees of STDs was 8.3%, showing no further decr=
ease
  from last year. Prevalence among pregnant women was 1.76% and donated blo=
od
  (0.44%) were higher than the previous year. HIV prevalence among 21-year-=
old
  male conscripts was 1.6% and still showing a declining trend. It is concl=
uded
  that although the HIV prevalence among male conscripts found by the Royal=
 Thai
  Army showed a declining trend, the country may face a re-emergence of HIV=
 among
  the general population as seen in the higher prevalence among pregnant wo=
men
  and donated blood. The authors propose a working cut-off point using a
  prevalence of 15% among CSWs, 1% in pregnant women and 30% in drug users =
to
  classify a high priority area. There are a need for these areas to review=
 the
  current situation and intervention, and propose solutions. Additional res=
ources
  and technical support should be given to these priority area.

AB: Chiang Rai province, Thailand, has experienced a severe epidemic of HIV
  infection after the first case was reported in 1988. This article utilize=
s
  available data to describe the first decade of the HIV epidemic in Chiang=
 Rai
  including the public health response, the epidemiology of related infecti=
ons,
  and the effects of the epidemic. Although prevalence in some sentinel
  surveillance populations is decreasing, there will continue to create
  substantial HIV-related morbidity and mortality and social effects for ye=
ars to
  come. Demographic characteristics of the epidemic in some groups have cha=
nged
  as a result of public health interventions. Responsible authorities used
  surveillance and research results to understand risk behaviours and devel=
op
  effective interventions targeting the appropriate populations. Strong sup=
port
  from policy makers, including resource allocation, was a critical element=
 in
  the success of the prevention programme and such support is still a neces=
sity.
  Continuing epidemiological research is needed to describe the effective T=
hai
  heterosexual transmission prevention programme and to guide development o=
f
  effective interventions in other risk groups.

AB: The authors searched for perihepatic lymph nodes during ultrasonography
  performed for other symptoms in 1222 Sicilian outpatients between January=
 1994
  and May 1998 in order to assess the incidence and possible significance o=
f the
  association of perihepatic lymph nodes and chronic hepatitis C. One or 2 =
lymph
  nodes were observed in 184/1222 patients, and 142 of these 184 were anti
  -hepatitis C virus (HCV) positive. Our results confirmed a very high inci=
dence
  of perihepatic lymphadenopathy during chronic hepatitis. The concomitant
  presence of HCV virus and perihepatic lymph nodes may confirm the marked
  lymphotropism of this virus. As anti-HCV positivity is frequent in asympt=
omatic
  subjects with normal alanine aminotransferase concentrations, the authors
  believe that searching for sentinel perihepatic lymph nodes during abdomi=
nal
  ultrasonography could be recommended in routine diagnostic screening for =
HCV
  infection. Any perihepatic lymph nodes detected by this method could pinp=
oint
  subjects for whom more specific examinations are required, especially in =
areas
  where the virus is particularly endemic.

AB: Sewage treatments are not efficient to eliminate enteric microorganisms=
.
  Viruses are able to persist and are discharged into the marine environmen=
t with
  treated effluents. Few data are now available on the magnitude and the
  contributive processes of marine viral contamination. This work evaluates=
 the
  relationship between the magnitude of rainfall and the viral contaminatio=
n of
  the marine environment during winter epidemics of gastroenteritis in huma=
n
  coastal populations. A RT-PCR method was used to detect enterovirus, hepa=
titis
  A virus, Norwalk-like virus, astrovirus and rotavirus in shellfish, harve=
sted
  monthly between August 1995 and July 1998. The frequency of virus detecti=
on in
  shellfish was expressed as an Index of Viral Contamination. Acute
  gastroenteritis in the population was estimated using the French Sentinel
  System for Monitoring of Communicable Diseases. Rainfall effects on the
  efficiency of sewage treatment were assessed using an estimated staying t=
ime of
  sewage effluents in the plant. The results indicate that the highest vira=
l
  contamination occurs in winter. Maximal indexes of viral contamination we=
re
  respectively 70% in January 1996, 100% in January 1997, but only 31% in J=
anuary
  1998. Viral contamination variations seemed to follow the pattern of the =
winter
  epidemic of acute gastroenteritis in the local population in 1996 and 199=
7.
  These observations should be linked to the winter rainfalls. Heavy rains =
on
  short periods of time could create an hydraulic overload in the sewage
  treatment plant, reducing the staying time of the sewage effluents and th=
us the
  efficiency of the disinfection process. The magnitude of the viral
  contamination of shellfish seems to result from the simultaneity between =
the
  winter epidemics of acute gastroenteritis in the coastal population and h=
eavy
  rainfall. To prevent public health hazards associated with shellfish
  consumption, the monitoring of microbiological quality in shellfish harve=
sting
  areas should include accompanying survey of viral epidemic in the coastal
  population, and of sewage outputs in the coastal environment.

a,
  antimicrobials and animal species have been defined for each of these gro=

  data analysis and reporting. Surveillance of sick animals was first imple=

  using Escherichia coli as the sentinel bacterium. Surveillance of E. coli=
 and
  Enterococcus faecium from healthy pigs was implemented in 1998. In July 1=
999,
  data collection on Salmonella spp. was initiated in poultry slaughterhous=

 that
  focal transmission of malaria in the districts bordering both Niles has b=

AB: Biochemical measures of nutrients or other dietary constituents can be =
an
  important component of nutritional assessment and monitoring. However, ac=
curate
  interpretation of the nutrient concentration is dependent on knowledge of=
 the
  determinants of the body pool measured. The purpose of this study was to
  identify the determinants of serum carotenoid and fat-soluble vitamin
  concentrations in a large, community-based sample (n=3D1042). Multiple li=
near
  regression analysis was used to examine effects of demographic characteri=
stics
  (age, sex, race/ethnicity, education), health-related behavior (exercise,=
 sun
  exposure, smoking, alcohol consumption), and intake (diet, supplements) o=
n
  serum retinol, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, alpha-tocopherol, phylloquinone, and
  carotenoid concentrations. Age, sex, race/ethnicity, vitamin A intake, an=
d
  alcohol consumption were found to be determinants of serum retinol
  concentration. Race/ethnicity, vitamin D intake, body mass index, smoking
  status, and sun exposure were determinants of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D
  concentration. Determinants of serum alpha-tocopherol were age, sex,
  race/ethnicity, alpha-tocopherol intake, serum cholesterol, percentage of
  energy from fat (inversely related), supplement use, and body mass index.=
 Age,
  sex, phylloquinone intake, serum triglycerides, and supplement use were
  determinants of serum phylloquinone concentration. Primary determinants o=
f
  serum carotenoids were age, sex, race/ethnicity, carotenoid intake, serum
  cholesterol, alcohol consumption, body mass index, and smoking status. Ov=
erall,
  the demographic, dietary, and other lifestyle factors explained little of=
 the
  variability in serum concentrations of retinol (R2=3D0.20), 25-hydroxyvit=
amin D
  (R2=3D0.24), and the carotenoids (R2=3D0.15-0.26); only modest amounts of=
 the
  variability in serum phylloquinone concentration (R2=3D0.40); and more
  substantial amounts of the variability in serum alpha-tocopherol concentr=
ation
  (R2=3D0.62).

AB: In the developing world, condom use among sex workers and their clients
  plays a dominant role in the transmission of HIV/STD. In Surabaya, Indone=
sia,
  data from the 1993 STD prevalence survey in female sex workers (brothels,
  street, massage parlours, barber shops, call-girl houses, and nightclubs)
  reveal that only 5% (33/692) of the brothel workers and 14% (25/177) of t=
he
  street walkers had condoms in their possession at the time of the intervi=
ew.
  During the last paid sexual intercourse, sex workers from the brothels,
  streets, and nightclubs used condoms infrequently (14%, 20%, and 25%,
  respectively). Sex workers from massage parlours, barber shops, and call =
girls
  were about 5 to 3 times more likely to use condoms than sex workers from
  nightclubs (adjusted odds ratio of 3.5, 4.9, and 4.2, respectively); thus
  condom promotion programmes should be targeted at sex workers at brothels=
,
  streets, and nightclubs. Programmes should include: (1) free distribution=
 of
  condoms to sex establishments at the initial stage, and condom social mar=
keting
  at later stages; (2) penalties, including legal sanctions, against any se=
x
  establishments that do not consistently use condoms; (3) participation of
  brothel owners and madams in encouraging sex workers to consistently have
  clients use condoms during sexual intercourse; and (4) establishment of
  sentinel surveillance to monitor STD/HIV and condom-use compliance.

AB: The first imported AIDS patient was reported in Thailand in 1984. The
  response from the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) at the very beginning =
was to
  draft AIDS definition guidelines and issue a ministerial announcement to =
add
  AIDS to the list of serious notification diseases, requiring all health
  settings in the country to report possible AIDS cases to the Ministry. As=
 a
  result, during the first six years 43 AIDS cases and 145 ARC patients wer=
e
  reported. Shortly after the first generation of HIV antibody testing was
  approved by the USFDA, investigators in Thailand started to conduct a
  prevalence survey of HIV among several high risk populations but found fe=
w HIV
  -infected individuals. An explosive outbreak was detected the first half =
of
  1988 among IDUs, increasing from 1% early of that year to 32%-43% by Sept=
ember
  of the same year. In early 1989 the MOPH initiated a more efficient effor=
t of
  monitoring the HIV infection by introducing the sentinel surveillance in =
14
  large cities which later was expanded to the entire country. This measure=
 had
  much impact on the policy makers in better understanding the situation. I=
n
  addition to this, surveillance is done annually of other important
  epidemiological data on HIV-transmission in Thailand, HIV antibody testin=
g
  among military conscripts and anonymous testing in pregnant women. Intens=
ive
  education, not only for high risk groups, but also for the general public=
, and
  studies on epidemiology, behaviour, psychosocial aspects and other underl=
ying
  factors have been carried out by various groups of researchers. Transmiss=
ion of
  HIV infection is still increasing, so additional measures (i.e., preventi=
ve
  vaccine) are gaining due attention. Cohort development for HIV vaccine
  candidates has also been started. A WHO Collaboration network for HIV vir=
us
  isolation and subtype determination has been established. Programmatic
  approaches on prevention and control have been jointly undertaken by
  governmental and nongovernmental organizations as well as international f=
unding
  agencies.

  Netherlands, and some centres in France, Spain, and Poland. The susceptib=
ility
  of Klebsiella spp. to the newer generations of cephalosporins was 82-95% =
and to

am
  antibiotic was poor, except for the carbapenems (100% susceptibility) and
  cefepime (90% susceptibility), while the susceptibility to aminoglycoside=

AB: Pregnant women can be considered a sentinel population, because they ar=
e a
  relatively unselected population whose prevalence data may be extended to=
 the
  general population. A seroepidemiological study was carried out in Padua =
(North
  -East Italy) to assess the epidemiological aspects of HCV, HBV and HIV
  infection in 2059 pregnant women consecutively seen at the Department of
  Obstetrics and Gynaecology during 1996. 1804 of 2059 (87.2%) were indigen=
ous
  and 255 (12.8%) immigrants. Sociodemographic and sanitary data were colle=
cted
  for each woman. The overall prevalence of anti-HCV was 1.9% (42.5% with
  detectable HCV-RNA); HBsAg was found in 1.0%; the prevalence of anti-HIV =
was
  0.3%. Findings are substantially consistent with the epidemiological pict=
ure of
  such infections in the general population of our geographic area. A paren=
teral
  risk factor for HCV infection was found in 19 subjects (47.5%): 18 were
  intravenous drug users and 1 was a blood transfusion recipient. HBsAg
  seroprevalence was higher in immigrants than in autochthonous (3.1% vs. 0=
.7%
  respectively, p<0.01). One of the 6 anti-HIV positive women was an intrav=
enous
  drug user. Logistic regression analysis was carried out for each viral ag=
ent to
  determine which characteristics were independently associated with infect=
ion:
  anti-HCV prevalence resulted independently associated to Italian origin (=
OR:
  3.7), unmarried status (OR: 2.7), unemployed condition (OR: 6.1) and hist=
ory of
  previous abortion (OR: 2.8). HBsAg prevalence was independently associate=
d to
  unemployed condition (OR: 10.8), whereas HIV positivity was significantly
  related to the unmarried status (OR: 18.5). It is concluded that there is=
 need
  for screening all pregnant women for HCV and HIV infection, in addition t=
o the
  HBsAg screening which is compulsory in Italy.

AB: Environmental epidemiology is the specialized aspect of public health
  science that studies human health risk from environmental hazards. It ris=
es
  largely upon a foundation of public health surveillance, and relies heavi=
ly
  upon analyses of data for small areas and sparse population groups. To a
  degree, environmental epidemiology is assigned the role of discerning ver=
y
  subtle human health impacts, or discerning early evidence of a tragic seq=
uence.
  In that context, environmental epidemiology has a substantial public educ=
ation
  and risk communication role. Environmental epidemiology will be greatly
  advanced as effective biological markers of exposure and precursor health
  effects are developed. At this point in time, statistical methods are in =
place
  to monitor population-level disease rates in high-risk populations for ea=
rly
  risk identification and sentinel event recognition. Advances in geographi=
c
  methods have provided a boon to the discipline by advantaging spatial stu=
dies.
  These advances in the discipline still need further refinement and pilot
  experiences. The inclusion of environmental epidemiological consideration=
s with
  instances of proposed industrial expansion, hazardous waste management, a=
nd
  contamination remediation is heartily recommended.

AB: Trends in HIV seroprevalence among sentinel populations of patients wit=
h new
  sexually transmitted disease episodes were monitored in 17 networks of 15
  European countries during June 1990-December 1996. Time trends were estim=
ated
  by logistic regression for homo-/bisexual men, injecting drug users (IDU)=
 and
  non-IDU heterosexuals. The networks were included as independent variable=
s to
  account for different prevalence levels across Europe. Socio-demographic =
and
  behavioural data were also included in the model. The interactions of tim=
e and
  each factor in the model were evaluated to determine whether trends diffe=
red
  across networks or population subgroups. Overall, more than 150 000 sexua=
lly
  transmitted disease episodes were registered in this study. In the Europe=
an
  network as a whole, the prevalence decreased significantly among IDU [n=
=3D2619;
  odds ratio (OR) for annual change, 0.86; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.=
80
  -0.93]. It also decreased among homo-/bisexual men (n=3D11 809; OR, 0.92;=
 95% CI,
  0.89-0.94). In both groups, trends did not differ statistically between
  networks. Among non-IDU heterosexuals (n=3D114 024) the prevalence increa=
sed
  significantly (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.04-1.13), especially among women (OR, =
1.13)
  and the time trends differed statistically across networks. A significant
  increase was observed in four networks, whereas no specific change was de=
tected
  in the others. It is concluded that by applying a standardized protocol, =
trends
  in HIV prevalence could be compared across networks and estimated at a mo=
re
  global level. For the validity of HIV trends in such surveys, it is essen=
tial
  to minimize the number of patients not being tested in networks where vol=
untary
  testing is required.

AB: A letter in response to a claim made by the Minister of Health in South
  Africa regarding the 1999 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) surveillance
  results is presented. The results of the 1999 survey established by the
  Department of Health in South Africa, wherein samples of blood routinely
  collected during antenatal visits in the public sector were tested for HI=
V on
  annual basis, are discussed. Overall prevalence has not changed (22.8% in=
 1998
  and 22.4% in 1999). A significant drop in prevalence was observed in the =
under
  -20s (21.4%) and the 20-24-year age group (1.9%), and an apparent stabili=
zation
  of the prevalence rate in the 25-29-year age group (1.9%) between 1998 an=
d 1999
  compared to an increased prevalence between 1997 and 1998 in these 3 age =
groups
  (65.4%, 32.5% and 47.8%, respectively). Such variation from year to year =
is
  difficult to explain when about 80% of women do not change age group from=
 one
  year to the next. Comparison of the survey results with those estimated u=
sing
  the Actuarial Society of South Africa's model of the demographic impact o=
f the
  heterosexual AIDS epidemic, in particular by age group, suggests that a
  plausible explanation may lie in the quality of the survey results rather=
 than
  the stabilization of the epidemic. It is encouraged that the Department o=
f
  Health should make the raw data available to bone fide researchers to ass=
ist
  with developing an in-depth understanding of the epidemic.

AB: In 1995, Nasonia vitripennis, a commercially available pupal parasitoid=
 of
  Musca domestica and Stomoxys calcitrans, was purchased to examine the sta=
tus of
  wasps being sold to Manitoba, Canada, producers. Percentage of pupae
  parasitized, numbers of parasitoids per pupa, total parasitoids, and para=
sitoid
  sex ratio were determined for each shipment of parasitoids received. To
  determine the extent to which these wasps could successfully parasitize h=
ouse
  flies and stable flies, parasitoids were released weekly in four Manitoba=
 dairy
  barns and levels of parasitism estimated. In 10 622 freeze-killed sentine=
l
  house fly pupae, 2.2% were parasitized throughout the season by N. vitrip=
ennis,
  and 5.8% were parasitized by 8 other species of parasitoids. Of 11 897
  naturally occurring house fly and stable fly pupae, 0.6% were parasitized=
 by N.
  vitripennis, and 3.4% by 8 other species of parasitoids. In 4 barns where=
 there
  were no releases of N. vitripennis, 1.1% of 11 779 sentinel pupae were
  parasitized by 4 species of parasitoids and 3.8% of 8384 naturally occurr=
ing
  house fly and stable fly pupae were parasitized by 9 species. The release=
 of an
  estimated 3 648 093 N. vitripennis did not result in substantial parasiti=
sm in
  either sentinel pupae or naturally occurring pupae. In 1996, live sentine=
l
  house fly pupae (n =3D 50 842) and house fly and stable fly pupae occurri=
ng
  naturally (n =3D 4691) were collected in two of the nonrelease barns from=
 the
  1995 study to examine the activity of endemic parasitoids. Of the sentine=
l and
  naturally occurring pupae sampled, 4.0% and 9.4% were parasitized,
  respectively. Phygadeuon fumator was the most abundant parasitoid, accoun=
ting
  for 97.4% and 79.9% of parasitoids collected from sentinel pupae and natu=
rally
  occurring pupae, respectively. Other parasitoids included Urolepis rufipe=
s,
  Muscidifurax raptor, Muscidifurax zaraptor, Spalangia subpunctata, Spalan=

AB: It has been previously reported that tickborne encephalitis (TBE) is en=
demic
  in a specific area of Hokkaido, Japan. In Oshima, the southern part of
  Hokkaido, TBE virus was isolated from sentinel dogs, ticks (Ixodes persul=
catus
  and Haemaphysalis concinna) and rodents (Apodemus speciosus and Clethrion=
omys
  rufocanus) in 1995 and 1996. To identify when these TBE viruses emerged i=
n
  Hokkaido, the times of divergence of TBE virus strains isolated in Oshima=
 and
  far-eastern Russia were estimated. TBE virus was isolated in Khabarovsk i=
n 1998
  and the nucleotide sequences of viral envelope protein genes of isolates =
from
  Oshima and Khabarovsk were compared. From the synonymous substitution rat=
e of
  these virus strains, the lineage divergence time of these TBE virus strai=
ns was
  predicted phylogenetically to be about 260-430 years ago. Furthermore, th=
e
  virulence of TBE virus isolates from Oshima and Khabarovsk were compared =
in a
  mouse model. The results showed that the isolates possessed very similar
  virulence in mice. This report provides evidence that the Oshima strains =
of TBE
  virus in Hokkaido emerged from far-eastern Russia a few hundred years ago=
 and
  this explains why these strains possess virulence similar to the TBE viru=
ses
  isolated in Russia. The EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ accession numbers for the new
  nucleotide sequences are AB001026, AB022290-AB022297 and AB022703.

  L. deliense attached to sentinel R. rattus, of which 314 larvae successfu=

  fed to repletion and were recovered, and 2 (0.6%) of these were naturally
  infected with O. tsutsugamushi. The occurrence of L. deliense was influen=

  rainfall, with more chiggers attached to rodents in the wetter months of =
the
  year. The study showed that the risk of exposure to infection with O.
  tsutsugamushi is greater during the wetter months of the year, and that o=

AB: Besides humans, many animals can be infected by the tick-borne encephal=
itis
  virus (TBEV), with or without developing clinical signs, and thus they ma=
y
  serve as indicators for TBE endemicity. Game animals like deer, wild boar=
, and
  foxes are usually heavily infested with ticks. In contrast to other anima=
ls,
  foxes are known to live in habitats with only a small radius (about 7 to =
10 km,
  rarely up to 50 km). In this way, a fox normally represents the place whe=
re it
  is found, and the local rate of anti-TBEV-seropositive foxes may indicate=
 the
  TBE endemicity in that very region. In order to investigate various geogr=
aphic
  regions in view of the possible occurrence of TBE, sera of foxes in diffe=
rent
  areas were collected and tested for antibodies against TBEV by ELISA. Six
  regions with different TBE incidences were studied: southwestern Germany =
(n=3D79
  foxes, seroprevalence 34.2%), eastern Black Forest Area (n=3D153 foxes,
  seroprevalence 9.8%), Odenwald (n=3D50 foxes, seroprevalence 10.0%), Taun=
us (n=3D50
  foxes, seroprevalence 2.0%), Brandenburg (n=3D86 foxes, seroprevalence 0%=
),
  northeastern France (n=3D55 foxes, seroprevalence 1.8%). The comparative
  descriptive analysis showed that the anti-TBEV seroprevalence in foxes
  reflected well the TBE incidences in different regions. Thus, foxes may b=
e used
  to screen for TBE endemicity in various geographic areas. As in many dist=
ricts
  fox sera are collected for rabies control, longitudinal investigations on=
 TBE
  endemicity may be based on those samples. Additionally, species which are
  easier to access (e.g. cows or goats) may be used as a sentinel system in=
 areas
  with pastures and grazing flocks.

  mosquito larvae in mangrove swamps on Sanibel Island, Florida, USA, in Ma=
y
  1997. Three sites per treatment and 3 untreated sites were used. Temephos
  (Abate) was applied at 37 ml/ha (43% active ingredient [AI]), B.t.i. gran=
ules
  (Vectobac G) were applied at 5.606 kg/ha (200 International Toxic Units/m=
g),
  and methoprene (Altosid ALL) was applied at 213 ml/ha (5% AI). Efficacy w=
as
  quantified by monitoring the survival of caged and uncaged larval Aedes
  taeniorhynchus. We quantified mortality of sentinel nontarget amphipods
  (Talitridae) at all sites, monitored the effect of temephos on flying
  arthropods using light traps, and collected dead insects in traps suspend=
ed
  under mangroves in areas treated with either temephos or methoprene. Each
  pesticide showed good overall efficacy but occasional failures occurred. =
No
  detectable mortality of amphipods or flying insects attributable to pesti=
cides
  was found. The inconsistent field efficacies of the pesticides indicate a=
 need
  for reinspection of treated sites in this habitat.

AB: A small-volume sentinel chamber was developed to assess the effects of
  environmental stresses on survival of sucrose-Percoll-purified Cryptospor=
idium
  parvum oocysts in soil and animal wastes. Chambers were tested for their
  ability to equilibrate with external chemical and moisture conditions. Se=
ntinel
  oocysts were then exposed to stresses of the external environment that af=
fected
  their viability (potential infectivity), as indicated by results of a dye
  permeability assay. Preliminary laboratory experiments indicated that
  temperatures between 35 and 50=B0C and decreases in soil water potential =
(-0.003
  to -3.20 MPa) increased oocyst inactivation rates. The effects of 2 commo=
n
  animal waste management practices on oocyst survival were investigated on=
 3
  dairy farms in New York State, USA: (i) piling wastes from dairy youngsto=
ck
  (including neonatal calves) and (ii) spreading wastes as a soil amendment=
 on an
  agricultural field. Sentinel containers filled with air-dried and sieved =
(2-mm
  mesh) youngstock waste or field soil were wetted and inoculated with 2 mi=
llion
  oocysts in an aqueous suspension and then placed in waste piles on 2 diff=
erent
  farms and in soil within a cropped field on one farm. Controls consisted =
of
  purified oocysts in either phosphate-buffered saline or distilled water
  contained in sealed microcentrifuge tubes. Two microdata loggers recorded=
 the
  ambient temperature at each field site. Sentinel experiments were conduct=
ed
  during the fall and winter (1996 to 1997) and winter (1998). Sentinel
  containers and controls were removed at 2- to 4-week intervals and oocyst=
s were
  extracted and tested by the dye permeability assay. The proportions of
  potentially infective oocysts exposed to the soil and waste pile material
  decreased more rapidly than their counterpart controls exposed to buffer =
or
  water, indicating that factors other than temperature affected oocyst
  inactivation in the waste piles and soil. The effect of soil freeze-thaw =
cycles
  was evident in the large proportion of empty sentinel oocysts. The potent=
ially
  infective sentinel oocysts were reduced to <1% while the proportions in
  controls did not decrease below 50% during the first field experiment.
  Microscopic observations of empty oocyst fragments indicated that abrasiv=
e
  effects of soil particles were a factor in oocyst inactivation.

AB: Substantial biologic and epidemiologic data indicate the importance of
  syphilis as a potential cofactor for sexual transmission of HIV infection=
, but
  few detailed data exist on the geographic covariation of these two import=
ant
  sexually transmitted infections. HIV prevalence in childbearing women and
  primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis data from 29 states were examined to
  explore the importance of the epidemiology of syphilis as a factor in
  facilitating HIV transmission. The spatial relationship between P&S syphi=
lis
  and HIV infection in the health districts of 29 states was analysed and
  adjusted for demographic and socioeconomic factors such as racial composi=
tion,
  income, housing, education levels, and access to medical services using t=
he
  1990 US census, and geographic location. In 29 states and the District of
  Columbia, 448 health districts, representing more than 75% of the US
  population, reported HIV prevalence rates for mothers' district of reside=
nce.
  The HIV seroprevalence ranged from 0 to 1258/10 000 in these health distr=
icts.
  The incidence of P&S syphilis during 1984-94 in these districts ranged fr=
om 0
  to 87/100 000. The P&S syphilis incidence was positively associated with =
the
  prevalence of HIV infection among childbearing women (P<0.0001). It is
  concluded that syphilis that persists in communities in the USA appears t=
o
  represent a 'sentinel public health event' reflecting risk for sexual HIV
  transmission. These findings, along with other biologic and epidemiologic
  information, reinforce the importance of syphilis as an indicator for tar=
geting
  HIV prevention efforts generally, as well as syphilis control as a specif=

AB: To assess the impact of water sanitation and sewage disposal, part of a
  major environmental control programme in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, seroprev=
alence
  studies for hepatitis A virus (HAV) were conducted in 3 micro-regions in =
Rio de
  Janeiro during August-November 1996. Each region varied with regard to le=
vel of
  sanitation. The discriminating power of age-specific prevalence curves fo=
r HAV
  were assessed as a proxy for improvement in sanitation. These curves will=
 serve
  as baseline information to future planned surveys as the sanitation progr=
amme
  progresses. Incidence rate curves from prevalence data are estimated
  parametrically via a Weibull-like survival function, and non-parametrical=
ly via
  maximum likelihood and monotonic splines. Sera collected from children an=
d
  adults in the 3 areas were used to detect antibodies against HAV through =
ELISA.
  Baseline incidence curves at the 3 sites estimated by the 3 methods were
  compared. A strong negative correlation was observed between level of
  sanitation and incidence rates for HAV infection. Incidence estimates yie=
lded
  by the parametric and non-parametric approaches tend to agree at early ag=
es in
  the micro-region showing the best level of sanitation and to increasingly
  disagree in the other 2. The results supported the choice of HAV as a sen=
tinel
  disease that is associated with level of sanitation. The use of monotonic
  splines as a novel non-parametric approach to estimate incidence from
  prevalence data are discussed.

  epidemiology and reasons for high CFRs. About 53% of cases were from Delh=

  they were not limited to any particular area. All the deaths and 92% (131=
/143)
  of cases occurred in children below 10 years of age. Only 12% of cases ha=
d
  received one or more doses of DPT. Muslims contributed significantly more=
 cases
  than Hindus. CFRs were significantly higher in young (P =3D 0.03) and
  unvaccinated (P =3D 0.01) children and in those who received antitoxin on=
 the
  third day of illness or later (P =3D 0.03). The study highlights the impo=
rtance
  of improved vaccine coverage and early diagnosis and prompt administratio=

AB: Before the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination was widely offered, =
the
  epidemiologic data about mumps (morbidity, immunization level, vaccine
  coverage) were analysed in Piedmont region (Italy). The disease had a 3- =
to 5
  -year epidemic recurrence with morbidity rate between 40 and 150/100 000;=
 the
  surveillance conducted by 'sentinel' pediatricians showed that the
  notifications underestimated the real data by about 5- to 7-fold. The 12-=
year
  -old subjects showed an immunization level (reached by the disease or the
  vaccination) of about 50% and their parents tended to refuse the MMR
  vaccination. Only 54% of the 3- to 5-year-old children received the MMR v=
accine
  in the second year of life and the frequency of the vaccination failure w=
as
  about 10%. The strategy of vaccination should take into account this
  epidemiologic pattern, to program an offer adequate to reach mumps
  control/elimination; the strategy of the region should include the active=
 offer
  in the second year of life to reach higher coverage, a second offer at 4-=
6
  and/or 12 years of life, when other vaccinations are given and the choice=
 of a
  highly efficacious vaccine. The improvement of the notification system co=
uld
  also allow a more sensitive surveillance of epidemiologic patterns.

AB: The occurrence of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MT) is a sentinel eve=
nt in
  occupational and environmental medicine. The association of pleural MT an=
d
  asbestos exposure is well documented and it is well known that no thresho=
ld can
  be demonstrated below which there is no risk of developing MT. During the
  period 1994-1998, 3 patients were referred from the Pneumology Division t=
o the
  Occupational Medicine Department of the Spedali Civili in Brescia, Italy.=
 They
  had MT and they had a peculiar asbestos exposure. A thorough occupational=
 and
  environmental history was taken by means of a standardized questionnaire.=
 The
  first patient was environmentally exposed to crocidolite when she lived n=
ear an
  asbestos mine in Australia. The second was a teacher and the third was a
  goldsmith and both were occupationally exposed to asbestos. The case
  descriptions revealed the importance of a standardized evaluation of
  occupational and environmental exposure to asbestos. In this way otherwis=
e
  ignored asbestos exposures can be identified therefore avoiding an
  underestimation of MT attributable to asbestos. The role of the occupatio=
nal
  physician, both in hospital referrals and while taking standardized histo=
ries,
  is also stressed along with the importance of this contribution on the on=
e hand
  to the epidemiological recording of sentinel events and on the other to t=
he
  aetiological definition of the cases.

AB: In 1998 an epidemic of enterovirus 71 infection caused hand-foot-and-mo=
uth
  disease and herpangina in thousands of people in Taiwan, some of whom die=
d. The
  epidemiological aspects of this outbreak were studied. Cases of hand-foot=
-and
  -mouth disease or herpangina in ambulatory patients were reported to the =
Taiwan
  Department of Health by a mean of 818 sentinel physicians. Severe cases i=
n
  hospitalized patients were reported by 40 medical centres and regional
  hospitals. Viruses were isolated by 10 hospital laboratories and the Depa=
rtment
  of Health. The sentinel physicians reported 129 106 cases of hand-foot-an=
d
  -mouth disease or herpangina in 2 waves of the epidemic, which probably
  represents <10% of the estimated total number of cases. There were 405 pa=
tients
  with severe disease, most of whom were _5 years old; severe disease was s=
een in
  all regions of the island. Complications included encephalitis, aseptic
  meningitis, pulmonary oedema or haemorrhage, acute flaccid paralysis, and
  myocarditis. 78 patients died, 71 of whom (91%) were _5 years of age. Of =
the
  patients who died, 65 (83%) had pulmonary oedema or pulmonary haemorrhage=
.
  Among patients from whom a virus was isolated, enterovirus 71 was present=
 in
  48.7% of outpatients with uncomplicated hand-foot-and-mouth disease or
  herpangina, 75% of hospitalized patients who survived, and 92% of patient=
s who
  died. It is concluded that although several enteroviruses were circulatin=
g in
  Taiwan during the 1998 epidemic, enterovirus 71 infection was associated =
with
  most of the serious clinical manifestations and with nearly all the death=
s.
  Most of those who died were young, and the majority died of pulmonary oed=
ema
  and pulmonary haemorrhage.

TI: Credentialing for breast lymphatic mapping: how many cases are enough?

AB: The aim of this study was to evaluate the credentials of the use of sen=
tinel
  lymphatic mapping for breast cancer. The sentinel lymph node (SLN) is def=
ined
  as the first lymph node receiving lymphatic drainage from a tumour. The S=
LN
  accurately reflects the status of the axillary nodes in patients with ear=
ly
  -stage breast cancer, and SLN mapping is gaining widespread acceptance. F=
ew of
  the many published feasibility studies of lymphatic mapping for breast ca=
ncer
  have adequate numbers to assess the credentials of this new procedure. 50=
0
  consecutive SLN biopsies were performed at 1 institution, over a 20-month
  period, by 8 surgeons, using isosulfan blue dye and technetium-labelled s=
ulfur
  colloid. The authors reviewed each surgeon's success rate in finding the =
SLN
  and false-negative rate, relative to level of experience with the techniq=
ue.
  Lymphatic mapping performed by an experienced surgeon (surgeon A, B, or C=
) was
  associated with a higher success rate (94%) than when it was performed by=
 one
  with less experience (86%). 10 failed mapping procedures occurred in the =
first
  100 cases. For each of the ensuing 100 cases, there were 8, 6, 6 and 4 fa=
iled
  mapping procedures, suggesting that increasing experience does not eradic=
ate
  failed mapping procedures completely. The false-negative rate among 104
  patients in whom axillary dissection was planned in advance was 10.6% (5/=
47).
  Most false-negative results occurred early in the surgeon's experience: w=
hen
  the first 6 cases of every surgeon were excluded, the false-negative rate=
 fell
  to 5.2% (2/38). With increasing experience, failed SLN localizations and =
false
  -negative SLN biopsies occur less often. Combined dye and isotope localiz=
ation,
  enhanced histopathology, a back-up axillary dissection, and judicious cas=
e
  selection are required to avoid the high false-negative rate when the tec=
hnique
  is at the early stages of use by a given surgeon.

AB: Blood and serum from 3915 wild and domestic birds (2590 resident, 139
  migrant, and 1186 captive), representing 56 species collected in central
  Florida in 1989-97, were analysed for evidence of St. Louis encephalitis =
(SLE)
  virus transmission. All sera were tested for SLE haemagglutination inhibi=
tion
  (HI) antibody. Selected sera and bloods were tested for SLE neutralizing =
(NT)
  antibody and virus. The reproductive success of resident birds was highes=
t from
  1990-92 and lowest from 1994-97. Transmission of SLE to resident birds,
  especially mourning doves (Zenaida macroura), peaked during the summer of=
 1990,
  a year during which a widespread SLE epidemic was recorded in central Flo=
rida.
  The SLE antibody-positive resident birds 1st appeared during September of=
 the
  epidemic year. Some SLE, HI antibody-positive resident birds were capture=
d
  throughout 1991, but only 5% were yearlings, compared with 36% in 1990. B=
y
  1993, wild resident birds expressing HI and NT antibodies to SLE had near=
ly
  disappeared. None of the migrant birds tested were SLE-positive. Sentinel
  chickens maintained in Indian River County during the epidemic year
  seroconverted to SLE starting in early July with peak seroconversion rate=
s in
  August, September and October. High (_50%) SLE seroconversion rates in se=
ntinel
  chickens preceded those in wild birds by 10 weeks and preceded peak human=
 SLE
  transmission by at least 8 weeks. Major SLE epidemics in south Florida de=
pend
  on abundant wild bird populations, especially during the amplification ph=
ase of
  the transmission cycle. It is proposed that hard winter freezes along the
  temperate-subtropical climatic zone interface in central Florida, at _27=
=B030'
  North Latitude, opens foraging and nesting habitats for ground-feeding bi=
rds,
  resulting in high reproductive success and an abundance of seronegative
  individuals that rapidly amplify the SLE later in the year.

  affinis were also used as sentinels, caged adult A. melanimon were used o=

  the wetlands to test for pesticide efficacy and drift, and night-flying i=
nsects
  were sampled using ultraviolet light traps. Results showed no detectable
  reductions in the abundance or biomass of aquatic macroinvertebrates in t=
reated
  wetlands. Larval mosquitoes showed high survival in all areas. All adult
  mosquitoes died when caged over wetlands treated with malathion or permet=
hrin,
  but all survived in controls. All G. affinis survived. Flying insect abun=
dance
  decreased after insecticide application in both treated and control wetla=

AB: A study was conducted to measure the prevalence of and trends in HIV
  infections in populations defined by sentinel surveillance in Vietnam.
  Surveillance was conducted in 8 provinces in 1994, expanded to 12 in 1995=
 and
  to 20 in 1996. Sentinel populations were sexually transmitted disease (ST=
D)
  patients, female sex workers (FSW), injecting drug users (IDU), tuberculo=
sis
  (TB) patients, pregnant women and military conscripts. Samples were colle=
cted
  twice yearly for high-risk populations and once yearly for low-risk
  populations. The overall HIV epidemic in Vietnam comprised several differ=
ent
  smaller epidemics. It was primarily associated with injecting drug use, b=
ut its
  extent varies widely throughout the country. In 1998, HIV prevalence rate=
s
  ranged from 0 to 85% (median, 13.1%), with an aggregate prevalence rate (=
APR;
  i.e., the sum of HIV-positive study subjects divided by the sum of all st=
udy
  subjects tested in sentinel provinces) of 17% among IDUs; this ranged fro=
m 0 to
  14.7% (median, 0.8%), with the APR of 2.4% among FSWs, and from 0 to 6%
  (median, 0%), with the APR of 0.9% among STD patients. The APRs among ant=
enatal
  women and army conscripts were <0.15%. APRs increased significantly from =
1994
  to 1998 among STD patients (P<0.001), FSWs (P<0.001), TB patients (P<0.00=
1),
  and pregnant women (P<0.05) in original sentinel provinces. HIV prevalenc=
e also
  increased significantly among younger age groups of IDUs and FSWs. It is
  concluded that Vietnam's HIV epidemic is increasing predominantly and mos=
t
  rapidly among IDUs. Prevalence rates among FSWs and STD patients are risi=
ng,
  but are still low among pregnant women and army conscripts. Vietnam, at
  present, is still in the early phase of the HIV epidemic and has time to =
take
  effective and appropriate actions.

AB: A field trial in Zimbabwe investigated the efficacy of insecticide-trea=
ted
  cattle as a barrier to prevent the re-invasion of G. morsitans and G.
  pallidipes into cleared areas. The original tsetse barrier consisted of
  insecticide-treated odour-baited targets, at an operational density of 4-=
5
  targets per km2, supported by insecticide-treatments of cattle with eithe=
r
  deltamethrin dip (Decatix) at 2-weekly intervals, or deltamethrin pour-on
  (Spoton) at monthly intervals, in a band _20 km wide from the reinvasion =
front.
  Tsetse catch, and trypanosomiasis incidence in 9 sentinel herds was recor=
ded
  for 7-8 months, respectively, before the targets were removed, leaving on=
ly the
  insecticide treatment of the local cattle to stem the re-invasion of tset=
se.
  After the removal of the target barrier, the tsetse readily invaded the t=
rial
  area and the incidence of trypanosomiasis in sentinel herds increased, wh=
ile
  their packed cell volumes decreased. After 7 months without the targets i=
n
  place, trypanosomiasis prevalence in the local stock had reached alarming=
ly
  high levels; the trial was terminated prematurely and the target barrier =
re
  -deployed. Immediately after the re-deployment of the target barrier, the
  tsetse catch in the trial area reverted to acceptable levels along the re
  -invasion front, and trypanosomiasis incidence in the sentinel cattle
  decreased. It is concluded that, under the conditions of the field trial,=
 the
  insecticidal treatment of local cattle did not in itself form an effectiv=
e
  barrier to tsetse re-invasion. By contrast, the target barrier performed =
as was
  predicted by mathematical and experimental analysis, and readily cleared =
the
  tsetse infestation and reduced trypanosomosis incidence in the trial area=

AB: For the past decade, treatment of cattle with 0.00375% deltamethrin at =

  -weekly intervals has been part of an integrated approach to counteract
  continuous invasion of Zimbabwe by Glossina morsitans morsitans and G.
  pallidipes from the Mozambique fly-belt. To determine the effect of these
  regular deltamethrin treatments on the epidemiology of babesiosis, a surv=
ey was
  conducted to estimate the prevalence of antibodies against Babesia bigemi=
na in
  adult communal cattle. The seroprevalence of antibodies against B. bigemi=
na in
  adjacent areas, where cattle are treated with short-residual acaricides, =
was
  also determined for comparison. The prevalence of antibodies to B. bigemi=
na was
  much higher in areas where dipping with a non-pyrethroid acaricide was
  conducted. This was attributed to the successful control of Boophilus spp=
. and
  hence a very low level of Babesia bigemina transmission in the 'deltameth=
rin
  treatment zone'. This low level of disease transmission was confirmed by =
the
  low prevalence of antibodies against B. bigemina in sentinel cattle that =
were
  introduced to the 'deltamethrin treatment zone'. The potential adverse ef=
fects
  of severely reducing the tick population should be taken into considerati=
on at
  the onset of tsetse control operations in which cattle are to be treated =
with
  deltamethrin at short treatment intervals.

AB: GeoSentinel is a network of 22 member travel/tropical medicine clinics =
(14
  in the USA and 8 in other countries) initiated in 1995 by the Internation=
al
  Society of Travel Medicine (ISTM). GeoSentinel is based on the concept th=
at
  these clinics are ideally situated to effectively detect geographic and
  temporal trends in morbidity among travellers. The core surveillance tool=
 is a
  single-page faxable form submitted to a central data site for each post-t=
ravel
  patient, including immigrants, refugees, and foreign visitors. Diagnoses =
are
  entered either as specific aetiologies or as syndromes and are then linke=
d to
  geographic locations, reference dates, and clinical presentations. In add=
ition,
  electronic communication with the larger body of worldwide ISTM member cl=
inics
  is periodically done to obtain broader data collection in response to spe=
cific
  inquires. The scope of GeoSentinel has broadened from the initial vision =
of a
  provider-based sentinel network tracking emerging infections at their poi=
nt of
  entry into developed countries. Its present goals are: to monitor global =
trends
  in disease occurrence among travellers; to ascertain risk factors and mor=
bidity
  in groups of travellers categorized by travel purpose and type of travell=
er; to
  respond to urgent public health queries; to develop educational prioritie=
s for
  travellers' health; and to effect a rapid response by electronically
  disseminating alerts to surveillance sites, to all ISTM members in 55
  countries, and to public health authorities. In addition, a major byprodu=
ct of
  the network, and now one of its strongest assets, has been the growth of
  partnerships between ISTM, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and
  health-care providers around the world, as well as other medical societie=
s,
  government, and private organizations. The demographic data, travel patte=
rns,
  and clinical presentations for the first 2813 patient records analysed fr=

AB: Since 1994 a demographic surveillance system (with 5-monthly rounds) an=
d
  open adult cohort study have been established in a rural ward in Tanzania=
. Two
  sero-surveys of all resident adults aged 15-44 and 15-46 years were condu=
cted
  in 1994-95 and 1996-97 respectively. Qualitative data were collected on
  mobility, bars and commercial sex. Attendance at the 2 rounds of survey w=
as
  5820 (78%) and 6413 (80%) in 1994/95 and 1996/97 respectively. HIV preval=
ence
  increased from 5.8% to 6.6%. HIV incidence was 0.73 and 0.84 per 100 pers=
on
  years among men and women respectively. HIV incidence in those under the =
age of
  20 years was low among both sexes. Striking differences in HIV prevalence=
 and
  incidence were observed within the small geographical area studied: HIV
  prevalence in the trading centre was twice that in the area surrounding t=
he
  trading centre (within 2 km) and 3 to 4 times that in the rural villages
  (within 8 km of the trading centre). Aggregate level data showed signific=
ant
  differences between the trading centre and nearby rural villages in terms=
 of
  sexual behaviour, commercial sex workers, mobility of the population, and
  alcohol use. This study documents the existence of very substantial HIV
  prevalence and incidence differences within a small rural area. The rapid
  decrease in HIV prevalence within a small rural area emphasizes the impor=
tance
  of concentrating HIV prevention efforts on high transmission areas, such =
as
  trading centres, especially in resource-poor settings. Furthermore, this =
has
  considerable implications for monitoring the spread of HIV through sentin=
el
  sites, as such sites are typically located in high transmission areas.

AB: A study was conducted to monitor and analyse trends in HIV-1 seropreval=
ence
  among antenatal women in Nairobi, Kenya. Six sequential surveys were carr=
ied
  out among antenatal clinic attendees at 4 Nairobi City Council health cen=
tres
  between November 1991 and April 1997. 6828 women attending for first ante=
natal
  clinic visit were administered a standard questionnaire to obtain demogra=
phic
  information and were screened for HIV-1. HIV-1 seroprevalence increased f=
rom
  12.1% in the first survey to 16.2% in the third, completed in October 199=
3. No
  increase was observed in subsequent surveys, and seroprevalence among wom=
en
  aged <20 declined after the third survey. Significant differences in
  seroprevalence (P<0.001) were observed in all survey rounds between women=
 who
  reported that their province of origin was Nyanza (22.4% overall), compar=
ed
  with those from other provinces in western Kenya (14.1%), and the eastern=
 group
  of provinces (8.9%). The rise in HIV-1 seroprevalence observed between 19=
91 and
  1993 was almost entirely attributable to the rising seroprevalence among =
women
  from Nyanza. There were considerable differences in HIV-1 seroprevalence =
among
  the 4 health centres, partly accounted for by differences in the proporti=
on of
  clinic attendees from different provinces of origin, which also changed
  significantly over time. It is concluded that HIV-1 seroprevalence has
  stabilized in antenatal women attending these health centres in Nairobi, =
and
  may be declining among women in the youngest age group. This may reflect
  stabilization of HIV-1 incidence, but further observation is required. Th=
e
  levels of infection among Nairobi residents reflect the evolution of the =
HIV
  epidemic in their provinces of origin, and changing client composition
  influences HIV-1 seroprevalence at different clinics. HIV sentinel survei=
llance
  should be carried out at multiple sites in large urban centres to monitor
  accurately the evolution of the HIV epidemic and the impact of control ef=
forts
  in reducing transmission.

ts
  with positive smear were recruited from tuberculosis centres and rural he=
alth
  centres. Drug susceptibility testing was performed according to the propo=
rtion
  method. Positive cultures were tested against streptomycin, isoniazid,
  rifampicin and ethambutol. All resistant strains and 10% of all randomly
  sampled cultures were sent to an external laboratory for quality control.=
 Human
  immunodeficiency virus (HIV) tests were performed for consenting patients=
 at
  the tuberculosis centres. Among the 430 samples, 320 were available for
  analysis. Primary resistance to antituberculous drugs was observed for 13=
.4% of
  the patients (43 of 320); multidrug resistance (to at least isoniazid and
  rifampicin) was observed for 5.3% of the patients; 14.2% of HIV-negative =
and
  16.2% of HIV-positive patients were resistant to at least one antitubercu=
lous
  drug (P=3D0.70). It is concluded that this study is representative of
  antituberculous drug resistance in Cote d'Ivoire. The rate of primary
  resistance is high and emphasizes the need for a sentinel survey of tuber=
culous
  resistance. It is suggested that the National Tuberculosis Control Progra=
mme
  needs to make improvements in its management of tuberculosis cases.

AB: A study was conducted to document the level of HIV infection in Senegal=
 and
  also to review evidence of the impact of efforts in prevention, developed=
 by
  the National AIDS Control Programme and the Civil Society, on the level o=
f the
  HIV epidemic. The study involved research, compilation and critical revie=
w of
  all relevant data on HIV and sexually transmitted disease (STDs) epidemio=
logy,
  sexual behaviour, and the efforts in prevention developed in Senegal. Bet=
ween
  1989 and 1996, the levels of HIV infection estimated in 4 sentinel urban
  regions remained stable at around 1.2% in the population of pregnant wome=
n, and
  at 3% in male STD patients. HIV infection had increased to 19% in female =
sex
  workers. A strong political and community commitment led to an early resp=
onse
  to the HIV/AIDS epidemic that has been extended since 1986. Blood transfu=
sion
  safety was established at the start of the HIV epidemic. The level of kno=
wledge
  of preventive practices relating to HIV/AIDS among the general population
  exceeded 90% in the early 1990s. Between 1991 and 1996, a 30-66% decrease=
 of
  the STD prevalence rates was observed in pregnant women and sex workers i=
n
  Dakar. In 1997, 33% of men aged 15-49 years in Dakar reported having had =
sex
  with non-regular partners. Among them 67% reported condom use. It is conc=
luded
  that from available data, Senegal can rightfully claim to have contained =
the
  spread of HIV by intervening early and comprehensively to increase knowle=
dge
  and awareness of HIV/AIDS and to promote safe sexual behaviour.

AB: The circumstances of 2 cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in north
  Queensland in 1998 are described, including 1 acquired on the Australian
  mainland. Serological surveillance of sentinel pigs for JE virus activity=
 and
  serological surveys of humans and pigs and viral cultures of mosquito
  collections were undertaken. The study was conducted on islands in the To=
rres
  Strait and in communities in the Northern Peninsula Area (NPA) and near t=
he
  mouth of the Mitchell River in Cape York, Queensland, in the 1998 wet sea=
son
  (December 1997-May 1998). Sentinel pigs in the Torres Strait began to
  seroconvert to JE virus in February 1998, just before onset of JE in an
  unvaccinated 12-year-old boy on Badu island. By mid-April, most sentinel =
pigs
  had seroconverted. Numerous JE viruses were isolated from Culex annuliros=
tris
  mosquitoes collected on Badu. In early March, a person working at the mou=
th of
  the Mitchell River developed JE. Serological surveys showed recent JE vir=
us
  infection in 13 young pigs on a nearby farm, but not in 488 nearby reside=
nts.
  In NPA communities, sentinel pigs seroconverted slowly and JE viruses wer=
e
  isolated from 3, but none of 604 residents showed evidence of recent infe=
ction.
  Nucleotide sequencing showed that 1998 JE virus isolates from the Torres =
Strait
  were virtually identical not only to the 1998 isolate from an NPA pig, bu=
t also
  to previous (1995) Badu isolates. It was concluded that JE virus activity=
 was
  more widespread in north Queensland in the 1998 wet season than in the 3
  previous wet seasons, but ecological circumstances (e.g. less intensive p=
ig
  husbandry, fewer mosquitoes) appear to have limited transmission on the
  mainland. Nucleotide sequencing indicated a common source for the 1995 an=
d 1998
  JE viruses. Circumstantial evidence suggests that cyclonic winds carried
  infected mosquitoes from Papua New Guinea.

AB: A case is reported in a 49-year-old female office worker from Connectic=
ut,
  USA, who presented with progressive shortness of breath, fatigue, cough a=
nd
  cheek flushing; symptoms which improved at weekends but recurred while at=
 work.
  Chest X-ray revealed bilateral interstitial changes in the mid and lower =
lung
  zones and serological tests showed antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus. W=
ipe
  samples from the patient's desk showed A. fumigatus, Penicillium and Muco=
r spp.
  Office-related hypersensitivity pneumonitis was diagnosed. The patient's
  symptoms resolved while she was away from work, but recurred and worsened=
 when
  she returned. Eventually the patient returned to work at a different site=
 and
  has remained symptom-free for >4 years. A questionnaire survey was conduc=
ted at
  the building where the patient had originally worked. Building co-workers
  demonstrated substantially higher symptom rates than did controls in 5 ot=
her
  buildings, although no further cases of disease were identified. It is li=
kely
  that moisture sources in the building included an oversized cooling syste=
m and
  below-grade moisture, but the building met all applicable regulations and
  standards.

AB: The HIV-1 epidemic in Western Uganda and the possible impact of
  interventions were examined. Results from sentinel surveillance of HIV-1
  seroprevalence were compared with cross-sectional serosurvey data and mod=
el
  simulations. Age-specific trends in HIV-1 prevalence between 1991 and 199=
7
  amongst antenatal clinic (ANC) attenders in the town of Fort Portal, wher=
e a
  comprehensive AIDS control programme has been implemented since 1991, wer=
e
  analysed. Results were compared with outputs from a mathematical model
  simulating the HIV-1 epidemic in Uganda. Two scenarios were modelled: one
  without and one with behaviour change. Sentinel surveillance data were co=
mpared
  with data from a population-based HIV-1 serosurvey at the study site, whi=
ch was
  carried out in early 1995. Data from 3271 ANC attenders identified greate=
r
  education and being single as risk factors for HIV-1 infection. A signifi=
cant
  decrease of risk for women with secondary school education over time was
  observed, whereas the risk for illiterate women remained high. Among wome=
n aged
  15-19 years (n=3D1045) education and marital status-adjusted HIV-1 preval=
ence
  declined steadily from 32.2% in 1991 to 10.3% in 1997. For 20-24-year-old=
 women
  (n=3D1010) HIV-1 prevalence increased until 1993 from 19.9% to 31.7% and
  decreased thereafter (21.7% in 1997). These trends closely follow the
  prediction of the model simulation assuming behaviour change, and for 199=
5
  -1997, confidence intervals of the HIV-1 prevalence estimate exclude the =
model
  output for an uninfluenced epidemic. No clear trends of HIV-1 prevalence =
were
  found in older women (n=3D1216) and comparisons with the model were ambig=
uous.
  Sentinel surveillance data at the time of the population survey closely
  reflected results for the female general population sample for the two yo=
unger
  age-groups (15-19 and 20-24 years). In contrast, pregnant women aged 25-2=
9
  years showed significantly lower rates than the population sample (20.8% =
versus
  45.1%). HIV-1 prevalence amongst ANC attenders aged 15-24 years can be us=
ed to
  monitor the HIV-1 epidemic in the given setting. Declining trends of HIV-=
1
  prevalence in women aged 15-19 and 20-24 years most likely correspond to =
a
  reduced HIV-1 incidence attributable to changes in behaviour. The data al=
so
  show that sentinel surveillance data need to be age-stratified to give us=
eful
  information.

  contaminant residues were studied in human blood and urine specimens from=
 32
  sport fish consumers from 3 Great Lakes: Lake Michigan (n=3D10), Lake Hur=

  (n=3D11) and Lake Erie (n=3D11). Serum was analysed for 8 polychlorinated=

  analysed for 10 nonpersistent pesticides (or their metabolites) and 5 met=
als.
  One individual was excluded from statistical analysis because of an unusu=
al

average,
  49 GL sport fish meals per year for a mean of 33 years. On average, the g=
eneral
  population in the GL basin consume 6 meals of GL sport fish per year. The=
 mean
  tissue levels of most persistent, bioaccumulative compounds also found in=
 GL
  sport fish ranged from less than a 2-fold increase to that of PCB 126, wh=
ich
  was 8-fold the selected background levels found in the general population=
. The
  overall mean total toxic equivalent for dioxins, furans and coplanar PCBs=
 were
  greater than selected background levels in the general population (dioxin=
s, 1.8
  -fold; furans, 2.4-fold; and coplanar PCBs, 9.6-fold). The nonpersistent
  pesticides and most metals were not identified in unusual concentrations.=
 A
  contaminant pattern among lake subgroups was evident. Lake Erie sport fis=
h
  consumers had consistently lower contaminant concentrations than consumer=
s of
  sport fish from Lakes Michigan and Huron. These inter-lake differences we=
re
  consistent with contaminant patterns seen in sport fish tissue from the

  proved to be effective sentinels for identifying sport fish contaminants =
of
  concern. In the larger study to follow, serum samples will be tested for =
PCBs
  (congener specific and coplanar), DDE, dioxin and furans.

  provinces of Thailand was initiated in 1989 and has been conducted annual=
ly
  since 1995. This report summarizes the main results from the June to mid-=
July
  1998 survey. Sentinel populations in each province were selected and test=
ed.
  National HIV prevalence among commercial sex workers (CSWs) working in di=
rect
  (brothels) and indirect sex establishments was 21% and 6.8%, respectively=
,
  lower than the previous year. Male sex workers showed a median prevalence=
 of
  15%. HIV infection among donated blood was 0.39% and from injecting drug =
users
  patients was 46.8%. Prevalence among males attending government sexually
  transmitted disease (STD) clinics was 8.5%, a slight increase from 7% of =
the
  previous year. Routine HIV testing of 62 389 pregnant women revealed a me=
dian
  prevalence of 1.54% in all age groups with 1.2% for women aged <20 years.
  Pregnant women attending provincial antenatal clinics had higher HIV prev=
alence
  (1.88%) compared to those attending district hospitals (1.32%). Prevalenc=
e of
  HIV among new conscripts was 1.9% (522 of 26 848). It is concluded that d=
uring
  the current economic crisis, HIV prevalence among CSWs and pregnant women=
 and
  conscripts was stable or slightly lower than the previous year. Several
  provinces should be considered priority areas for HIV control programmes,=
 such
  as the Eastern sea coast area, provinces in the South bordering Myanmar a=
nd the
  upper Northern region of Thailand. Interventions, such as short course AZ=
T, for
  pregnant women should be implemented to prevent HIV perinatal transmissio=

  health district and (2) province-wide sentinel surveillance for antenatal=
 HIV
  infection, legally required notification of cases of PTB, and voluntary

ures:
  4.2% vs 4.8% in 1992 to 25.9% vs 26.9% in 1997. PTB incidence increased 4=

  in the sentinel district over the study period, whereas provincial PTB fi=
gures
  from passive surveillance fluctuated widely and showed no clear increase =
(Chi
  -square for trend 425.5, P<0.00001). AIDS incidence in the sentinel distr=
ict
  increased dramatically while provincial data from the voluntary reporting
  system showed a less consistent and much slower rise (Chi-square for tren=
d
  9.07, P=3D0.003). Incidence of AIDS in 1997 was estimated as 437/105 in t=

  sentinel district compared to 32/105 in the provincial figures. Routine d=
isease
  notification and voluntary reporting systems are likely to underestimate =
the
  impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in resource-poor settings. Sentinel
  surveillance at representative sites should be developed to validate or r=

amme
  during 1995-96, data from medical records of 22 565 randomly selected stu=
dents
  from >100 job training centres throughout the USA were evaluated. An esti=
mated
  5.6% of students had a documented positive skin test or history of active
  tuberculosis. Rates were highest among those who were racial/ethnic minor=
ities,
  foreign born and (among foreign-born students) older in age (P<0.001). We=
ighted
  rates (adjusting for sampling) were 1.3% for white, 2.2% for Native Ameri=
can,
  4.0% for black, 9.6% for Hispanic and 40.7% for Asian/Pacific Islander
  students; rates were 2.4% for US-born and 32.7% for foreign-born students=
.
  Differences by geographical region of residence were not significant afte=
r
  adjusting for other demographic factors. It is concluded that tuberculin
  screening of socioeconomically disadvantaged youth such as evaluated in t=
his
  study provides important sentinel surveillance data concerning groups at =

AB: Study participants, enrolled by 47 sexually transmitted diseases (STD)
  centres throughout Italy between January 1991 and December 1996, included
  individuals with a newly diagnosed STD who were tested for HIV at the tim=
e of
  the STD diagnosis and who had a previous documented HIV-negative test.
  'Seroconverters' were defined as those individuals who tested HIV-positiv=
e at
  the time of the STD diagnosis. The cumulative and the annual incidence of=
 HIV
  in this population were estimated. Of 1950 patients, 47 were seroconverte=
rs,
  with an incidence rate of 1.7 per 100 person-years (PY) (95% confidence
  interval, 1.2-2.2). HIV incidence was higher among males than among femal=
es
  (2.5 vs. 0.6 per 100 PY). The highest incidence rate was found among homo=
sexual
  injecting drug users (IDU) (13.8 per 100 PY), whereas the lowest rate was
  observed among heterosexual non-IDU (0.4 per 100 PY). The annual incidenc=
e
  decreased from 1.8 per 100 PY in 1989 to 0.9 per 100 PY in 1996. These re=
sults
  show that new HIV infections have occurred among STD patients in Italy si=
nce
  1988, although a clear decrease in incidence has occurred since 1989. How=
ever,
  the rate of seroconversion appears to be alarmingly high in some high-ris=
k
  groups. These findings suggest that there is a need for continued monitor=
ing of
  new HIV infections among STD patients, and these individuals may represen=
t a
  useful sentinel population for a better understanding of the HIV epidemic=

AB: A study was conducted to describe the epidemiology of varicella among
  Italian children and to assess the resulting economic and health burden o=
n the
  country. 39 Italian paediatricians participated in a sentinel network on
  paediatric infectious diseases representing a total paediatric population=
 of 30
  168 children. Each case of varicella observed during January to December =
1997
  was recorded. Economic analysis was conducted from the societal point of =
view.
  All costs were broken down into 2 groups: direct and indirect costs. 1599=
 cases
  of varicella were reported among children aged 0 to 14 years old. There w=
ere
  1266 primary cases (mean age, 4.5=B12 years) and 333 secondary cases (mea=
n age,
  3.6=B13.2 years). The global incidence of varicella was 51.01 per 1000 pe=
r year.
  Complications were seen in 56 cases (3.5%). Drugs were prescribed in 672 =
cases.
  A group of adults (364 susceptible and 193 with uncertain status) were ex=
posed
  to primary cases. 70 (12.5%) were eventually infected among whom there we=
re 4
  pregnant women. For paediatric patients an average cost of US$146.90 (250=
 400
  lire) was estimated; this is largely accounted for by indirect costs. It =
is
  concluded that the epidemiology of varicella in Italy is consistent with =
that
  found in previous studies in industrialized countries. It is suggested th=
at the
  health arguments in favour of universal vaccination of children >18 month=
s of
  age do not differ in Italy from those of other industrialized nations.

AB: The results of recently completed trials in Africa of insecticide-treat=

  bed nets (ITBN) offer new possibilities for malaria control. These experi=
mental
  trials aimed for high ITBN coverage combined with high re-treatment rates=
.
  Whilst necessary to understand protective efficacy, the approaches used t=
o
  deliver the intervention provide few indications of what coverage of net =
re
  -treatment would be under operational conditions. Varied delivery and fin=
ancing
  strategies have been proposed for the sustainable delivery of ITBNs and r=
e
  -treatment programmes. Following the completion of a randomized, controll=
ed
  trial on the Kenyan coast in 1993-95, a series of suitable delivery strat=
egies
  were used to continue net re-treatment (with permethrin) in the area. The=
 trial
  adopted a bi-annual, house-to-house re-treatment schedule free of charge =
using
  research project staff, and resulted in over 95% coverage of nets issued =
to
  children. During the year following the trial, sentinel dipping stations =
were
  situated throughout the community and household members informed of their
  position and opening times. This free re-treatment service achieved betwe=
en 61
  -67% coverage of nets used by children for 3 years. In 1997, a social mar=
keting
  approach, that introduced cost-retrieval, was used to deliver the net re
  -treatment services. The immediate result of this transition was that
  significantly fewer of the mothers who had used the previous re-treatment
  services adopted this revised approach and coverage declined to 7%. The f=
uture
  of new delivery services and their financing are discussed in the context=
 of
  their likely impact upon previously defined protective efficacy and cost
  -effectiveness estimates.

 s.c. or
  intracerebrally inoculated with Oshima strain was slower and of lower tit=

LA: English
AB: A randomised study of the effect of insecticide spraying on diarrhoea
  incidence was undertaken. 6 study villages were randomly assigned to 2 gr=
oups.
  Flies (98% Musca domestica) were controlled by deltamethrin application i=
n
  group A in 1995 and in group B in 1996. In 1997 the effectiveness of bait=
ed fly
  traps was tested in group A villages. Diarrhoea episodes were monitored i=
n
  children under 5 years through mothers' reports during weekly visits by a
  health visitor. Fly density was monitored by use of sticky fly-papers hun=
g in
  sentinel compounds. During the fly seasons (March-June) of both 1995 and =
1996,
  insecticide application practically eliminated the fly population in the
  treated villages. The incidence of diarrhoea was lower in the sprayed vil=
lages
  than in the unsprayed villages in both 1995 (mean episodes per child-year=
 6.3
  vs. 7.1) and 1996 (4.4 vs. 6.5); the reduction in incidence was 23% (95% =
CI 11
  -33, P=3D0.007). At times other than the fly season there was no evidence=
 of a
  difference in diarrhoea morbidity between sprayed and unsprayed villages.=
 Fly
  density data for 1997 indicate the ineffectiveness of baited traps in thi=
s
  setting. It is concluded that fly control can have an impact on diarrhoea
  incidence similar to, or greater than, that of the interventions currentl=
y
  recommended by WHO for inclusion in diarrhoeal disease control programmes=
 in
  developing countries.

AB: The relation between cigarette smoking and the occurrence of influenza,=
 the
  efficacy of influenza vaccination and the antibody response to influenza
  vaccination was examined in 15 family practices in South-Limburg, Netherl=
ands,
  during the influenza season 1991-1992. Data were used from a randomized d=
ouble
  -blind placebo-controlled trial into the efficacy of influenza vaccinatio=
n in
  which smoking status was measured 10 weeks after the start of the trial. =
1838
  subjects aged 60 years or older, of whom 1531 subjects (321 smokers, 1152=
 non
  -smokers and 58 cigar/pipe smokers) who returned the smoking questionnair=
e and
  were not previously vaccinated, were used in the analyses. The main outco=
me
  measures were serological influenza (fourfold increase of antibody titre
  between 3 weeks and 5 months after vaccination); clinical influenza as
  determined by criteria of the Dutch Sentinel Stations from self reported
  symptoms in postal questionnaires 10 weeks and 5 months after vaccination=
;
  increases after vaccination and decreases after 5 months in logarithmic t=
itres
  of antibody against the vaccine strains. No relation between smoking and =
either
  serological or clinical influenza was found, although the risk for serolo=
gical
  influenza was slightly (not significantly) elevated in smokers compared t=
o non
  -smokers. A statistical interaction was found between smoking and vaccina=
tion
  when serological influenza was the outcome measure indicating that the ef=
ficacy
  of vaccination was greater in smokers than in non-smokers (comparison of =
model
  with and without interaction; likelihood ratio test, P<0.0001). This find=
ing is
  supported by a greater titre rise 3 weeks after vaccination for two out o=
f four
  strains, but not by the antibody response after vaccination in previous s=
tudies
  on influenza and other infectious diseases. Also, this possible differenc=
e of
  immunogenicity is not reflected in a better protection for clinical influ=
enza.
  The rise in antibody titre 3 weeks after vaccination was higher in smoker=
s for
  A/Singapore/6/86 and B/Beijing/11/87, but not for the other two strains.
  Decline in titres after 5 months was similar for smokers and non-smokers.=
 It is
  concluded that smoking has no clinical or preventive significance for ris=
k of
  influenza in the elderly.

  information confirmed the previous data provided by the national system:
  frequency of diarrhoea in health centres (4.14%), occurrence of the disea=
se
  especially in the summer period, rate of hospitalization (10%) and low
  proportion of severe dehydration. The system also gave some new informati=
on
  related to the proportion of persistent diarrhoea (7.1%), the low frequen=
cy of
  malnutrition (11%) and the aetiology. The sentinel surveillance system
  validates information previously provided by the National Surveillance Sy=
stem.
  It also gave new information not obtained by the classical surveillance s=
ystem.

AB: To estimate the prevalence of infection by hepatitis C virus (HCV) in
  general practice, and to investigate attitudes to screening for HCV, a sp=
ecific
  questionnaire was sent to the sentinel general practitioners (SGPs) of th=
e
  French Sentinel Network. From the figures reported by SGPs, the number of=
 anti
  -HCV tests performed in general practice during the 6 months before the s=
urvey
  (July-December 1994) was extrapolated to about 350 000 tests for the whol=
e of
  France during all of 1994 (95% CI: 314 000-382 000). Of the 312 participa=
ting
  SGPs, 224 (72%) had prescribed at least one anti-HCV test during these 6
  months, and 217 (70%) knew of at least one anti-HCV-positive patient in t=
heir
  practice. With regard to their screening attitudes, 244 SGPs (78%) said t=
hey
  had prescribed anti-HCV tests for patients with no signs of previous or r=
ecent
  hepatitis infection; SGPs who had at least two HCV-positive patients in t=
heir
  practice were more likely to screen for anti-HCV than SGPs who did not (9=
4% vs.
  72%, P<0.001). The main reason for prescription were that patients had an=
 anti
  -HIV-positive status, were intravenous drug users and/or were blood trans=
fusion
  recipients. For the 88 SGPs who had not prescribed any anti-HCV test duri=
ng the
  6 months before the study, the main reasons given were that few patients =
were
  at risk in their practice (81 SGPs) and that the risk factors for HCV inf=
ection
  were not well known (12 SGPs). Only 6 SGPs gave the absence of effective
  treatment as a reason for non-prescription. From the figures reported by =
SGPs,
  the number of anti-HCV-positive patients known by the 52,000 French gener=
al
  practitioners in 1994 was extrapolated to 100 000 (95% CI: 90 000-110 000=
).
  These results indicate that the Sentinel network may be a useful tool for
  assessing the evolution of attitudes to HCV screening in general practice=

TI: Hoarding of animals: an under-recognized public health problem in a

AB: The objective of this study was to better characterize the problem of
  hoarding, or pathological collecting, of animals. Data from a convenience
  sample of 54 case reports from 10 animal control agencies and humane soci=
eties
  across the USA produced between 1992 and 1996 were analysed. Most (76%) o=
f
  hoarders were female, and 46% were 60 years of age or older. About half o=
f the
  hoarders lived in single-person households. The animals most frequently
  involved were cats, dogs, farm animals and birds. The median number of an=
imals
  per case was 39, but there were 4 cases of more than 100 animals in a
  household. In 80% of cases animals were reportedly found dead or in poor
  condition. Prevalence estimates extrapolated from these data range from 7=
00 to
  2000 cases annually in the USA. It is concluded that public health author=
ities
  should recognize that animal hoarding may be a sentinel for mental health
  problems or dementia, which merit serious assessment and prompt intervent=
ion.
  It is suggested that improved cooperation between humane societies and pu=
blic
  health authorities could facilitate the resolution of animal hoarding cas=
es.

  affected nutritional state. The OPMSS combined repeated cross-section, ra=

tra
  -containing foods as well as intensive dietary and clinical assessments o=
n a
  subsample of survey participants. Data were from baseline telephone (n=3D=
1962)
  and clinical (n=3D1069) assessment of subjects (aged 18 to 74 years) in t=
he
  Marion County, Indiana, USA. Mean age of participants in the telephone su=
rvey
  was 43.2 years; 19% of respondents were black and 29% had completed colle=
ge.
  Analyses examined associations among savory snack use, fruit and vegetabl=
e
  consumption and demographic and health-related characteristics. Data from=
 the
  telephone survey were adjusted to be representative of the Marion County
  population. Almost 96% of the population surveyed had eaten savory snacks=
 in
  the month before the survey: 74% had eaten regular-fat, 26% fat-reduced a=
nd 78%
  non-fat types. Total snack consumption did not differ by gender, educatio=
n or
  race. Residents younger than 35 years ate snacks 16 times a month compare=
d with
  12 times a month among older residents. Types of snacks consumed differed
  markedly by demographic characteristics. Male, younger and less educated
  residents are more regular-fat snacks; female, white and college-educated
  residents ate more non-fat snacks. Subjects practicing healthy behaviour,
  including not smoking, eating fruit and vegetables and exercising, also a=
te
  fewer regular-fat and more non-fat snacks. Fat intake was also related li=
nearly
  to use of snack foods, ranging from 33.2% of energy among those consuming=
 1
  serving per month or less to 36.8% among those consuming 20 or more servi=
ngs
  per month. Procedures for recruitment and nutrition assessment appear ade=
quate
  for evaluating the impact of olestra consumption on nutritional state. Th=
ere is
  potential for relatively high olestra consumption, given that almost 35% =
of
  Marion County residents eat snack foods at least 20 times a month. Consum=
ers
  eating at least 20 servings of snacks per month derived more than 12% of =
total
  energy and fat from snack foods, which suggests that substituting olestra
  snacks could substantially reduce fat and energy intake.

n in
  hyper, meso, and hypoendemic communities was investigated in Cameroon.
  Parasitological parameters of infection prevalence and intensity were com=

  If a sentinel population of individuals aged 5-15 years was used to compa=

  communities, all could be equally ranked by serological and parasitologic=

AB: The 1997-98 influenza season in the Netherlands was marked by influenza
  A/H3N2 activity which never reached a true epidemic level. There was no r=
eal
  peak activity either but a prolonged period of increased activity of
  approximately 8 weeks with a maximum in week 13, when sentinel physicians
  reported 16.6 cases of influenza-like illness per 10 000 inhabitants. It =
was
  not until week 18 of 1998 that the influenza activity declined to baselin=
e
  levels. During the season, almost exclusively influenza A/H3N2 viruses we=
re
  isolated, of which the majority resembled the new strain influenza
  A/Sydney/5/97(H3N2). Further analysis of these variant viruses revealed t=
hat,
  although there was some cross-reactivity with the vaccine strain
  (A/Nanchang/933/95), no optimal protection could be expected to be induce=
d by
  the vaccine. Antigenic characterization of the sporadic influenza A/H1N1 =
and
  influenza B viruses showed that these were related to the vaccine strains=
. As a
  result of these findings, the WHO recommended to change the H3N2 strain i=
n the
  influenza vaccine for the season 1998-99 to an influenza A/Sydney/5/97(H3=
N2)
  -like strain. Based on epidemiological data from other countries, it was =
also
  decided to change the influenza A/H1N1 component to an influenza
  A/Beijing/262/95 (H1N1)-like strain.

AB: A 5-year sentinel surveillance of diphtheria was undertaken at a rural
  medical college hospital in West Bengal, India, from 1989 to 1993. No
  significant change in the number of diphtheria cases was observed in spit=
e of a
  sustained high level of 3-dose diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus vaccine (DPT3=
)
  coverage. Most of the diphtheria cases occurred during July-November. The=
 age
  distribution of diphtheria cases showed that >75% were >2 years of age (e=
xcept
  in 1989), and that around 65% were >3 years of age. The age shift in diph=
theria
  prevalence signified the success of primary diphtheria immunization, as w=
ell as
  indicating the lack of coverage with booster doses at appropriate ages. B=
ecause
  of high coverage with primary diphtheria immunization, there was a decrea=
se in
  circulating toxigenic Corynebacterium diphtheriae, resulting in less natu=
ral
  boosting of antibody titre. Thus, in the absence of booster immunization,=
 the
  older children and adults were more vulnerable to diphtheria. It is concl=
uded
  that the findings of the study justify the need to emphasize the importan=
ce of
  booster diphtheria immunization at appropriate ages to ensure effective c=
ontrol
  of diphtheria.

ks
  were collected in the area by 2 collection methods in 1995 and virus isol=
ation
  was conducted on ticks in 1995 and 1996. I. ovatus was found to be the
  predominant tick species in the area; there were also small numbers of I.
  tanuki, I. persulcatus and Haemaphysalis flava. In 1996, 2 virus strains =
were
  isolated from 600 I. ovatus ticks (300 females and 300 males), giving the
  minimum infection rate of 0.33% (2 of 600). The 2 virus strains were iden=
tified
  as TBE virus by antigenic analysis using monoclonal antibodies and the in=
direct
  immunofluorescent antibody test. The results showed that I. ovatus was a
  suspected vector of the emerging TBE virus in Hokkaido.

il
  1997 with suspected Murray Valley encephalitis. He subsequently died. The
  diagnosis was supported by the detection of flavivirus IgM in cerebrospin=
al
  fluid. Low titres of IgM specific to Murray Valley encephalitis and Alfuy=
 were
  detected in a single serum sample. The patient's travel movements indicat=
e that
  his infection was acquired in the Alice Springs vicinity. This conclusion=
 was

 in

AB: In a rural area of southeastern Tanzania, studies were undertaken on th=
e
  dispersal and survival of A. funestus and A. gambiae s.l. during the rain=
y
  season in 1990. Blood fed, resting mosquitoes were collected indoors, mar=

  with fluorescent powder and released on the same day from 2 different sit=
es in
  the study area. For 2 weeks indoor resting mosquitoes were collected from=
 11
  houses in the release area. Additional collections were made with a light=
 trap
  from a sentinel house in the centre of the study area. A. funestus was mo=
re
  abundant than A. gambiae s.l. Of 4262 A. funestus and 645 A. gambiae s.l.
  released, 4.3% and 7.4%, respectively, were recaptured. Dispersal of mosq=
uitoes
  was not random: 1 of 3 areas was favoured significantly more than the oth=
er
  areas, as shown by the recapture and movement rates of marked mosquitoes.=
 Based
  on the regression of the recapture rate, estimated daily survival rates o=
f A.
  funestus and A. gambiae s.l. were 0.63 and 0.78, respectively. These were
  significantly different. The differences in dispersal and survival rates
  between the 2 species are discussed in view of local topography and speci=

  patient characterized by numerous lesions, particularly warty and persist=
ent
  (approx. 1 year), at the level of the cheek and lip mucosa is reported. T=
he
  clinical history evidenced a hepatitis A infection at the age of 25 and a
  secondary syphilis infection at the age of 26. Histological examination o=
f one
  of the lesions confirmed the clinical suspicion of condilomata acuminata.=
 The
  molecular hybridization evidenced human papillomaviruses (HPVs) type 16 a=
nd 18
  at a "high oncogenetic risk". Due to the atypical site, the large number =
of
  lesions and their persistence, a cell-mediated immunodeficiency was first=
ly
  hypothesized and then confirmed by the positive outcome of ELISA and West=
ern
  blot HIV tests. This case underlines how a frequently observed pathology
  ("sentinel infection") could signal a more serious disease. It is thus
  indispensable to perform the HIV test in all patients who have a sexually
  transmitted disease, in particular when their clinical aspect is atypical=
 and
  the manifestations are persistent. The discovery of the presence of HPV 1=
6 and
  18 in a lesion fragment, lead to important prognostic problems especially=
 in
  those patients that have a cell-mediated immunodeficiency.

AB: The SENTRY Program was established in January 1997 to measure the
  predominant pathogens and antimicrobial resistance patterns of nosocomial=
 and
  community-acquired infections over a broad network of sentinel hospitals =
in the
  USA (30 sites), Canada (8 sites), South America (10 sites) and Europe (24
  sites). During the first 6-month study period (January to June 1997), 505=
8
  bloodstream infections (BSI) were reported by North American SENTRY
  participants (4119 from the USA and 939 from Canada). In the USA and Cana=
da,
  Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were the most common BSI isola=
tes,
  followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci. Klebsiella =
spp.,
  Enterobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and =
beta
  -hemolytic streptococci were also among the 10 most frequently reported s=
pecies
  in the USA and Canada. Although the rank orders of pathogens in the USA a=
nd
  Canada were similar, distinct differences were noted in the antimicrobial
  susceptibilities of several pathogens. Overall, isolates from the USA wer=
e
  considerably more resistant than those from Canada. The differences in th=
e
  proportions of oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates (26.2 v=
s.
  2.7% for US and Canadian isolates, respectively), vancomycin-resistant
  enterococcal isolates (17.7 vs. 0% for US and Canadian isolates, respecti=
vely),
  and ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacter sp. isolates (30.6 vs. 6.2% for US=
 and
  Canadian isolates, respectively) dramatically emphasize the relative lack=
 of
  specific antimicrobial resistance genes in the Canadian microbial populat=
ion.
  Among US isolates, resistance to oxacillin among staphylococci, to vancom=
ycin
  among enterococci, to penicillin among pneumococci, and to ceftazidime am=
ong
  Enterobacter spp. was observed in both nosocomial and community-acquired
  pathogens, although in almost every instance the proportion of resistant
  strains was higher among nosocomial isolates. It was concluded that
  antimicrobial resistance continues to increase, and ongoing surveillance =
of
  microbial pathogens and resistance profiles is essential on national and
  international scales.

AB: Pet and wildlife populations are a potential source of various public h=
ealth
  problems, and injuries and complications due to animal bites and scratche=
s are
  the most obvious. As no population based data on the frequency of animal =
bites
  were available at a national level in Switzerland, a study was conducted =
by the
  Swiss Sentinel Surveillance Network. The objectives of this study were to
  estimate the incidence of medical consultations due to bite and scratch
  injuries in humans caused by vertebrate animals, to identify possible ris=
k
  factors, and to assess bite management habits in primary health care. An =
annual
  bite and scratch incidence rate of 325 per 100 000 population was estimat=
ed.
  Consultations peaked during the summer months and geographical difference=
s in
  the reported incidence were observed. Dogs accounted for more than 60% an=
d cats
  for about 25% of all cases reported. Animal bites and scratches were freq=
uent
  in persons under 20 years of age. In most ages, the incidence was higher =
among
  women than among men, but not in children under the age of ten years. The
  incidence of cat bites was especially high in adult women. Bites to the h=
ead
  and neck were most frequent in infants and young children and accounted f=
or
  approximately one third of the reported cases in this age group. Patients
  sought medical care principally for primary wound care (52.0%) and for
  vaccination advice (29.6%). Rabies postexposure prophylaxis was initiated=
 in
  1.1% of patients. Wound infection was reported in 10.9% of cases, with ca=
t
  bites/scratches being more often infected than injuries due to dogs.
  Hospitalization was reported in 0.3% of patients. Data from the emergency
  department of two district hospitals showed that head and neck injuries w=
ere
  more frequent in out-patients and a higher proportion of persons presente=
d with
  wound infections (14.1%). The hospitalization rate for emergency departme=
nt
  visits was 4.7%. Animal bites and scratches are common events in Switzerl=
and.
  They represent a public health issue of growing importance due to the ste=
adily
  increasing pet population. A practice based sentinel surveillance system =
may be
  an appropriate tool to monitor national trends in animal bites and scratc=
hes.

AB: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of sexually
  transmitted diseases (STDs) among pregnant women in Thailand, where case
  reporting suggests a marked decrease in STDs following a 1991 campaign
  promoting condom use during commercial sex. This cross sectional study in=
volved
  women at their first visit to the study hospitals' antenatal clinics in C=
hiang
  Rai (n=3D500) and Bangkok (n=3D521) [date not given]. First catch urine s=
pecimens
  were tested for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae using the
  Amplicor CT/NG polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Syphilis and HIV
  serological testing were performed in the study hospitals' laboratories. =
The
  prevalence of chlamydial infection was 5.7%, gonorrhoea 0.2%, and syphili=
s
  0.5%. The prevalence of HIV infection was 7.1% in Chiang Rai and 2.9% in
  Bangkok. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, chlamydial infec=
tion
  was associated with younger age and with higher gestational age at first
  antenatal clinic visit, but was not associated with marital status, gravi=
dity,
  city of enrolment, or HIV infection status. It is concluded that there wa=
s a
  low prevalence of gonorrhoea and syphilis among these pregnant women in
  Thailand. Chlamydial infection was detected at a higher prevalence, espec=
ially
  among younger women and women registering later for antenatal care. It is
  suggested that testing of pregnant women using easily collected urine spe=
cimens
  and a sensitive nucleic acid amplification assay is a feasible method of
  rapidly assessing chlamydial and gonococcal prevalence.

stern
  Guatemala. Of 376 confirmed tuberculosis (TB) cases during July 1993-June=
 1994,
  335 (89%) were culture-positive. Tests of drug sensitivities to 4 first-l=
ine
  antituberculous drugs (isoniazid, streptomycin, rifampicin and ethambutol=
) were
  performed in 172 (51%) of the culture-positive cases. 51 patients (30%) w=
ere
  resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent, and 26 (15%) were resistan=
t to
  _2 drugs. In a multivariate model of clinically available patient
  characteristics, only cavitary disease (odds ratio (OR)=3D2.1; 95% confid=
ence
  interval (CI), 1.1-6.6) and a history of taking anti-TB medication for >2=
 weeks
  (OR=3D3.0; 95% CI, 1.5-10.3) were independent predictors of resistance to=
 _2 anti
  -TB agents. Resistance to _2 anti-TB drugs was the single independent pre=
dictor
  of treatment failure (OR=3D6.4; 95% CI, 2.3-17.8). 24 of 172 patients (14=
%) who
  denied having received prior anti-TB therapy were infected with resistant
  organisms, suggesting ongoing transmission of drug-resistant strains. Alt=
hough
  84% (69 of 82) of patients with fully susceptible organisms and 89% (17 o=
f 19)
  with singly resistant organisms were cured, only 45% of patients (10 of 2=
2)
  infected with organisms resistant to _2 agents were successfully treated.=
 It is
  concluded that at this sentinel site for complicated TB, a substantial su=
bset
  of cases who are infected with drug-resistant bacteria cannot be easily
  identified or treated.

AB: The contamination of human milk with organochlorine residues was assess=
ed
  and compared through 2 sentinel practice networks in Lower Saxony, a stat=
e of
  former West Germany, from July 1992 to June 1993, and Saxony-Anhalt, a st=
ate of
  former East Germany, from January to June 1995. Sociodemographic, lifesty=
le and
  exposure factors were determined by questionnaire in 156 primiparous, bre=
ast
  -feeding women from Lower Saxony and 113 from Saxony-Anhalt during a regu=
lar
  screening examination 4-6 weeks postpartum. Human milk samples were analy=
sed
  for hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), hexachlorbenzole (HCB), DDT, dieldrin,
  polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and heptachlorepoxid (HCE); half the samp=
les
  were also analysed for dioxin. Analytic statistics were computed using mu=
ltiple
  logistic regression. In Lower Saxony all but 2 human milk samples were we=
ll
  below the tolerable concentrations established by the German Research Cou=
ncil
  (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)). In Saxony-Anhalt no participant =
had
  concentrations above those recommended by the DFG. After adjustment for a=
ge of
  mother and child, occupational and non-occupational pesticide contact, DD=
T and
  beta-HCH concentrations were significantly lower in Lower Saxony and HCE =
and
  dieldrin concentrations were lower in Saxony-Anhalt. There were no differ=
ences
  between the 2 states for PCB, HCB, gamma-HCH and dioxin. Human milk
  contamination levels in former Saxony-Anhalt exceeded the contamination i=
n
  Lower Saxony only for DDT and beta-HCH.

  oothecae in control treeholes was 10-40%, but peaked at 46% the week of 7=

  Weekly winter (December-March) sentinel ootheca parasitism was <10%. Para=
sitism
  of sentinel oothecae in release treeholes remained higher for 10 of the 1=

AB: A tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) patient has not been reported for many =
years
  in Japan, although a serological survey of domestic animal sera suggested=
 the
  presence of TBE foci in Hokkaido. In October 1993 in Hokkaido, a severe
  encephalitis case in a farmer's wife was diagnosed as tick-borne encephal=
itis.
  Serological examination of paired sera showed a rise of neutralization an=
tibody
  titre to Russian spring summer encephalitis (RSSE) virus. A
  seroepizootiological survey of dogs in 1994 showed that the TBE-related v=
irus
  was prevalent in the area. Three virus isolates were obtained from the bl=
ood of
  sentinel dogs in 1995 and the antigenic analysis grouped the isolates int=
o TBE
  -related viruses. Sequence analysis of the envelope protein gene identifi=
ed one
  of the isolates as the same subtype as RSSE virus. The results provide ev=
idence
  that TBE is endemic in certain areas of Japan.

AB: The evidence for declines in the male proportion at birth and suspected
  causes for this decline were examined. Birth records were analysed from
  national statistical agencies and published analyses of trends in ratio o=
f
  males to females at birth and studies of sex determinants evaluating
  epidemiological and endocrinological factors were selected. The data incl=
uded
  proportion of males born: 1950-1994 in Denmark; 1950-1994 in the Netherla=
nds;
  1970-1990 in Canada; and 1970-1990 in the USA. Since 1950, significant de=
clines
  in the proportion of males born have been reported in Denmark and the
  Netherlands. Similar declines have been reported for Canada and the USA s=
ince
  1970 and parallel declines also have occurred in Sweden, Germany, Norway,=
 and
  Finland. In Denmark, the proportion of males declined from 0.515 in 1950 =
to
  0.513 in 1994. In the Netherlands, the proportion of males declined from =
0.516
  in 1950 to 0.513 in 1994. Similar declines in the proportion of males bor=
n in
  Canada and the United States are equivalent to a shift from male to femal=
e
  births of 8600 and 38 000 births, respectively. It was concluded that kno=
wn and
  hypothesized risk factors for reduced sex ratio at birth cannot fully acc=
ount
  for recent trends. Patterns of reduced sex ratio need to be carefully ass=
essed
  to determine whether they are occurring more generally, whether temporal =
or
  spatial variations are evident, and whether they constitute a sentinel he=
alth
  event.

AB: In 1984, a a system of prompt reporting of cases of childhood vaccine
  -preventable diseases, encephalitis, meningitis, hepatitis, and rabies,
  together with a sentinel laboratory surveillance of cholera, typhoid feve=
r,
  malaria, HIV infection and antimicrobial-resistance patterns of selected
  pathogens, was established in the North Arcot district (population 5 mill=
ion)
  of Tamil Nadu, India. The system combined government and private sectors,=
 with
  every hospital enrolled and participating. Reports were scanned daily on =
a
  computer for any clustering of cases. Interventions included investigatio=
ns,
  immunization, antimicrobial treatment, health education, and physical
  rehabilitation of children with paralysis. By 1995, all vaccine-preventab=
le
  diseases (acute flaccid paralysis, measles, pertussis and tetanus) had de=
clined
  markedly, whilst malaria and HIV infections increased steadily. Annual ex=
pense
  was <1 US cent per head. It is suggested that the reasons for the success=
 and
  sustainability of this model include simplicity of reporting procedure, l=
ow
  budget, private-sector participation, personal rapport with people in the
  network, regular feedback of information through a monthly bulletin, and =
the
  visible interventions consequent upon reporting. This district-level dise=
ase
  surveillance model is replicable in developing countries for evaluating p=
olio
  eradication efforts, monitoring immunization programmes, detecting outbre=
aks of
  old or new diseases, and for evaluating control measures.

  random cluster sampling (n =3D 4195). The survey was carried out in catch=
ment
  populations of clinics used for national HIV surveillance. The methodolog=
y
  allows detailed comparisons of HIV infection patterns to be made in two a=
reas
  (urban and rural). Surveillance of antenatal clinic attenders (ANC) tende=
d to
  underestimate the overall HIV prevalence of the general population, but
  differences were not statistically significant. In the urban area, the ad=
justed
  overall HIV prevalence rate of ANC (aged 15-39 years) was 24.4% [95% conf=
idence
  interval (CI), 20.9-28.0] compared with 26.0% (95% CI, 23.4-28.6) in the
  general population. The respective rural estimates were 12.5% (95% CI, 9.=
3
  -15.6) versus 16.4% (95% CI, 12.1-20.6). Age-specific prevalence rates sh=
owed
  ANC to overestimate infection in teenagers (aged 15-19 years), whereas in=
 the
  reverse direction of those aged _ 30 years. Teenagers analysed by single =
year
  of age revealed both ANC and women in the general population with about t=
he
  same steep increase in prevalence by age, but the former at consistently =
higher
  rates. Extrapolations might be biased substantially due to the higher pre=
gnancy
  rates amongst uninfected individuals.

  (acetone), insecticide-impregnated (0.1% deltamethrin) targets was conduc=
ted in
  a 300 km2 area in the Eastern Province of Zambia, that is highly cultivat=
ed and
  with a cattle density of about 8 cattle/km2, between 1989 and 1991. Targe=
ts
  were deployed in suitable tsetse habitats along roads and tracks. The eff=
ect of
  the targets on the tsetse population and on the transmission of tsetse
  -transmitted trypanosomiases was monitored by means of man-walked fly rou=
nds
  and sentinel herds, respectively. The apparent density of tsetse in the t=
rial
  area and in adjacent areas, declined rapidly after targets had been deplo=
yed.
  Trypanosomiasis incidence in the trial area decreased significantly but d=
id not
  completely disappear. It is concluded that odour-baited targets are effec=
tive
  in controlling Glossina m. morsitans in highly cultivated areas even when
  deployment is restricted to suitable tsetse habitat. It is suggested that
  tsetse control operations should be designed so that either the invasion
  pressure is low from adjacent areas, or the size of the area is large for=
 a
  central challenge-free area can be created.

AB: A case of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) has not been reported for many =
years
  in Japan, although a serological survey of sera from cattle conducted in =
1978
  suggested the presence of TBE foci in Hokkaido. Studies were conducted to=
 prove
  the presence of an endemic focus of TBE virus in Japan by means of serolo=
gy and
  virus isolation. In October 1993 in Kamiiso, Hokkaido, a severe case of
  encephalitis in a dairy farmer's wife was diagnosed as TBE. Serological
  examination of paired serum specimens showed a rise in the neutralization
  antibody titre to Russian spring summer encephalitis virus. A
  seroepizootiological survey of dogs showed that the TBE-related virus was
  prevalent in the area. Three virus isolates were obtained from the blood =
of
  sentinel dogs, and antigenic analysis grouped the isolates into TBE-relat=
ed
  viruses. Sequence analysis of the envelope protein gene identified one of=
 the
  isolates as being of the same subtype as the Russian spring summer enceph=
alitis
  (Far Eastern TBE) virus. The results provide evidence that TBE is endemic=
 in
  Hokkaido. The EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ accession number for the new nucleotide
  sequence is AB001026.

AB: The early induction of interleukin (IL)-12 is a critical event in
  determining the development of both innate resistance and adaptive immuni=
ty to
  many intracellular pathogens. Previous in vitro studies have suggested th=
at the
  macrophage (MPHI) is a major source of the initial IL-12 produced upon
  microbial stimulation and that this response promotes the differentiation=
 of
  protective T helper cell 1 (Th1) CD4+ lymphocytes from precursors that ar=
e
  primed on antigen-bearing dendritic cells (DC). Immunolocalization experi=
ments
  and flow cytometric analysis were used to show that, contrary to expectat=
ion,
  DC and not MPHI are the initial cells to synthesize IL-12 in the spleens =
of
  mice exposed in vivo to an extract of Toxoplasma gondii or to
  lipopolysaccharide, 2 well characterized microbial stimulants of this cyt=
okine.
  This production of IL-12 occurs very rapidly and is independent of interf=
eron
  -gamma priming or of signals from T cells, such as CD40 ligand. IL-12
  production by splenic DC is accompanied by an increase in number of DCs, =
as
  well as a redistribution to the T cell areas and the acquisition of marke=
rs
  characteristic of interdigitating dendritic cells. The capacity of spleni=
c DC
  but not MPHI to synthesize de novo high levels of IL-12 within hours of
  exposure to microbial products in vivo, as well as the ability of the sam=
e
  stimuli to induce migration of DC to the T cell areas, argues that DC fun=
ction
  simultaneously as both antigen-presenting cells and IL-12 producing acces=
sory
  cells in the initiation of cell-mediated immunity to intracellular pathog=
ens.
  This model avoids the need to invoke a 3-cell interaction for Th1
  differentiation and points to the DC as both a sentinel for innate recogn=
ition
  and the dictator of class selection in the subsequent adaptive response.

AB: In Pakistan, the spread of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum =
has
  been recorded by in vivo surveys carried out each year since 1977. Survey=
s
  conducted during the last decade show that P. falciparum malaria has beco=
me
  resistant to chloroquine in Pakistani and Afghan refugee populations thro=
ughout
  the country. Although RI resistance is common everywhere (with a frequenc=
y of
  30-84%), RII is less common (2-36%), and RIII resistance has yet to be
  detected. A repeated in-vivo survey in a sentinel village indicated that
  prescription of chloroquine could lead to a 15% increase in the frequency=
 of
  resistance in a single year, and similar trends were observed in other
  districts. Coinciding with the spread of resistance was a 6-fold increase=
 in
  the number of P. falciparum cases recorded nationally between 1982 and 19=
92,
  and a parallel, 5-fold increase in the number of cases recorded in the Af=
ghan
  refugee population. In the sentinel village, where resistance was measure=
d at
  71%, recrudescent infections increased the genuine incidence of new infec=
tions
  recorded at the health centre by 66%. It is suggested that ineffective
  treatment could lead to resistant infections remaining patent during the =
post
  -transmission season. There was evidence that the vector-control programm=
e
  among the refugees was still able to reduce the incidence of P. falciparu=
m
  malaria to a level that existed before the advent of resistance.

AB: Data from a sentinel network of general practitioners in Belgium, which

nce of
  both diseases. In 1994-95, measles incidence in the Flemish Region was
  comparable with the level in 1991-93 (87/100 000 inhabitants). In the Wal=
loon
  Region the incidence was significantly higher in 1994-95 (177/100 000
  inhabitants) compared with 1991-93 and compared with the incidence in the
  Flemish Region in 1994-95. The proportion of cases in children aged _10 y=
ears
  increased significantly over time in both regions. Complications were not=
ified
  in 19% of the cases; pneumonia was the most commonly reported type of
  complication (43%). In 1994-95, the incidence of mumps in the Flemish Reg=
ion
  (49/100 000 inhabitants) was significantly lower than in 1991-93. The inc=
idence
  of mumps in the Walloon Region in 1994-95 (207/100 000 inhabitants) was
  comparable with the incidence in 1991-93, but was significantly higher th=
an in
  the Flemish Region. As for measles, the proportion of cases in children a=
ged
  _10 years increased significantly over time in both regions. It is conclu=
ded
  that the sentinel network of GPs is still a useful tool for monitoring ch=
anges

  sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in Switzerland. STD surveillance dat=
a from
  three sources are presented: reports from six policlinics of dermatovener=
eology
  since 1973, laboratory reports of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Treponema pallid=
um and
  Chlamydia trachomatis since 1988, and reports by the Swiss Sentinel Netwo=
rk
  between June 1991 and December 1993. The data indicate that there has bee=
n a
  decline in the number of cases of syphilis and, in particular, gonorrhoea=
 since
  the early 1980s in Switzerland. Since many factors could explain the decl=
ines
  (e.g. more effective treatments, more widespread use of antibiotics, mark=
ed
  changes in behaviour such as increased levels of condom use) it is diffic=
ult to
  identify their exact causes. Evidence for two of the before-mentioned fac=
tors
  exists and these probably played important roles in the declines: firstly=
, as a
  result of the emergence of penicillinase producing strains of N. gonorrho=
eae,
  the introduction of new treatments for gonorrhoea in the early 1980s whic=
h were
  simpler to administer and more effective (in particular the use of
  spectinomycin); secondly, the national AIDS prevention campaign which beg=
an in
  1987 and has been associated with major increases in condom use in the Sw=
iss
  population.

  of June 30, 1996, the cumulative number of AIDS cases reported to the Wor=

  prevalence of HIV antibodies has remained at less than 1% in target

  diagnosed tuberculosis, blood donors, and patients presenting sexually

  remained low, with the weekly consultation rate for new episodes of influ=
enza
  and flu-like illness with general practitioners in the Royal College of G=
eneral
  Practitioners sentinel scheme rising above the baseline level of activity=
 (<50
  per 100 000 population) for the first time in week 6 of 1998 (week ending=
 8
  February). During weeks 7, 8, and 9 rates were 50-100 per 100 000, repres=
enting
  normal seasonal levels of activity. The numbers of laboratory reports of
  influenza in England and Wales to the Public Health Laboratory Service (P=
HLS)
  began to increase in early February 1998. Influenza A virus subtype H1N1
  strains predominated at the beginning of the winter, but increasing numbe=
rs of
  subtype H3N2 strains were noted up to time of reporting in early March. H=
1N1
  strains were similar to the A/Bayern/7/95-like strain included in the 199=
7/98
  vaccine, while H3N2 strains were similar to either the A/Wuhan/359/95-lik=
e
  strain (included in the 1997/98 vaccine) or to the A/Sydney/5/97-like str=
ain.
  Outbreaks of influenza A/Sydney/5/97 infection were reported from schools=

AB: The prevalence and epidemiology of penicillinase producing Neisseria
  gonorrhoeae (PPNG) and tetracycline resistant N. gonorrhoeae (TRNG) was
  examined during 1977-95 in the Netherlands. Auxotypes, serovars and
  antibiograms of PPNG, non-PPNG and TRNG were compared and determinants in
  patient characteristics for the epidemic spread of TRNG/PPNG were investi=
gated.
  All PPNG isolates from 30 laboratories over the country in 1977-90 and al=
l
  gonococcal isolates from 5 sentinel laboratories (during 1 month per quar=
ter)
  in 1991-5 were collected. Additional data on PPNG infected individuals we=
re
  collected retrospectively during a micro-epidemic of TRNG/PPNG. Univariat=
e and
  multivariate analyses were performed to identify risk factors for TRNG/PP=
NG
  infections. In 1995 an overall high prevalence of PPNG infection (27%) am=
ongst
  total gonorrhoea infection and TRNG among PPNG infection (24%) was found =
in the
  Netherlands. PPNG had higher MICs for ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin than =
non
  -PPNG; clinically relevant resistance to these antibiotics (or related ag=
ents)
  may emerge first among these strains. The observed diversity of strains (=
123
  auxo/serovar classes since 1988) indicates a continuous introduction of n=
ew
  strains into the community. The epidemic increase of TRNG/PPNG was mainly
  caused by A/S classes NR/1B-6, PRO/1A-3, and PRO/1A-6, suggesting a clona=
l
  spread of a few strains; the rapid spread was associated with transmissio=
n in
  high risk individuals. It was concluded that the prevalence of PPNG in th=
e
  Netherlands remains high and reduced sensitivity to other antimicrobials =
was
  detected among the PPNG strains. This study underlines the necessity for =
a
  continuous national surveillance of resistance in gonococci including lim=
ited
  epidemiological information.

  physicians were interviewed, and the medical record was reviewed. A telep=
hone
  survey of 103 (17%) of the 609 licensed obstetrician/gynaecologists pract=
icing
  in Tennessee was then conducted to assess the practice of determining a
  patient's vaccination history during prenatal care. The mother was a 30-y=

  stay in February 1995 were uncomplicated. On the 6th day of life, the inf=

status

AB: In the early summer of 1993, an outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) was
  reported among both humans and animals in Aswan Governorate, Upper Egypt.=
 To
  determine whether RVF infection had spread to the Nile delta region of th=
e
  country, the authors carried out a cross-sectional survey of 1181
  occupationally exposed abattoir workers (97% males; age range 10-72 years=
) in
  15 governorates of Egypt in November 1993. The overall prevalence of anti=
-RVF
  virus IgM antibody was 2% (range: 0% (7 governorates) to 10%). The highes=
t
  prevalences were in Ismailia (10%) and Sharqiya (8%) Governorates. None o=
f the
  seropositive subjects reported having experienced an episode of fever in =
the 2
  months prior to the study. The prevalence of antibody was significantly h=
igher
  (P<0.05) among workers employed in high-risk jobs such as cutting animals=
'
  throats (relative risk (RR =3D 2.24)) and handling animal parts (RR =3D 2=
.37). The
  findings suggest that abattoir workers represent a useful sentinel popula=
tion
  for surveillance of RVF.

AB: Patients from a surveillance study of acute viral hepatitis in 4 counti=
es in
  the USA who had acute hepatitis during 1985-86 or 1991-95 were studied. S=
erum
  samples were tested for hepatitis G virus (HGV, also named GB virus C) RN=
A by
  the polymerase chain reaction. HGV RNA was detected in 4 of 45 patients w=
ith a
  diagnosis of non-A-E hepatitis (9%), 23 of 116 patients with hepatitis C =
(20%),
  25 of 100 patients with hepatitis A (25%) and 32 of 100 patients with hep=
atitis
  B (32%) (P<0.05 for the comparison of hepatitis B with hepatitis non-A-E =
or C).
  The clinical characteristics of the acute illness were similar for patien=
ts
  with HGV alone and those with hepatitis A, B, or C with or without HGV
  infection. During a follow-up period of 1-9 years, chronic hepatitis did =
not
  develop in any of the patients with HGV alone, but 75% were persistently
  positive for HGV RNA, as were 87% of those with both hepatitis C and HGV
  infection. The rates of chronic hepatitis were similar in patients with
  hepatitis C alone (60%) and those with both hepatitis C and HGV infection
  (61%). It is concluded that the evidence from this surveillance study doe=
s not
  implicate HGV as an aetiological agent of non-A-E hepatitis. Persistent
  infection with HGV was common, but it did not lead to chronic disease and=
 did
  not affect the clinical course in patients with hepatitis A, B, or C.

  tested for haemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies and positive sera were
  further screened, using the plaque reduction neutralisation test. Of 2255
  samples, 259 (11.5%) had haemagglutination-inhibiting and neutralising
  antibodies, as follows: pigs (0%), sheep (18.7%), goats (10.4%), cattle
  (10.2%), horses (9.8%) and dromedaries (3.3%). The highest prevalence of =
RVFV
  antibody was found in the plateau area (18.4%). Animals aged 3 years or m=

  had a higher prevalence of antibodies to RVFV. Longitudinal studies showe=

  seroconversion to RVFV in 10 of 210 animals which were kept under observa=
tion
  (4.8%). All seroconversions occurred during the wet season. The results o=
f this
  study indicate that the infection of animals with RVFV is widespread in N=

AB: Since 1992, efforts have been made to combat onchocerciasis in Guatemal=
a
  through mass distribution of ivermectin. The impact of the campaign is as=
sessed
  by taking skin-snips from sentinel groups within selected communities. Th=
is
  method gives an estimate of the prevalence and intensity of infection, an=
d thus
  the efficacy of the treatment. In some communities people are becoming
  reluctant to volunteer for skin-snipping, and so there is a need for an
  alternative technique that will give quantitative results. In most hypere=
ndemic
  communities in Guatemala, biting blackflies are so ubiquitous that few pe=
ople
  object to allowing 10 to 20 flies to engorge upon them. Data on the
  quantitative uptake of Onchocerca volvulus microfilariae by Simulium ochr=
aceum
  were examined before and after ivermectin distribution to see whether res=
ults
  similar to skin-snip data could be obtained. Counts of microfilariae inge=
sted
  by S. ochraceum were compared to the numbers found in skin-snips from the=
 same
  volunteers. In a group of 31 untreated infected persons, a skin-snip surv=
ey was
  positive in 20 (64.5%), whereas feeding flies (vector microfilarial uptak=
e,
  VmfU) was positive in 30 (96.8%). Post-treatment, in a sample of 58 of wh=
om 52
  (89.7%) had a history of infection, both skin-snips and VmfU were positiv=
e in
  31 (54.2%). Vector blood meals contained more microfilariae than did one =
mg of
  skin before treatment, but both recorded about equal numbers after treatm=
ent.
  When the data set was subdivided to compare samples taken at 2-3, 6-8 and=
 14-17
  months post-treatment, the effect of ivermectin was still apparent at 6-8
  months, but had virtually disappeared by 14 months post-treatment. The fl=
ies
  ingested fewer microfilariae from treated persons than was expected from =
the
  skin densities estimated by skin-snip. This effect lasted for over 8 mont=
hs,
  and it is suggested that it may indicate that ivermectin has a greater ef=
fect
  on transmission than previously suspected. It is concluded that VmfU coul=
d be
  used as an alternative to skin-snipping; the ethical implications are dis=
cussed.

  increasing quantity of disease surveillance data to validate estimates an=

e and
  sex and among sentinel groups for which data are available. This approach
  permits a closer relationship between forecasting and surveillance activi=
ties,
  and more accurate estimates validated to data. As inputs the model uses a=
n
  estimate of the HIV prevalence, country demographic data, and a profile o=
f the
  sexual risk of HIV infection by age, to project HIV incidence, prevalence=
,
  number of AIDS cases and population. The following examples of the use of=
 the
  model are given: forecasting HIV incidence in East Africa, by age, sex, a=

  among pregnant women; 3 to 5-year forecasts of HIV incidence; modelling m=

  England and Wales began to increase towards the end of November and peake=

  respiratory syncytial virus activity, but also peaked in early January.
  Influenza A(H3N2) viruses were first detected in early October, but rarel=

  until November, and activity peaked in early January, coinciding with the=
 peak
  in consultations for flu-like illness. A few influenza B viruses were det=
ected
  in late November and early December, and substantial activity was recorde=
d in
  mid-January. Approximately equal numbers of influenza A(H3N2) and B virus=
es
  were identified over the winter as a whole, and circulating strains were
  antigenically similar to those included in the vaccine for 1996/97. Altho=
ugh
  influenza activity was "moderate" in terms of consultations and laborator=

AB: The magnitude and causality structure of infant mortality (considered a

es of
  Northeastern Brazil were examined in a population based study comparing
  observed infant mortality with that expected, given a properly functionin=

  "preventable index" (PDI) for these 2 municipalities. The preliminary ste=
p
  consisted of an active search and epidemiological investigation of deaths=
 in
  order to eliminate their underreporting as events. Infant mortality rates=
 in
  the 2 areas were relatively low (39 and 44 per 1000 live births, respecti=
vely)
  but PDI in both was in the order of 40%, indicating a causality structure
  compatible with mortality rates of 100 per 1000. These results indicate a=

low
  income population with that of other income brackets (with risk ratios of=
 8 and
  17.6 for total infant mortality and infant mortality from infectious dise=

AB: Preliminary findings on the ecology of the Phlebotominae in an area of
  coconut plantation ('municipalities' of Jitauna and Itagi) in the south o=
f the
  State of Bahia, Brazil, are presented. The study site had 60 well separat=

ng
  them, 41.5% were Montenegro positive; 37.5% from these had scars of heale=
d
  ulcers and 8.8% had active ulcers. 53% of the houses had dogs, of which 2=
2%
  were seropositive for Leishmania. Of the 7 dogs with ulcers, only 3 were
  seropositive. 14% of the inspected houses harboured sandflies inside them=
.
  During 2 years of observations, 72 sentinel hamsters were maintained in h=
ouses
  of patients with leishmaniasis ulcers, but they did not get the infection=
.
  During 2 years of observation (in 1991-92), monthly collections of sandfl=
ies
  were made inside houses, chicken pens, corrals, on tree trunks and in an =
open
  field around the house of a patient with leishmaniasis. A total of 5614
  specimens belonging to 14 different species of sandflies was identified. =
Among
  them, Lutzomyia whitmani (92%) and L. intermedia (4.8%) were the most abu=
ndant
  species. They are very anthropophilic and can be found inside houses and =
at
  peridomestic sites. Probably they are the principal vectors of Leishmania=
 in
  domestic sites. The other 12 species were less frequent and more often fo=
und in
  sylvatic places, although many also bite man. Generally, the biting activ=
ity of
  most of the species of the area begins at 17.00 h, at dusk, and reaches i=
ts
  peak at 00.00 h, when it begins declining until it disappears at 07.00.
  Lutzomyia whitmani was collected with similar densities in all lunar phas=
es,
  while L. intermedia was more abundant during the new moon phase.

AB: In the early summer of 1993, an outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) was
  reported among both humans and animals in Aswan Governorate, Upper Egypt.=
 To
  determine whether RVF infection had spread to the Nile delta region of th=
e
  country, the authors carried out a cross-sectional survey of 1181
  occupationally exposed abattoir workers (97% males; age range 10-72 years=
) in
  15 governorates of Egypt in November 1993. The overall prevalence of anti=
-RVF
  virus IgM antibody was 2% (range: 0% (7 governorates) to 10%). The highes=
t
  prevalences were in Ismailia (10%) and Sharqiya (8%) Governorates. None o=
f the
  seropositive subjects reported having experienced an episode of fever in =
the 2
  months prior to the study. The prevalence of antibody was significantly h=
igher
  (P<0.05) among workers employed in high-risk jobs such as cutting animals=
'
  throats (relative risk (RR =3D 2.24)) and handling animal parts (RR =3D 2=
.37). The
  findings suggest that abattoir workers represent a useful sentinel popula=
tion
  for surveillance of RVF.

AB: The status of research on gammadelta T cells is reviewed. Recent resear=
ch
  shows that gammadelta T cells may perceive antigens in an immunoglobulin-=
like
  manner and that non-peptidic substance can be antigens for these cells.
  Considerable advances have been made in defining the immunobiology of
  gammadelta T cells, with evidence for sentinel, protective and immunoregu=
latory
  roles. Research on gammadelta T cells in malaria infections suggests that
  gammadelta T cells are mediators of protective immunity, most probably th=
rough
  the production of Th1 cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alph=
a, TNF
  -delta and interferon-gamma and that excessive production of such cytokin=
es may
  contribute to pathology. Data on features of the peripheral blood gammade=
lta T
  cell response in humans infected with Plasmodium falciparum show that the=
re is
  considerable variation between individuals in the relative expansion of
  gammadelta T lymphocytes following primary or secondary infection, confir=
m that
  activation of gammadelta T cells occurs during P. falciparum infection, a=
nd
  show that activated cells can persist for many weeks after treatment. The
  possibility that gammadelta T cells have an immunoregulatory function in
  malaria infections is proposed.

TI: Sentinel surveillance of Chlamydia trachomatis infection in women
  terminating pregnancy.

AB: The aim was to evaluate demographic characteristics of women terminatin=
g
  their pregnancy for sentinel surveillance of Chlamydia trachomatis infect=
ion
  and to report changing prevalences of C. trachomatis over time within thi=
s
  study population. Screening for C. trachomatis in women seeking induced
  abortion was introduced in 1984 at the Department of Gynecology, Regional
  Hospital Trondheim, Norway. Over the study years the department used a pr=
ecoded
  medical record covering sociodemographic, medically relevant data, also
  recording outcome of the C. trachomatis test. Throughout the study the
  Department of Microbiology applied cell culture, enzyme immunoassay, and,
  during the most recent years a nucleic acid test to identify C. trachomat=
is.
  Chi square test for linear trend and unconditional logistic regression. O=
ver
  the study period, women having induced abortion were characterized by bei=
ng
  most often single and more often at younger age. The overall age-adjusted
  prevalence of C. trachomatis declined from 9.2% in 1985 to 3.6% in 1995, =
the
  major decline occurring from 1987 to 1991, and affected all age-groups
  simultaneously. There was a 60% decrease in odds ratio of having a C.
  trachomatis infection from 1985 to 1991, and the crude and the adjusted o=
dds
  ratios did not differ for any year examined. It is concluded that women
  deciding on pregnancy termination have demographic characteristics that
  identify high-risk groups for C. trachomatis infection. Despite these
  characteristics, which were relatively constant over the study period, th=
e
  study population changed from being a high- to a low-prevalence populatio=
n of
  C. trachomatis.

tis
  and latent syphilis among women. The overall HIV prevalence was 5%, with =
large
  differences in rates in people from different continents. Very high HIV
  -positivity rates were observed among homosexuals and homosexual IDUs fro=
m
  Central-South America, with 39.1% and 77.8% seropositive individuals
  respectively. These data stress the need for increased knowledge of both =
the

  should be paid to counselling procedures focused on the prevention of ris=

 PHLS
  Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre in the UK, showed that the incid=
ence
  of mumps has fallen to very low levels since vaccination against measles,=
 mumps
  and rubella was introduced in 1988. Hospital admissions for mumps showed =
a 92%
  decline compared with the prevaccination era, to a rate of 0.2 per 100 00=
0
  population per year. Serological surveillance showed an increase in the
  proportion of school age children with no detectable antibody to mumps, w=
hich
  is consistent with the reduction in mumps virus transmission. The proport=
ion of
  children aged 11-15 years with no detectable antibody is expected to peak=
 at
  19% in 1997. Mathematical models suggested that this increase in suscepti=
bility
  is unlikely to allow a large resurgence of mumps in the short term but th=
at
  school outbreaks may become more common. Outbreaks in universities and mi=
litary
  establishments are possible in the medium term. Analysis of efficacy data=
 for
  mumps vaccine indicated that mumps was unlikely to be eliminated with a s=
ingle
  dose of vaccine at current coverage rates. A second dose of vaccine, bein=
g
  offered to preschool children, will reduce morbidity and should eventuall=
y
  eliminate mumps if coverage is high enough.

d
  injections 24-48 h before paralysis and suffered from aggravation polio. =
The
  pattern and severity of paralysis reflected the site of injection. After
  paralysis children had been taken to many doctors, clinics, hospitals and
  healers. The gender ratio of boys to girls was very high, 1.7:1.0 at this
  clinic and 2.3:1.0 at a sentinel hospital for acute cases. It is conclude=
d that
  unnecessary injections are the cause of much paralysis in Pakistan.

AB: Between 7 October 1994 and 7 February 1995 cross-sectional serological
  surveys using an unlinked anonymous HIV screening method were performed i=
n 4
  antenatal clinics in 4 urban centres located in the centre, the north, th=
e east
  and the south-west of the country. In the towns included in the study mor=
e than
  94% of pregnant women attend at least 2 antenatal consultations. In each =
centre
  all pregnant women attending an antenatal consultation during a 2-week pe=
riod
  were invited to take part in a study to measure the prevalence of syphili=
s.
  Women with positive syphilis serology were offered treatment free of char=
ge. A
  total of 1294 pregnant women were recruited into the study. There were no
  refusals. Thirty two women (2.5%) had positive syphilis serology. The ove=
rall
  seroprevalence of HIV infection was 8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.6=
-9.6).
  There was no evidence that the prevalence of syphilis or HIV infection va=
ried
  between the 4 towns (P=3D0.12 and 0.52, respectively). In logistic regres=
sion
  analyses only the presence of syphilis infection was associated with risk=
 of
  HIV (odds ratio=3D3.4; 95% CI: 1.4-7.9). The prevalence of syphilis among
  pregnant women in Burkina Faso is therefore relatively low compared with =
that
  of HIV infection. These results suggest that the HIV epidemic in Burkina =
Faso
  is important and that there is an urgent need to intensify HIV-prevention
  activities. HIV surveillance in this sentinel population is also urgently
  needed to follow the course of the epidemic and to measure the impact of
  interventions. One of the consequences of the high prevalence of HIV infe=
ction
  among pregnant women which requires greater attention in Burkina Faso is =
the
  increasing number of children who will be infected with HIV by vertical
  transmission.

  animals for Lyme borreliosis in summer 1995 in Friesland, Flevoland and
  Limburg, The Netherlands. Serum was obtained from 114 roe deer, and 513 I=

  ricinus, predominantly females (72%), were obtained from 47 animals (41%)=

  polymerase chain reaction was used to detect DNA of B. burgdorferi s.l. i=
n a
  total of 190 ticks, comprising 106 engorged ticks and 84 non-engorged tic=
ks.
  Borrelia DNA was detected in 24 engorged ticks (23%) and 26 non-engorged =
ticks
  (31%). This difference was not significant (P =3D 0.25). Four species of =
B.
  burgdorferi s.l. were identified in the ticks: B. burgdorferi s.s., B. ga=
rinii,
  B. afzelii and group VS116. B. afzelii was most commonly found and presen=
t in
  13 mixed infections, and in 28 single infections. 15 sera (13%) contained
  antibodies to Borrelia spp. Ticks are more appropriate sentinel animals f=
or
  Lyme borreliosis than roe deer, an important host for I. ricinus. Althoug=
h the
  viability of Borrelia spirochaetes in engorged ticks collected from roe d=

  was not assessed, a bloodmeal taken from roe deer did not eliminate Borre=

  spirochaetes from the tick. The relevance of this finding for transovaria=

  virus (BLU) infection in Indonesia. BLU was isolated from Culicoides fulv=
us, C.
  orientalis (in a pooled sample with C. fulvus), C. peregrinus and Anophel=
es
  spp. collected near sentinel sites, and from the blood of the sentinel ca=
ttle.
  Serological results indicated that seroconversion mostly occurred at the =
end of
  the wet season and that large ruminants had a higher prevalence of antibo=
dy
  than small ruminants. BLU serotypes 1, 3, 7, 9, 12, 16, 21 and 23 were
  successfully isolated from blood from apparently healthy cattle. The
  pathogenicity of BLU isolates was determined in local and imported sheep.

n
  ELISA using synthetic nonapeptide (R1) and cultured Plasmodium falciparum=

  Serological studies of a population of 143 children aged 0 to 5 years sho=
wed
  that antibody titres during the non-transmission season were low and show=
ed
  correlated with the annual parasite index (API). The API determined from =
the
  previous year's sample collection gave an estimate of the annual malaria
  exposure and corresponded with the ELISA O.D. value for the following yea=
r's
  non-transmission season. Both antigens showed a decline in antibody titre=
 in a
  sentinel population of 186 children during the non-transmission season, w=

  were followed for 1 month after identification of sentinel Shigella patie=
nts in
  their neighbourhoods. 219 (12%) children developed Shigella diarrhoea
  (shigellosis) and 227 (13%) developed culture-negative dysentery. Shigell=
a
  flexneri (60%) and S. dysenteriae, type 1 (15%) were the most common isol=
ates
  among shigellosis cases. Within individual neighbourhoods, there was poor
  agreement (Kappa =3D 0.21) between Shigella species isolated from sentine=
l
  patients and from additional cases detected during surveillance. The risk=
 of
  shigellosis increased substantially after infancy and peaked in the secon=
d year
  of life. Severe stunting, as assessed by height-for-age, was associated w=
ith an
  increased risk of shigellosis (adjusted odds ratio [ORa] =3D 1.67, 95% co=
nfidence
  interval [CI] =3D 1.09-2.57, P <0.05), while breast-feeding was protectiv=
ely
  associated (ORa =3D 0.40, 95% CI =3D 0.24-0.69, P <0.001). Only 43% of th=
e
  shigellosis cases reported bloody stools; frank dysentery occurred more
  frequently in S. dysenteriae 1 infections than in S. flexneri infections =
(ORa =3D
  5.04, 95% CI =3D 1.76-14.48, P <0.01), and was also associated with sever=
e
  stunting (ORa =3D 2.16, 95% CI =3D 1.01-4.58, P <0.05). These findings sh=
ow that
  the high risk of shigellosis in residentially exposed Bangladeshi childre=

  results from multiple Shigella strains circulating concurrently within th=

  infecting species and with host nutritional status.

  additional data regarding number of tests performed and number of people

sh,
  India. Both crude Plasmodium falciparum antigen (Pf) and synthetic nonape=
ptide
  (RI) were used in the ELISA. Both antigens responded equally well but the

  easy availability. The population of Mandla, who had been protected by ve=

  infection in humans, cattle, buffaloes and other domestic animals, and
  Oncomelania snails, in 2 villages in China are presented. Chuanxing villa=
ge is
  located in a plateau basin in Sichuan Province, and Zhonghe village is lo=
cated
  in a plateau canyon in Yunnan province. In Zhonghe the relative importanc=
e of
  the various hosts in schistosomiasis transmission were 32.8% for humans, =
60.9%
  for cattle and buffaloes and 6.3% for other domestic animals. In Chuanxin=
g the
  corresponding figures were 88.2, 11.6 and 0.2%. In Zhonghe, of the areas
  harbouring Oncomelania snails, 93.3% were rice fields, 3% were canals and=
 3.7%
  were other types of water body. Of the areas with infected Oncomelania, 9=
6.1%
  were rice fields, 3.1% were canals and 0.8% were other water bodies. In
  Chuanxing, of all the areas found to have Oncomelania snails 17.9% were r=
ice
  fields, 61.8% were canals and 20.3% were other types of water body. Rates=
 of
  infection of Oncomelania were 1.4 and 0.1% for rice fields, 0.6 and 0.16%=
 for
  canals and 0.9 and 0% for vegetable fields, respectively, in Zhonghe and
  Chuanxing. Rates of infection in sentinel mice placed in rice fields, can=
als
  and vegetable fields were 8.9, 13.6 and 23.3%, respectively, in Zhonghe, =
and
  2.9, 24.3 and 0%, respectively, in Chuanxing. It is concluded that transm=
ission
  of schistosomiasis in the 2 areas was significantly different and that co=

  the CHP, with the remaining deglycosylated PSC (DGP) and with dead PSC (D=
PSC)
  to analyse the relative immunogenicity of carbohydrates on the surface of=
 PSC.
  A 4th sentinel group was not immunized. The antibody response was analyse=
d
  during primary and hyperimmune responses. Specific antibody titres (IgG a=
nd
  IgM) against somatic PSC antigens (PSA) were evaluated by ELISA and their
  antigen recognition pattern by immunoblotting, discriminating carbohydrat=
e- and
  peptide-specific antibody responses by periodate treatment of PSA. The av=
idity
  index of those antibodies and the titre of non-specific immunoglobulins d=
uring
  the whole protocol were evaluated by ELISA. In vitro mitogenic activity o=
f CHP
  was also evaluated. The results indicated: immunodominance of surface
  carbohydrate epitopes from PSC; predominant IgM and low avidity response
  against these epitopes; a dramatic increase of non-specific antibody titr=
es; in
  vitro mitogenic activity of CHP.

AB: The usefulness of sentinel surveillance data on HIV-1 infection in
  estimating the magnitude of HIV-1 infection in the general population was
  assessed. Results from a population based study on HIV-1 infection in Buk=
oba,
  Tanzania, were compared with those from antenatal mothers and blood donor=
s, all
  from the same town. The studies were done during the period 1987-90. The
  overall HIV-1 prevalence was highest in the general population sample at =
24.2%
  followed by that in antenatal mothers at 22.4% and lowest in blood donors=
 at
  11.9%. Seroprevalence among antenatal clinic attenders was significantly =
lower
  than that of females from the general population sample (P=3D0.016). Prev=
alence
  among female blood donors did not differ significantly from that of femal=
es
  from the general population sample (P=3D0.06). Blood donor males had a lo=
wer HIV
  -1 seroprevalence when compared with those from the general population ma=
les
  (P=3D0.038). The age group 25-34 years had the highest prevalence of HIV-=
1
  infection in all the three populations indicating that this group is at t=
he
  highest risk of HIV infection and that the 3 populations show a similar t=
rend
  of age specific prevalence. It is concluded that female blood donors as a
  sentinel population represent more closely estimates of HIV-1 seroprevale=
nce of
  females in the general population than antenatal clinic attenders or male=
 blood
  donors. Further studies are proposed in different settings in order to pr=
ovide
  guidelines on the methodology of using sentinel surveillance populations =
in
  monitoring HIV-1 infection.

  Streptococcus pneumoniae (PNSP; MIC _0.1 =B5g/ml), 3.2% were penicillin-r=
esistant
  (MIC _2.0 =B5g/ml), and 25.5% were nonsusceptible to more than 1 antimicr=
obial
  agent. PNSP were more prevalent among children <6 years old (18.4%) than
  patients _18 years old (11.7%) and among white persons (16.2%) than black
  persons (12.1%). PNSP represented 15 serotypes, but 89% of PNSP were sero=
types
  in the 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine. The proportion of isolates with re=
duced
  susceptibility and the number of serotypes of nonsusceptible strains are
  increasing in the USA. Improved local surveillance for PNSP infections,
  judicious use of antibiotics, and development and use of effective pneumo=
coccal
  vaccines will be required to treat and prevent disease caused by these st=

AB: The 1995/96 season in the Netherlands was marked by an influenza A/H3N2
  epidemic that peaked in week 51. In this week, 39 patients with influenza=
-like
  illness per 10 000 inhabitants, contacted the sentinel physicians. With 2
  exceptions, influenza A/H3N2 viruses were exclusively isolated during the
  epidemic. In the first few months of 1996, a substantial number of influe=
nza
  A/H1N1 and influenza B viruses were isolated as well. Serological
  characterization of the circulating viruses revealed that they all resemb=
led
  the virus strains in the 1995/96 influenza vaccine, which will therefore
  probably have provided good protection. Based on the epidemiological data=
 from
  other countries and the fact that similar H3N2 viruses have been circulat=
ing
  since 1993, the World Health Organization has recommended that the H3N2
  component of the 1996/97 vaccine be exchanged for a Wuhan/353/95 (H3N2)-l=
ike
  strain.

. For
  SLE, the rates in counties that reported human SLE cases during a widespr=
ead
  epidemic in 1990 were compared with adjusted mean annual seroconversion r=
ates
  calculated by excluding the epidemic year seroconversion data. In general=
,
  actual rates were higher than adjusted rates in counties where human SLE =
cases
  were reported in 1990. Similar calculations were made for EEE virus that =
was
  unusually abundant in northern Florida during the spring and summer of 19=
91. In
  general, EEE virus was distributed in the panhandle and northern regions =
and
  SLE virus in the central and southern regions of the state. However, this
  distribution was not exclusive, and during years of high transmission, ei=
ther
  virus can extend beyond its normal range. The annual distribution of SLE =
and
  EEE viruses was sporadic, ranging from years with little detectable activ=
ity to
  years with widespread, high-level transmission.

e
  coordinated with the rapid laboratory processing of mosquito specimens fo=
r EEE
  virus. Active surveillance for EEE infections in humans and equines also =
was
  initiated. Results of long-term surveillance detected the presence of mul=
tiple
  Culiseta breeding swamps. A 6-year interepizootic period (1984-89) was fo=
llowed
  by 2 years of equine EEE. In 1990, there were 7 equine cases and a record
  number of EEE virus isolations from mosquitoes (C. melanura, C. morsitans=
,
  Aedes canadensis, A. vexans, Coquillettidia perturbans, Anopheles
  quadrimaculatus) (n =3D 86), wild birds (e.g. Melospiza melodia, Geothlyp=
is
  trichas, Dumetella carolinensis, Vireo olivaceus) (n =3D 27) and sentinel
  pheasants (n =3D 7). In 1991, seven equine cases also occurred, although =
there
  were fewer isolations from mosquitoes (n =3D 40). The sequence to the app=
earance
  of EEE virus at swamp and upland sites and at individual swamp complexes,=
 and
  the spatial and temporal distribution of equine cases, provide evidence f=
or
  multiple foci of EEE virus in central New York. The role of infected Culi=
seta
  melanura in the transfer of EEE virus between swamp and upland areas and =
among

AB: This paper presents evidence supporting the view that in the past natur=
al
  fungal poisons (mycotoxins) in mouldy grain strongly influenced variation=
s in
  fertility and mortality rates. The poisons that influenced fertility may =
have
  reduced conceptions and increased spontaneous abortions. Those that influ=
enced
  mortality may have damaged the immune system. In particular, tuberculosis=
, the
  most common cause of death, may have been a sentinel disease for immune s=
ystem
  damage by mycotoxins. It is unlikely that any one formula (specifying the
  amounts of each predictor variable) will be found that can predict fertil=
ity
  and mortality over wide areas or long time periods. However, by using jus=
t 3
  kinds of variables - climatic, dietetic and economic - it may be possible=
 to
  predict more than half of the variation in fertility and tuberculosis mor=
tality
  up to 1900 in Europe and America. The evidence presented supports the vie=
w that
  the 2 principal factors influencing natural population increase in Connec=

  over the subsequent 3 weeks. When 2 releases of 100 000 parasitized hosts=

 weeks

  the 3 releases. Parasite emergence from naturally occurring stable fly
  (Stomoxys calcitrans) and house fly puparia averaged 15.5% and 37.2%,
  respectively, collected during the 3-week period after each release, and =
little
  recycling was evident. Muscidifurax raptorellus is gregarious and aggress=

 in
  pesticide-exposed workers. By contrast, immunologically mediated systemic
  reactions have been described only as debatable case reports. The associa=
tion
  between autoimmune diseases and pesticide exposure has more recently been
  suggested. Despite the lack of convincing human data, a potential risk fo=
r the
  immune system should not be excluded, especially during chronic exposure =
to
  pesticide or in otherwise (immuno)compromised patients (malnutrition, chi=

AB: Foodborne-disease surveillance should be able to issue early alerts on

few
  have foodborne-disease surveillance programmes, and little is known of
  foodborne disease on a worldwide basis. However, in the last decade many
  European countries have generated annual reports to join those in Canada,
  England/Wales, Japan and the USA, and a few other countries are attemptin=
g to
  develop foodborne-disease reporting programmes but are hampered by lack o=

ic E.
  coli, or previously-known agents in new food associations such as Clostri=

ficult
  to achieve due to inadequate surveillance, low knowledge of foodborne dis=

AB: Three cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) occurred among residents of B=
adu
  Island in the Torres Strait (the area of ocean lying off the coast of
  Queensland, Australia) in early 1995. Although this was the first recogni=
zed
  outbreak of locally acquired JE in Australia, there were subsequent indic=
ations
  that JE was widespread at that time throughout the outer Torres Strait is=
lands.
  Strategies to minimise the risk of future cases of JE in the Torres Strai=
t were
  implemented. As a number of these strategies would take time to implement=
,
  vaccination of the population of the outer islands of the Torres Strait b=
efore
  the 1996 wet season was recommended. Vaccine was ordered, and mobile team=
s,
  each vaccinating seven communities in the area, administered the vaccine.
  Several clinics were established to vaccinate people who had temporarily =
moved
  away and those moving to the outer islands. JE vaccine was administered t=
o 3440
  people. The vaccination achieved high levels of uptake, with 93% of those=
 who
  commenced the series receiving two or three doses. Ongoing surveillance u=
sing
  sentinel pigs on the islands is in place to detect further incursions of =
the JE
  virus into the Torres Strait. [See also the paper by J. Shield et al. on =

AB: The effects of influenza A and B and RSV on mortality in England and Wa=
les
  were assessed by regression analysis for the period 1975-90. Morbidity da=
ta
  from sentinel practices were used to calculate 4-weekly rates of aggregat=
ed
  upper respiratory tract infections (URTI); PHLS laboratory reports were u=
sed as
  indices of infection, and 4-weekly death rates from all causes, excluding
  childbirths, were used to study relationships with mortality. Deaths corr=
elated
  strongly with influenza A and B reports, temperature, and interactions be=
tween
  aggregated URTI and temperature, and RSV outbreaks and temperature. Estim=
ates
  of 'seasonal' 4-weekly mortality associated with URTI were made by substi=
tuting
  into primary regression models the mean of annual trough consultation rat=
es for
  aggregated URTI and baseline values for RSV and influenza. Peak 4-weekly
  mortality associated with URTIs was estimated at c. 24 000 and c. 28 000 =
during
  combined influenza and RSV epidemics of 1975-6 and 1989-90 respectively.
  Secondary regression analysis was carried out with the estimated 'seasona=
l' 4
  -weekly deaths associated with URTI as dependant variable and laboratory =
data
  as regressors. Estimated excess mortality associated with influenza was
  considerable even during years without major epidemics. Overall during th=
e 15
  winters the estimated mortality associated with RSV was 60-80% more than =
that
  associated with influenza. The modelling permits only a crude estimate of=
 RSV
  associated mortality. None the less it suggests that RSV is an important =
cause
  of winter mortality.

  occurrence of congenital abnormalities and childhood tumours in children =
living
  within a 30 km radius of the Paks Nuclear Power Plant (in Hungary) and bo=

  between 1980 and 1992. Comparative analysis was made between observed and
  expected rates based on the Hungarian baseline rates. Particular attentio=
n was
  paid to the indicator conditions of germinal mutations (sentinel anomalie=
s,
  Down's syndrome and unidentified multiple congenital abnormalities) and
  leukaemias. The database of the Hungarian Congenital Abnormality Registry=
 and
  the Hungarian Childhood Tumour Registry was completed by active search an=
d
  field studies. The observed rate of total congenital abnormalities decrea=
sed
  after the operation of the nuclear plant. The observed rates of all but o=
ne
  group of congenital abnormalities corresponded to the expected rates. Fiv=
e
  spatial clusters were found: the observed rate of Down's syndrome was hig=
her in
  one, while the observed rate of unidentified multiple congenital abnormal=
ities
  was higher in four settlements, however, these were not related to radiat=
ion.
  The rates of childhood tumours corresponded to the national baseline rate=
s. No
  germinal mutagenic effect was expected on the basis of the very low
  environmental contamination of the nuclear plant. Thus, the authors concl=
ude
  that the surrounding population is not significantly exposed.

AB: Consistent temporal and spatial patterns in the activity of Culex tarsa=
lis
  and western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE) and St. Louis encephalitis (SL=
E)
  viruses were delineated that were useful in developing a stratified
  surveillance programme. Vernal increases in C. tarsalis abundance typical=
ly
  were associated with flooding of saline marshes along the north shore of =
the
  Salton Sea and were followed 6-8 weeks later by the onset of WEE and SLE =
virus
  activity. Viruses then spread to managed marsh (duck club) and agricultur=
al
  habitats in the Whitewater Channel flood plain and, depending upon the
  intensity of amplification, to agricultural and residential areas in the =
more
  elevated northwestern portion of the valley. Mean annual C. tarsalis abun=
dance
  was correlated inversely with elevation and distance from the Salton Sea.
  Abundance was greatest at managed marsh habitats. Although spatially corr=
elated
  with vector abundance among sites, virus transmission rates to sentinel
  chickens were asynchronous temporally with vector abundance. Seroconversi=
on
  rates were related to flock location but not flock size (10 vs. 20 chicke=
ns).
  Human cases were not detected during the study period, despite elevated
  transmission rates of both WEE and SLE viruses to sentinel chickens posit=
ioned
  in peridomestic habitats.

AB: The applicability of a circulating Schistosoma antigen detection assay =
for
  determining rates of infection and efficacy of chemotherapy was evaluated=
 in
  Mali. Urine egg counts were compared to circulating anodic antigen ELISA =
(CAA
  -ELISA) titres in serum, before and 6 weeks after treatment with a single=
 dose
  of praziquantel (40 mg/kg), in 2 villages in Dogon County, an area endemi=
c for
  S. haematobium. In Kassa, a village with a moderate prevalence of infecti=
on,
  the serological prevalence (48%) was significantly higher than the
  parasitological prevalence (31%). In Boro, a village with high parasitolo=
gical
  prevalence (76%), no difference was observed between the results of both
  methods (prevalence by CAA-ELISA was 75%). Cure rates estimated by CAA-EL=
ISA
  were lower than those determined parasitologically, suggesting that cure =
rates
  are overestimated by egg counting. The sensitivity of the CAA-ELISA was 7=
8%. In
  both villages, before treatment, a positive correlation was found between=
 the
  number of eggs in urine and serum CAA titres. It is concluded that, altho=
ugh
  further simplification and improvement of the sensitivity of the assay is
  needed, in its present ELISA format the antigen detection assay is useful=
 for
  monitoring sentinel populations. Furthermore, the serum CAA assay perform=
ed
  adequately in a public health laboratory within an endemic country.

AB: Previous studies have suggested using school-based surveillance to moni=
tor
  epidemic influenza-like illness in a community. Since the late 1970s, no
  studies have sought to evaluate this public health measure. The Boulder C=
ounty
  Health Department, Colorado, USA, developed, piloted, and implemented a s=
chool
  -based surveillance system beginning with the 1988-89 school year. After =
5
  seasons of surveillance, the school-based system was evaluated for sensit=
ivity
  by comparing the epidemic curves from the school-based system with those =
of a
  preexisting communicable disease sentinel surveillance system. Additional
  attributes evaluated included acceptability, simplicity, timeliness, and
  overall usefulness. Comparisons of the overall epidemic patterns suggest =
a
  close correlation between the 2 measures for the influenza seasons 1988-8=
9
  through 1992-93. The school-based system closely followed the general ris=
e,
  peak, and fall of epidemic influenza-like illness as measured by the
  preexisting sentinel system. Three of 5 epidemic peaks matched on the wee=
k of
  occurrence between the 2 surveillance systems; for the remaining seasons,=
 1989
  -90 and 1991-92, the school-based system peaked 1 week earlier than the
  sentinel system. The use of school-based surveillance has several positiv=
e
  attributes which suggests schools are an ideal setting for detecting infl=
uenza
  outbreaks, including the epidemiology of influenza which has shown childr=
en
  play an important role in the acquisition and spread of influenza-like il=
lness.
  Student populations were accessible and easily monitored by absenteeism r=
ates
  that required no diagnosis or invasive testing. All 44 schools within the
  school district readily participated in the surveillance of influenza. On=
ly
  minimal time and resources were needed for the system's maintenance. The =
school
  -based surveillance system allowed the local health department to track
  influenza-like illness activity and provide timely and important informat=
ion
  concerning outbreaks to schools, public health officials, health care
  providers, and the public.

AB: Annual epidemics of bacillary dysentery have been a public health probl=
em in
  Burundi for the last 14 years. Recent civil unrest, resulting in the
  displacement of large numbers of people into refugee settlements, has
  aggravated the situation. The authors report the results of a nationwide,
  health-centre based, sentinel site survey to check the drug resistance of
  Shigella dysenteriae type 1 (Sd1), the causal organism of such epidemics.
  Shigella spp. (of which 97% were Sd1) were isolated from 73% of the 126
  specimens collected from six main sites around the country. There was no
  difference in culture results from fresh and frozen stool specimens. Over=
all
  Sd1 resistance to commonly available antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole +
  trimethoprim, ampicillin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol) varied from =
77% to
  99% and was fairly uniformly distributed over the country. All Sd1 isolat=
es
  were susceptible to newer drugs, such as ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone.
  Resistance to nalidixic acid, the current first line of treatment for bac=
illary
  dysentery in Burundi, varied from 8% to 83% in the different sentinel sit=
es;
  global resistance was 57%.

AB: Early warning of an influenza outbreak is much to be desired and this p=
aper
  suggests a simple means by which it can be achieved. A joint study was
  performed by the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) and the Pu=
blic
  Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) in England, UK in the winters of 1992 an=
d 1993
  -94. Six practices covering 51 000 patients in different areas of England=
 were
  recruited: these were situated in Northumberland, Merseyside, West Midlan=
ds,
  Bedford, Kent and Somerset. Nasal and throat swabs from cases of 'flu-lik=
e
  illness were sent by first-class post to the Central Public Health Labora=
tory,
  Colindale, where they were examined by direct immunofluorescence (IF) for
  influenzas A H1N1 and H3N2, and for influenza B. The polymerase chain rea=
ction
  (PCR) was used to confirm positive results and for the examination of a s=
ample
  of negative specimens. In the winter of 1992-93 11 viruses were cultivate=
d from
  182 swabs: they were 3 A(H3N2), 3 A(H1N1), and 5 virus B. Virus B was dia=
gnosed
  by IF as late as March. The following winter, 1993-94, 66 type A viruses =
were
  detected by IF, culture, or both, in 279 swabs. Most were from children a=
ged 0
  -4 years, slightly less from those of 5-14 years of age, and the remainde=
r from
  adults. PCR confirmed 18 of 20 positive IF results and was positive in 8 =
of 41
  negative IF swabs. The pattern of virus infections in the 6 practices
  parallelled that of all the practices that submitted weekly returns to th=
e
  RCGP. In 1993-94 virus was detected as early as October (week 40), peaked=
 in
  early November (weak 45) and died away at the end of the year. For compar=
ison,
  reports to the PHLS by existing methods gave first virus detection at wee=
k 46
  and peak detections at week 50. Thus, the sentinel practices provided a 5=
-week
  start in viral diagnosis or isolation and all the information subsequentl=
y
  obtained from the established system. A.S. Beare.

AB: The purpose of this study was to analyse the HIV/AIDS magnitude,
  distribution, frequency, patterns, trends, risk factors, risk groups,
  estimation and evaluation of interventions in Mexico during the last 12 y=

  Results of a summary of statistics and results from several sources are
  presented including the National Registry of AIDS cases, HIV sentinel
  surveillance in 18 cities of the country, analysis of death certificates,=
 cross
  -sectional, longitudinal, observational, and intervention studies. As of =
March
  1995, 34 230 AIDS cases, 120 000 HIV infections and 21 000 AIDS deaths ar=
e
  estimated. A damaged exponential growth with duplication of AIDS cases ev=
ery 18
  months can be seen. Epidemiological patterns of transmission are found
  primarily among men with homosexual and bisexual practices. The male:fema=
le
  ratio is 6 to 1. In 1992 AIDS was the 19th most frequent cause of death a=
mong
  the general population. At least 2 patterns of transmission have been
  identified: one is the western-urban pattern which contributes more than =
90% of
  cases and the other, more recent, has been described as Caribbean-rural. =
Blood
  transmission of HIV shows a downward trend, and heterosexual and perinata=

AB: A surveillance programme of HIV infections in sentinel populations of S=

  patients at 18 centres in 15 countries in Europe was started in June 1990=
. The
  initial aim was to standardize methods of monitoring and in May 1994 the
  project received further funding from the European Commission (DGXII) for
  another 3 years. In the 4.5 years to the end of 1994 nearly 89 000 new ep=
isodes
  of STDs (with a male/female ratio of 1.79 and 70% aged 20-34) were report=
ed and
  3% of patients refused to be tested for HIV. Genital warts were seen in 3=
1.8%
  of all STD episodes (2.8% HIV positive), followed by male urethritis in 2=
1.9%
  (1.5% HIV positive). Proctitis was rare (0.2%) but strongly associated wi=
th HIV
  infection (13.0% of infections). HIV prevalence was also high in those wi=
th
  syphilis (9.1%) and chancroid (7.4%). No significant increase in HIV prev=
alence
  was observed in any of the networks with time. In all centres people with=
 newly
  acquired STDS who were already known to be HIV positive were seen and 14%=
 of
  homosexual attendees at STD clinics were aware of their seropositive stat=
us at
  the time of consultation whereas only 0.7% of the heterosexual attendees =
did
  so. The report tabulates and illustrates the data extensively.

AB: A new virus, SP An 71686, was isolated from sentinel mice exposed in a
  forest area in Iguape county, Sao Paulo state, Brazil, in 1979. The resul=
ts
  (using haemagglutination inhibition (HI), complement fixation and ELISA)
  suggest that SP An 71686 virus is a new arbovirus and that it demonstrate=
s some
  cross-reactivity with other members of the family Flaviviridae, but can b=
e
  differentiated from them. Although there is an intensive circulation of s=
everal
  arboviruses in the area, the only diagnosed cases of human disease were c=
aused
  by Rocio virus during and after the epidemic of encephalitis that occurre=
d in
  1975-77, one case of febrile illness by Caraparu virus in 1983, and by su=
btype
  IF of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus in soldiers during jungle surv=
ival
  training in 1990. Wild animals had a prevalence of SP An 71686 HI monotyp=
e
  antibodies: 46% of birds captured in 1990, 40% in 1991 and 19.5% in 1992.=
 These
  results suggested that wild birds may play a role in the virus transmissi=
on
  cycle. Mammals (rodents and marsupials) must also be considered potential
  hosts. However, the virus reservoir-vector relationships need further stu=
dies
  which would help to clarify the ecology of this virus.

 house
  fly (Musca domestica) and stable fly (Stomoxys calcitrans) pupae under am=
bient
  environmental conditions was measured. The 2 species were released 7 time=
s at 2
  -week intervals from a central location within each of the 4 feedlots. Bo=
th
  species were recovered significantly more often from sentinel pupae place=
d
  around the perimeter of each feedlot than from sentinel pupae at untreate=
d
  feedlots. Mean mortality of sentinel pupae for the 4 release feedlots ran=
ged
  from 28 to 42% compared with 4.8% for 2 untreated feedlots. Parasites rec=
overed
  from sentinel pupae comprised 87% Muscidifurax zaraptor and 12% P. vindem=
miae.
  Correlations between the percentage mortality of sentinel pupae and the n=
umber
  of parasites released were poor. However, when the interaction of weekly =
mean
  air temperature was considered, a significant correlation between reducti=
on of
  sentinel pupae and the number of parasites released was evident. Differen=
ces in
  parasitism between release and control sites were not as apparent when pa=
rasite
  emergence from naturally occurring house fly and stable fly puparia was
  determined. The indigenous M. zaraptor was clearly superior to the introd=
uced
  P. vindemmiae and readily parasitized house fly pupae around the perimete=
r of
  the release feedlots. The results also suggested that periods of mean wee=
kly

AB: Lagenidium giganteum, a facultative parasite of mosquito larvae, has
  recently been registered by the US Environmental Protection Agency for
  operational mosquito control. The 1st pilot scale production of the mycel=
ium
  formulation is reported. Scale-up from 10 to 650 litres was accomplished =
by a
  proportionate increase of medium components and volume of water. Foaming =
of the
  culture medium had not been encountered previously, but was a serious pro=
blem
  in pilot scale production due to the very rapid growth of a large volume =
of L.
  giganteum. Addition of an antifoaming agent did not adversely affect grow=
th,
  but reduced the ability of the fungus to sporulate. Despite what was
  effectively a 100-fold reduction in the desired application rate due to r=
educed
  sporulation, L. giganteum infected sentinel mosquito larvae (Culex pipien=
s) and
  reduced field populations (of C. tarsalis and Anopheles freeborni) in
  California, USA, for >2 months following application.

  transmission 3-6 weeks earlier in epizootic years, 2-4 times more frequen=
tly
  during the season, and twice as many birds within a flock seroconverted d=
uring
  a given week. Pheasants detected virus transmission at 2 sites during 2
  interepizootic years when chickens failed. Although pheasants detected St=
.
  Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus activity somewhat later than did chickens,=
 they
  had greater seroconversion rates than did chickens. Although both bird sp=
ecies
  can be used to monitor EEE and SLE viruses, pheasants are more sensitive =
than
  chickens as sentinels for EEE virus and as sensitive as chickens as senti=

AB: Dispersal of C. bezziana was studied in Papua New Guinea by releasing r=
adio
  -isotope labelled, laboratory-reared flies and collecting their labelled =
egg
  masses from sentinel cattle. A log-linear model was developed to describe
  recapture rate. Distance was found to dominate the model and was represen=
ted by
  a bilinear ('broken-stick') term as log-distance. Further terms in the mo=
del
  such as attractiveness of the site (estimated from the number of non-labe=
lled
  egg masses), the season of the year and a time trend were statistically
  significant but of minor importance. From the model, the median distance
  females dispersed before depositing an egg mass was 10.8 km. The maximum
  distance from the release site that egg masses were recovered was 100 km.=
 The
  dispersal ability of C. bezziana is discussed in terms of its impact on t=
he
  prospects of eradicating this species using the sterile insect release me=
thod

AB: Two mosquito-borne flaviviruses, Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) and K=
unjin
  (KUN), are the aetiological agents of Australian encephalitis. MVE causes=
 a
  severe and potentially fatal form of the disease, while KUN is responsibl=
e for
  only a few relatively mild cases. Therefore, it is important that serolog=
ical
  tests used in flavivirus surveillance differentiate between infections wi=
th
  these 2 viruses. However, this has been hampered in the past by the close
  antigenic relationships between flaviviruses in traditional serological a=
ssays.
  An epitope blocking ELISA using MVE-specific and KUN-specific monoclonal
  antibodies (mAb) reacting to the non-structural protein NS1 of these viru=
ses
  and a flavivirus group-specific mAb reacting to the envelope (E) protein =
was
  assessed for testing sentinel animals for seroconversion to specific flav=
ivirus
  infections. Using these assays, the authors were able to detect serum
  antibodies to a variety of flaviviruses in laboratory infected rabbits an=
d
  naturally infected chickens, and in the case of primary infections,
  differentiate those caused by KUN or MVE. These assays are now used routi=
nely
  in the laboratory for testing chicken sera from sentinel flocks in the
  Kimberley and Pilbara regions of north Western Australia.

AB: Population dynamics and bionomics of host-seeking C. tarsalis were stud=
ied
  in the Imperial and Coachella valleys of California, USA, during periods =
in
  1991 and 1992 when western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE) and St. Louis
  encephalitis (SLE) viruses were transmitted to sentinel chickens. Female
  abundance was greatest during the spring and autumn, before and after mos=
t
  virus transmission occurred and was not correlated with temperature, humi=
dity,
  or rainfall. Parity rates were highest during late summer when virus acti=
vity
  peaked and were lowest during December when females may enter a short-ter=
m
  reproductive diapause. Although most likely underestimated, the proportio=
n of
  older multiparous females were collected at a consistent, but low level
  throughout the year. Changes in the parity rate seemed to be influenced
  primarily by the proportions of 1-parous females. Survivorship estimated =
from
  the parity rate (adjusted to account for autogeny) was highest in winter;
  however, the proportion of females surviving to potentially transmit eith=
er WEE
  or SLE virus was highest in summer and early autumn. Wing length decrease=
d in
  summer as an inverse correlate of temperature and increased as a function=
 of
  female age, implying that larger females lived longest. However, autogeno=
us
  females were larger than anautogenous females at emergence and only parou=
s
  autogenous females wee collected host seeking, thereby confounding the
  relationship between size and age. The proportion of females testing posi=
tive
  for fructose was greatest during winter and lowest during summer, perhaps
  affecting survivorship and blood-feeding avidity. The vector competence
  (infection, dissemination and transmission rates, and ID50) of females
  collected host seeking or emerging from field-collected pupae for WEE or =
SLE
  viruses remained similar over time, even though the wing length of female=
s used
  in these experiments differed among samples. It was concluded that in nat=
ure
  virus transmission progressed efficiently during midsummer because elevat=
ed
  temperatures shortened the extrinsic incubation period without markedly
  decreasing survivorship resulting in an increased proportion of females
  surviving extrinsic incubation to become infective.

  both the survival of multivoltine mosquitoes, and the size of the infecti=

  reservoir in natural populations of malaria vectors. During long-term
  surveillance of a population of A. gambiae s.l. in a Tanzanian village
  (Namawala, Kilombero District) by daily light trapping, a temporary dry s=
pell
  resulted in the cessation of recruitment for a period of 33 days, and a d=
ecline
  in numbers of A. arabiensis caught from >2000 to <10 in a sentinel house.=
 Traps
  placed elsewhere in the village indicated similar proportionate declines,
  although numbers caught varied according to location. A survival rate of =
83%
  per day was estimated from the rate of population decline. Survival was
  unrelated to the size of the mosquitoes. The infectious reservoir (the ch=
ance
  of a mosquito acquiring a Plasmodium falciparum infection) was estimated =
to be
  2% per feed. The exploitation of fortuitous events which temporarily elim=
inate
  a single stage in the life cycle has general applicability in the study o=

AB: Pyrethroid-impregnated bednets are being used nationwide in The Gambia.=
 The
  future success of this malaria control programme depends partly on the ve=
ctors
  remaining susceptible to the insecticides used for treating the nets. The
  present study was carried out on the south bank of the river Gambia, duri=
ng the
  first large scale trial of nets in this country. Thus this area represent=
s a
  sentinel site for detecting insecticide resistance in local vectors. This=
 study
  gives an example of how a system of early detection for resistance proble=
ms can
  be set up in a relatively complex situation where multiple vectors and no=
n
  -vectors are present. Samples of the Anopheles gambiae complex were caugh=
t
  indoors using light traps in 12 villages used in the bednet study. In all
  villages A. gambiae s.s. was the predominant member of the complex as
  determined using the rDNA-PCR diagnostic assay (other species included A.
  arabiensis and A. melas). Limited bioassays with DDT and permethrin, and
  biochemical assays for a range of insecticide resistance mechanisms sugge=
st
  that the A. gambiae complex remains completely susceptible to all major c=
lasses
  of commonly used insecticides including pyrethroids. Biochemical assays s=
uggest
  that a low frequency of DDT resistance may occur in A. melas. This is bas=
ed on
  elevated glutathione S-transferase levels coupled with increased levels o=
f DDT
  metabolism and does not involve cross-resistance to pyrethroids. Therefor=
e a
  decline in the efficacy of treated nets against malaria vectors in the st=
udy
  area in the immediate future is not envisaged, although monitoring should=
 be
  continued whilst wide-scale use of impregnated bednets is operational.

eful
  indicators of transmission and disease, and health system relevant monito=
ring
  indicators to evaluate the impact of disease control at the community or =
health
  facility level. The KMP is a longitudinal community-based study in rural
  southern Tanzania which investigates risk factors for malarial morbidity =
and
  developing household-based malaria control strategies. Biweekly morbidity=
 and
  bimonthly serological, parasitological and drug consumption surveys are c=
arried
  out in all study households. Mosquito (Anopheles gambiae s.l. and A. fune=
stus)
  densities are measured biweekly in 50 sentinel houses by timed light trap=
s.
  Determinants of transmission and indicators of exposure were not strongly
  aggregated within households. Subjective morbidity (recalled fever), obje=
ctive
  morbidity (elevated body temperature and high parasitaemia) and chloroqui=
ne
  consumption were strongly aggregated within a few households. Nested anal=
ysis
  of anti-NANP40 antibody suggests that only _30% of the titre variance can=
 be
  explained by household clustering and that the largest proportion of anti=
body
  titre variability must be explained by non-measured behavioural determina=
nts
  relating to an individual's level of exposure within a household. Indicat=

  for evaluation and monitoring and outcome measures are described within t=

e
  first recognized arboviral disease of animals in Indonesia was bovine eph=
emeral
  fever. Serology indicates that the virus is widespread, as are related
  rhabdoviruses. Local sheep appear resistant to bluetongue disease, but im=
ported
  sheep have suffered mortalities. Bluetongue viral serotypes 1, 7, 9, 12, =
21 and
  23 have been isolated from sentinel cattle; 1, 21 and 23 at widely separa=
te
  locations. Bluetongue serotype 21 has been isolated from Culicoides spp.
  Serological reactors to Akabane virus are widespread, as are reactors to =
the
  flavivirus group. Japanese encephalitis, isolated from sentinel pigs, is =
the
  flavivirus of most veterinary importance but the limit of its easterly
  distribution is unknown.

AB: Melarsomine dihydrochloride (RM 340), a drug being developed as an
  adulticide for treatment of Dirofilaria immitis infection in dogs, was sa=
fe and
  highly effective as a clinical prophylactic agent against naturally acqui=
red
  infections using Strategic and Tactical Treatment Programs. The Strategic
  Program involved treatment every 4 months (3 series of treatments per yea=
r),
  disregarding the mosquito season (MS), to clear the existing infection at=
 each
  treatment. The Tactical Program consisted of 2 series of treatments per y=
ear, 4
  months apart, with the first one given about the middle of the MS (August=
) and
  the second one given after the end of the MS (December). Melarsomine was
  administered as 2 im injections (lumbar muscles) of 2.2 mg/kg given 3 h a=
part.
  A total of 90 heartworm-naive beagles and a number of microfilaraemic 'se=
ed'
  dogs were used. Three similar experiments (30 beagles per experiment) wer=
e
  conducted at selected areas (Georgia, Florida, Louisiana) known to be enz=
ootic
  for heartworm. At each site, 30 beagles were allocated to 6 groups of 5 d=
ogs
  each, and 4 of these groups were placed outdoors in April of 1988. Two gr=
oups
  (control and treated) were exposed for 12 months, and the treated group w=
as
  given melarsomine at 4, 8, and 12 months after exposure was started (Stra=
tegic
  Program). Another group was exposed for 8 months and treated with melarso=
mine
  at 4 and 8 months (Tactical Program). One group of tracer (sentinel) beag=
les
  was exposed from April to August 1988, one group from August to December =
1988,
  and another from December 1988 to April 1989. April-August and August-Dec=
ember
  tracers served as controls for the tactically treated dogs. After exposur=
e, all
  dogs were held indoors for 5 months before necropsy. Blood was collected =
at 4-5
  month intervals and examined for microfilariae (MF) and adult heartworm a=
ntigen
  (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ELISA). Treatment by the Strategic Pr=
ogram
  was 99% effective, with only one of the total of 15 treated dogs harbouri=
ng any
  worms (a single female) at necropsy. 13 of the 14 control dogs (93%) expo=
sed
  for 12 months became infected, with average worm recoveries of 6.8, 5.4, =
and
  25.2 (range 1-45) for the Georgia, Florida, and Louisiana sites, respecti=
vely.
  All of the 13 heartworm-infected control dogs were antigen-positive, and =
12 of
  these were also MF-positive, while none of the strategically treated dogs=
 was
  either antigen- or ll820hh MF-positive at necropsy. Tactical treatment of=
 the
  total of 14 dogs twice per year was 100% effective. 86% (combined average=
) of
  the April-August tracers and 73% of the August-December tracers had heart=
worms.
  None of the 14 tactically treated dogs was positive for antigen or MF at
  necropsy, while 17 of the 29 controls were antigen-positive, and 4 of the=
se
  were also MF-positive.

AB: The classical method of estimating the density of Plasmodium falciparum=

with a

  trophozoites/=B5l blood gave 9.5% and 99.5% positive fields, respectively=

  <5% of slides with 100% positive fields were of blood with <2000
  trophozoites/=B5l. The proportion with high parasitaemia (PHP) in a popul=
ation,
  defined as the proportion of individuals with 100% positive fields, is pr=
oposed
  as a simple and reliable indicator of relative changes in malaria morbidi=
ty due
  to seasonal fluctuations or control activities. However, the use of this =
index
  is limited to areas with intermediate malaria stability. Data from a
  longitudinal survey in Burundi, presented to illustrate the use of PHP, s=
how
  that PHP undergoes important fluctuations related to transmission. In con=
trast
  to the parasite index, the amplitude of fluctuations in PHP decreases wit=
h age
  as a result of acquired protective immunity. Although 2 health centres, o=
ne in
  a vector control area and one in an area with no control, reported simila=

  proportions of cases of clinical malaria among their patients, PHP was ab=
out 3
  times lower in patients from the vector control areas. The estimation of =
the
  efficacy of a malaria control programme from simple clinical information
  appears unreliable. Sentinel health centres, each equipped with a microsc=
ope to
  estimate PHP, may often be better indicators of changes in morbidity.

e the
  oral toxicity and carcinogenicity potential of olestra, a fat substitute
  consisting of a mixture of the hexa-, hepta- and octaesters of sucrose fo=
rmed
  with long-chain fatty acids. In a dose-response study, olestra was fed at=
 0,
  2.5, 5 or 10% (w/w) of the diet. In a companion study conducted to confir=
m
  equivocal effects, olestra was fed at 0 or 10% (w/w) of the diet. Olestra
  -containing diets were supplemented with fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and=
 K to
  maintain the nutritional status of the olestra-fed mice at a level simila=
r to
  that of the control mice. 100 mice/sex were placed in each group. 50
  mice/sex/group were predesignated to the carcinogenicity portion of the s=
tudy
  and all survivors were killed at 24 months. 15 mice/sex/group were
  predesignated to the toxicity portion of the study and were killed at 12
  months. 35 mice/sex/group were included as sentinel animals to be used fo=
r
  monitoring nutritional status. Ophthalmoscopic examinations were conducte=
d
  before the test and at 12 and 24 months. Body weights and food consumptio=
n were
  estimated weekly. Gross observations, clinical chemistry and haematology =
data
  were obtained on mice killed at 12 and 24 months. Complete gross postmort=
em
  examinations, including organ weight and organ-to-body and organ-to-brain
  weight ratios were performed on all mice. Histopathology was conducted on=
 a
  full complement of tissues from all mice allocated to the carcinogenicity
  portions of the studies. There were no olestra-related effects on any of =
the
  endpoints measured, including survival, time-to-tumour or tumour incidenc=
e,
  ophthalmology, clinical chemistry, haematology, organ weights or tissue
  morphology. The results indicate that olestra is not toxic or carcinogeni=

AB: A study of anthropometric status of children <5 years old, was conducte=
d in
  the Nqutu district of KwaZulu, South Africa, by means of a representative
  community-based sample and concurrent samples from primary health care cl=
inics,
  preschools and primary schools. The extent of acute nutritional stress in=
 the
  district was evaluated as an indication of the appropriateness of food re=
lief
  efforts in the region. The absence of wasting and the high prevalence of
  stunting (37.5%) suggested that the main problem was chronic socioeconomi=
c
  underdevelopment, rather than a severe or immediate lack of food. The fac=
t that
  <20% of households were in any way reliant on domestic production for the=
ir
  maize requirements explains why a drought that occurred did not have a gr=
eater
  impact on the nutritional state of this vulnerable group. The usefulness =
of
  clinics, preschools and schools as sites for the collection of anthropome=
tric
  data and the development of nutritional programmes was also evaluated.

  postoperative wound infections, and 291 of these cases were matched 1:1 t=

d
  using national activity data, the authors established an empirical cost m=
odel
  based on the estimated marginal costs of hospital resources and social si=
ck
  pay. It showed that the hospital resources spent on the 10 groups, which
  represent half of the postoperative wound infections in Denmark, amounted=
 to
  about 0.5% of the annual national hospital budget. This stratified model
  creates a better basis for selecting groups of operations which need prio=

AB: The author of this important and interesting editorial was formerly Chi=
ef
  Medical Officer, Leprosy, WHO, Geneva, and it was under his guidance that=
 WHO
  developed its strategy for the 'Chemotherapy of leprosy for control progr=
ammes'
  (Report of a WHO Study Group, Technical Report Series 675) in 1982, advis=
ing
  the use of regimens of multiple drug therapy of relatively short duration=
 for
  all forms of leprosy. Twelve full years after that publication, he review=
s the
  current leprosy situation worldwide, the current strategy for leprosy con=
trol
  and the elimination strategy, and then proceeds to analyse both the
  improvements and the problems which may be expected. Attention is drawn t=
o the
  contribution of the elimination strategy (reduction of prevalence to <1 c=
ase/10
  000 population by the year 2000) to improved case detection, the developm=
ent of
  selected indicators and "sentinel centres" for the improved monitoring of=
 low
  -incidence situations and the improvements in coverage by multiple drug
  therapy. However, to proceed effectively and to achieve the elimination t=
arget
  by the year 2000, there is a need for (1) additional financial resources,=
 (2)
  greater attention to disability prevention and management, (3) improved c=
ase
  detection, delivery of multiple drug therapy, treatment compliance and th=
e
  monitoring of progress in low prevalence/incidence situations. He conclud=
es
  that the advantages of the elimination strategy, in sequence and as a nat=
ural
  expansion of the control strategy, outweigh the disadvantages-but he incl=
udes
  an important word of advice: "I strongly feel that those responsible for
  leprosy work should not only try to increase the impact of the available
  technology on the leprosy problem, but should do so within the minimum ti=
me
  interval". [This publication should be read in the original by all involv=
ed in
  the control and elimination of leprosy.] A.C. McDougall

AB: The authors set out to examine genetic and environmental factors in the
  origin of isolated congenital limb deficiencies by a case-control study w=
ith
  questionnaire at a family interview of cases of isolated congenital limb
  deficiencies (six types), negative controls (matched for age, sex, and pl=
ace of
  residence), and positive controls (cases of sentinel anomalies). The subj=
ects,
  obtained from the database of the Hungarian Congenital Abnormality Regist=
ry,
  1975-84, complemented by three other sources of ascertainment (1 575 904
  births), were 537 case-control pairs and 392 positive controls. Smoking d=
uring
  pregnancy and congenital limb deficiencies were evaluated. The adjusted r=
ate of
  smoking during pregnancy was significantly higher in the mothers of cases=
 of
  terminal transverse defect (relative odds 1.48; 95% confidence interval 0=
.98 to
  2.23; P =3D 0.017). This finding supports the hypothesis of vascular disr=
uption
  as a cause of congenital limb deficiency. The authors conclude that mater=
nal
  smoking during pregnancy raises the relative odds for terminal transverse=
 limb
  deficiencies.

 area
  in southern lower Michigan were recruited as sentinel surveillance sites.=
 The
  practices were asked to collect specimens for virus isolation and/or data=
 on
  age-specific frequency of respiratory illnesses that met a case definitio=
n.
  Data were used to establish periods of influenza virus activity for the
  determination of vaccine efficacy. Over three study periods, 1989-1992, t=
here
  were documented outbreaks of influenza type A(H3N2), type A(H1N1), and ty=
pe B.
  The incidence of influenza-like illness increased during these outbreaks,=
 with
  variation in age-specific frequency from year to year. Recovery of virus =
was
  not affected during the winter season by long delays in specimen receipt =
by the
  laboratory. Results indicated that medical practices can be successfully
  recruited as surveillance sites to provide information on the timing,
  aetiology, and intensity of acute respiratory illness.

PB: National Council for Population and Development; Nairobi; Kenya
PY: 1994
LA: English
AB: Between the first report of a case of AIDS in Kenya in late 1984 and la=
te
  June 1994 the Ministry of Health received notification of 49 879 cases, w=
ith
  reports from every district. The true number of cases of AIDS is not know=
n but
  is estimated to have reached well over 150 000 by the middle of 1994. Sim=
ilarly
  the number of people infected with HIV is not known but in 1993 some 760 =
000
  people including some 30 000 children were believed to be infected, a fig=
ure
  that has been raised to about 1 million in early 1995. The National AIDS
  Control Programme (NACP) reports that adult HIV seroprevalence was very l=
ow in
  the early 1980s but has been increasing rapidly in the past few years. It=
s
  figures suggest a rate in adults of 3.5% in 1991, 4.5% in 1991, 5.3% in 1=
992
  and 5.7% in 1993 (range 5.2-6.2%): 1 in every 18 adults. The urban preval=
ence
  rate in 1993 is put at 11-12% and the rural rate at 4-5% (although there =
is
  very little information about the rural epidemic). Applying these rates t=
o
  populations, the NACP derives figures of 480 000 infected adults in rural=
 areas
  and 250 000 in urban areas. Sentinel surveillance has been instituted for=
 4
  years in antenatal clinics in 13 urban sites throughout the country. Data=
 for
  1993 show that at three centres, all in the south-west of the country, th=
e
  rates in pregnant women were between 20% and 30%. In several centres the =
rates
  were between 10% and 20%, whereas elsewhere the rates were in the range 2=
-10%.
  In Kisumu on the Ugandan border the rate has been steady at about 20% for=
 4
  years, reflecting an area with high infection levels and the number of ne=
w
  infections each year equalling the number of people dying from AIDS. The =
rate
  in Nairobi in 1993 was one of the lowest in central, eastern and southern
  Africa. Three quarters of infections are being acquired heterosexually, w=
ith
  20% perinatally. Blood is now screened and few new infections are due to =
blood
  transfusions. About three quarters of all cases of AIDS are in people age=
d 20
  -45, with peaks for women at 25-29 and for men at 30-34. With some 17% of
  pregnant women in Nairobi testing positive for HIV in 1993 and the preval=
ence
  increasing rapidly in most areas of the country, the rate in the capital =
is
  expected to rise to about 24% by the year 2000, with a "conservative" nat=
ional
  figure of 9%-"without effective interventions, it could be much worse" [a=
nd,
  compared with other capitals such as Lusaka and Harare, there is little
  evidence on the streets of Nairobi of awareness campaigns]. On this
  conservative projection the number of people infected by the year 2000 is=
 put
  at 1.6 million and by 2005 at 1.9 million, with AIDS deaths rising from a=
bout
  100 000 this year to 1 million by 2000 and more than 2 million by 2005.
  Nevertheless AIDS is not expected to cause population growth to stop or
  decline; changes in total fertility rate will have a much greater impact.=
 AIDS
  is expected soon to become the major cause of infant and child mortality =
rates,
  overtaking other causes such as measles and malaria. HIV/AIDS is expected=
 to
  slow the decline in deaths in infants under 1 year and to maintain or eve=
n
  increase the mortality rate of 1-5 year olds. The number of children aged=
 15 or
  less who have lost their mother to AIDS is expected to reach 600 000 by 2=
000
  and almost 1 million by 2005 (among a projected population of 34 million)=
. At
  the family level this will increase the burden and stress in extended fam=
ilies,
  with many grandparents caring for young children and some families headed=
 by
  youngsters of 10-12 years. At the community and national level society wi=
ll
  have to carry a greater burden to provide services for these children (e.=
g.
  health care and school fees) and there will be a growing population of ur=
ban
  street children. Tuberculosis control programmes have shown successes ove=
r the
  past 20 years but HIV has triggered a sharp increase in cases. More than =
90 000
  new cases of TB due to HIV are expected by 2005 [it is reported that most=
 of
  the new TB cases early in the HIV epidemic were in HIV-infected people wh=
ereas
  that is not true now: the TB epidemic appears to have attained its own
  momentum]. A 1992 analysis projected figures for total hospital costs of =
the
  equivalent of the entire 1993-94 recurrent budget of the Ministry of Heal=
th. In
  1992 about 15% of all hospital beds in the country were occupied by AIDS
  patients. Government planners recognize the major burden AIDS is posing t=
o the
  economy. The economic impacts are thought likely to be greatest among gro=
ups
  such as the military (which will be severely affected), mobile work force=
s,
  banking, and agriculture. In the last sector the impacts are likely to be
  greatest in dry areas where farming depends on one or two crops that must=
 be
  planted and harvested in specific seasons; loss of a few workers at these
  crucial periods will reduce the size of the harvest, making it difficult =
for
  families to feed themselves. Moreover, loss of agricultural labour will f=
orce a
  switch to food crops from export crops. Persisting misconceptions about H=
IV
  transmission and little awareness about the role of condoms or abstinence
  indicate scope for information and education campaigns. The government's =
AIDS
  Programme Secretariat drew up a plan in 1992 which called for action in 6
  areas: prevention of sexual transmission of HIV (through youth education,
  community-based education, workplace initiatives and promotion of condom =
use);
  security of the blood supply and products; mitigation of the socioeconomi=

  impacts; surveillance; coordination of research; and management and

AB: Surveillance is the foundation of public health practice. This review
  examines the experience of surveillance in the Expanded Programme on
  Immunization (EPI). Surveillance systems include routine reporting, senti=
nel
  surveillance, and community-based reporting. Data from ongoing surveillan=
ce
  should be linked with those from supervision, health facility assessments=
,
  population surveys, and outbreak investigations to provide information fo=
r
  programme planning, implementation, evaluation, and modification. Evaluat=
ion of
  surveillance systems should assess the extent to which data are used for =
policy
  -making and programme improvement, and the simplicity, accuracy, complete=
ness,
  timeliness and cost of the data. The surveillance of vaccine-preventable
  diseases has evolved as programmes mature, to monitor progress towards di=
sease
  control targets. The establishment of goals to reduce measles cases by 90=
%,
  eliminate neonatal tetanus, and eradicate poliomyelitis has put increased
  emphasis on the need for effective disease surveillance. This opportunity
  should be taken to promote strengthening of national routine systems for
  disease surveillance, to make them effective instruments for prevention a=
nd
  control of diseases of public health importance.

  general practitioners, virus isolate data for respiratory syncytial virus=
 (RSV)
  and influenza A and B viruses, and registered deaths, during the past fou=
r
  winters. Cases of acute respiratory disease (ARD) and deaths (3-week movi=
ng
  averages) showed strong similarity in timing. Periods of high incidence o=
f ARD
  and numbers of deaths were followed within 2-3 weeks by reports of high n=
umbers
  of RSV or influenza virus isolates. The epidemic period in December, 1989=
, was
  followed by high numbers of both virus isolates, but in all other epidemi=
c
  periods one virus predominated. The lethality of epidemics due to RSV or
  influenza A or B varied both within and between years. These analyses sug=
gest
  that RSV is as important as influenza viruses in causing morbidity and ex=
cess
  deaths among elderly people. RSV was prevalent at the end of each of the =
past 4
  years in the UK; its importance as a cause of excess deaths would therefo=
re be
  concealed in any analysis based on several years' experience. By contrast=
, the
  inconsistency of epidemics due to influenza viruses makes excess deaths d=
ue to
  these viruses easily recognisable. Integrated clinical and virological
  surveillance is essential if epidemics due to RSV, influenza virus, or an=
y
  other virus are to be correctly interpreted.

AB: To improve measles control in Kinshasa, Zaire, a project to increase va=

hanged
  measles vaccination policy from Schwartz vaccine at age 9 months to mediu=
m
  titre Edmonston Zagreb (EZ) vaccine at age 6 months. The authors report t=
he
  impact of the programme on measles incidence and mortality. Data on vacci=
ne
  coverage were obtained from cluster sample surveys conducted every 1-2 ye=
ars
  and from routine reports of vaccine doses administered. Data on measles
  incidence and mortality were obtained from sentinel surveillance sites. T=
he
  serological responses to EZ measles vaccine was evaluated at a health cen=
tre in
  1989 and in a community survey in 1990. Measles vaccine coverage estimate=
d in
  cluster surveys increased from 50% of the 1984 birth cohort to 89% of the=
 1989
  birth cohort, accepting either a home-based record or a verbal history of
  vaccination. Reported measles incidence per 100 000 population decreased =
by
  over 90%, from 37.5 in 1980 (early vaccination years) to 1.6 in 1991. The=
re was
  a relative decrease in the proportion of cases aged <9 months (32% of cas=
es in
  1986-1987 and 23% of cases in 1990-91) and an increase in the proportion =
aged
  >23 months (29% of cases in 1986-87 and 43% in 1990-91). According to ELI=
SA
  assays, 74-76% of children seroresponded to EZ vaccine administered at ag=
e 6-7
  months under routine programme conditions. The authors conclude that meas=
les
  can be controlled in urban areas, although it is difficult to determine h=
ow
  great a contribution vaccination at age 6 months makes over and above the
  achievement of high coverage.

AB: Genetic and phenotypic diversity were evaluated within two natural
  populations of Eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) virus. The Maryland
  strain was isolated from Culiseta melanura and a sentinel bobwhite quail =
on the
  Delmerva peninsula. New York isolates were from songbirds and C. melanura
  collected near Syracuse. RNA fingerprinting revealed that most population=
s
  within infected hosts (unpassaged isolates) contained a consensus genotyp=
e
  along with minority genotypes differing in 1-3 T1)>-resistant oligonucleo=
tides.
  Mutation frequencies were similar to those reported for other RNA viruses=
,
  suggesting that the slow rate of EEE virus evolution is not limited by fi=
delity
  of genome replication. Within a given year, genetic diversity was general=
ly
  greater among geographically distant isolates than among those from the s=
ame
  transmission focus, suggesting that dispersal among EEE viruses in North
  America is not complete annually. Two of 3 bird isolates from Maryland an=
d New
  York contained relatively distantly related genotypes, differing in 15-19
  oligonucleotides. A 1985 mosquito isolate from Maryland contained stable,=
 small
  plaque variants which comprised the majority of that population. These sm=
all
  plaque variants differed by up to 8 T1-resistant oligonucleotides when co=
mpared
  with their large plaque counterparts. Temperature sensitive virus was not
  detected in 6 unpassaged mosquito isolates from Maryland and New York.

  Getah virus (GETV) ranged from 15.5 to 26.3% in sera collected from pigs =
in
  South Korea in 1988-1993. The infection was more prevalent in southern re=

  of the peninsula. When a survey was conducted by age groups from August t=

  October in 1993, serum neutralizing antibodies against GETV were detected=
 in
  9.2 to 32.6% of sera from feeder pigs and in 21.1 to 72.9% of sera from s=
ows.
  Among 20 GETV sero-negative sentinel sows, seroconversion was first detec=
ted in
  July and continued to September. It is suggested that the infection might=
 be
  closely related to the appearance of mosquitos during that season.

AB: The suitability of serological surveys of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus=
) in
  determining the spread of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) was tested=
 in a
  south German area with a low risk of TBEV infection to man. Serum samples=
 from
  192 hunted roe deer were screened by haemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) a=
nd
  ELISA. Positive samples were tested in a neutralization test (NT). 50 (26=
%)
  serum samples were positive by ELISA and 43 (86%) of these were confirmed=
 by
  HAI or NT. 47 (24.5%) samples were positive by HAI, 44 (93.6%) of which w=
ere
  also positive in NT or ELISA. An insignificant increase of antibody preva=
lence
  with age (P =3D 0.17 for HAI antibodies) suggests that most infections oc=
cur at
  an early age in scattered natural foci. The antibody prevalence in female=
s was
  lower than in males (OR =3D 0.63; P =3D 0.02 for HAI antibodies). For exa=
mining the
  distribution of seropositive roe deer the sample size was increased to 23=
5
  sera. No antibodies were detected in 56 (23.8%) serum samples collected i=
n the
  eastern third of the country. The areas of high antibody prevalence in ro=
e deer
  match those in which man has been infected. It was concluded that serosur=
veys
  of roe deer are useful in marking out areas in which man faces the risk o=
f
  infection, provided that an adequate number of serum samples, preferably =
from
  males, is available.

AB: Muscidifurax zaraptor was released at 3 rates in 9 beef cattle feedlots=
 in
  eastern Nebraska, USA, to measure dosage response. Dosage response was me=
asured
  by the percentage parasitism of sentinel Musca domestica pupae. Releases =
were
  made from a single location near the centre of the pen at 3 feedlots, fro=
m 2
  locations within the pen at 3 feedlots and from 4 corners of the pen at 3
  feedlots. One-time releases initiated field propagation of Muscidifurax
  zaraptor using freeze-killed house fly pupae as hosts. 3 treatment rates,
  averaging 4480, 20 300 and 37 100 parasitoids, were released weekly over =
a 15
  -week period with each of the 3 release methods receiving a low, medium, =
or
  high treatment rate. All 9 release sites produced significantly higher le=
vels
  of parasitoid emergence and sentinel host mortality than sentinel hosts a=
t 2
  control facilities. The 3 sites receiving the high treatment rate average=
d 38%
  host mortality, compared with 26% for the medium treatment rate and 17% f=
or the
  low treatment rate. The 2 control sites averaged 2% host mortality. No
  significant differences could be detected in the number of release statio=
ns
  except at the 4-station method using the low treatment rate. High tempera=
tures
  during at least 2 of the weekly periods were detrimental to the released
  parasitoids.

  from eastern Nebraska, USA, was evaluated in the field for its potential =
as a
  biological control agent for Musca domestica and Stomoxys calcitrans.
  Muscidifurax sp. was released at 3 beef cattle feedlot pens, 3 times at 3=
-week
  intervals at 50 000, 100 000 or 200 000 parasitized hosts per treatment. =
Mean
  host mortality in sentinel house fly pupae reached 94% 2 weeks after the =
1st
  release, but parasitism decreased to 72% after 3 weeks. Similar trends we=
re
  observed with the 2nd and 3rd releases. Also, large numbers of parasite p=
rogeny
  were recovered from sentinel cohorts, suggesting that many of the release=
d
  parasites found the sentinel pupae. Parasitism by Muscidifurax sp. was
  substantially lower, 27.4 and 12.2%, respectively, in naturally occurring=
 house
  fly and stable fly pupae than that observed in sentinel hosts. Little
  correlation was evident between mean host mortality and a given parasite
  release rate. This Muscidifurax sp. has a high reproductive capacity, is =
easily
  reared, and appears to be one of the more effective species commercially
  available for fly control on midwestern beef and dairy cattle confinement=

  predictable, beginning each year during late spring. Wild pigs are abunda=
nt.
  Insects were collected by light trap during 1988 and stored on dry ice. A=

  sorting, 610 pools of phlebotomine sandflies (19 397 flies), 35 pools of
  Culicoides midges (871 flies) and 48 pools of mosquitoes (1195 flies) on =
dry
  ice were submitted to the US Department of Agriculture for virus assay.
  Isolation of VSNJ virus was made only from the phlebotomine sandflies, fo=
r
  which 6 out of 186 pools of females without blood and collected at differ=
ent
  sites were positive. Only 1 species of phlebotomine is found on the islan=
d,
  Lutzomyia shannoni.The serological monitoring of sentinel pigs, both wild=
 and
  domestic, during the collection period indicated that virus transmission =
began
  in late April and continued until August when the study terminated. Vesic=
ular
  lesions were seen on the snouts of 10 of the wild sentinel pigs. The numb=
ers of
  Lutzomyia caught in the light traps were high in June to early August and=
 this
  peak in numbers coincided with an increase in seroconversions and with
  isolations of virus from the flies. The association between fly numbers a=

AB: A large-scale control trial in the Congo against Glossina palpalis palp=
alis,
  utilising pyramidal traps which do not require repeated insecticidal
  impregnations to kill the flies, commenced in May 1985 and involved 55 vi=
llages
  situated in wooded savanna country with gallery forest. In some of the vi=
llage
  areas the density of G. p. palpalis apparent from traps (DAT) was reduced=
 to
  zero but in others a low DAT, presumed to represent immigration of 'wild'=
 flies
  along gallery forest, persisted. Evaluation of the trial was supplemented=
 by
  experimental utilisation of sentinel animals, i.e. 564 domestic animals (=
pigs,
  sheep, goats), which were examined parasitologically (wet blood films, an=
d the
  haematocrit centrifugation technique of P.T.K. Woo (1970) [see Acta Tropi=
ca,
  27: 385-386]) and serologically (Testryps card agglutination test for
  trypanosomiasis (CATT) [see E. Magnus et al. (1978) Annales de la Societe=
 Belge
  de Medecine Tropicale, 58: 169-176]) in 6 villages. When and where the DA=
T fell
  to zero, it took a further year for the parasite rate and 2 years for
  seropositivity to follow suit in the sentinel animals. If only a relative
  decrease in DAT occurred it was followed by reduction in seroparasitologi=
cal
  prevalence rates. The use of a serological test by which Trypanosoma cong=
olense
  antibodies can be distinguished, such as Testryps CATT, is particularly u=
seful
  for estimating the animal transmission level. These preliminary results
  indicate that such kinds of continuous monitoring of sentinel pigs and sh=
eep
  can constitute a useful means of evaluating the efficiency of control of
  sleeping sickness vectors.

lex
  tritaeniorhynchus was very low among the 4 pig farms where outbreaks of
  abortion caused by JE virus were observed in swine populations. At one fa=
rm
  near Sapporo, only one C. tritaeniorhynchus was found among a total of 51=
0
  mosquitoes collected during the survey period from July to October 1985, =
even
  when JE virus activity among sentinel pigs was revealed by seroconversion=
. At
  another farm in the south, no individuals of this species were found amon=
g 987
  mosquitoes collected at the time of the outbreaks of abortion. C. pipiens
  pallens, Anopheles spp., Aedes vexans nipponii and A. japonicus were more
  abundant than C. tritaeniorhynchus and Tripteroides bambusa. C.
  tritaeniorhynchus, almost the only vector of JE virus in the southern par=
t of
  Japan, is probably not a vector of the virus in Hokkaido. The collected
  mosquitoes (2332 from 1985 and 1403 from 1986) were processed for virus
  isolation but no JE virus was isolated.

  congolense appears not to be confined to the coastal region nor to any
  particular species of tsetse flies and may contribute significantly to

AB: "A sentinel health information system using telematics and a network of
  general practitioners was set up in Aquitaine in south western France in =
1986.
  Among the health problems under surveillance was acute diarrhoea. Data fo=
r each
  patient who fulfilled the usual case definition for acute diarrhoea were
  reported by general practitioners using home terminals (Minitels) connect=
ed to
  a central computer by telephone. Over one year 2234 cases of diarrhoea we=
re
  reported, the incidence varying from 0.8 to 1.5 cases per doctor per week=
.
  Seasonal variations in incidence were observed, with peaks in the winter =
and in
  the summer. Only 379 (17%) episodes of diarrhoea were classified as sever=
e, and
  these patients consulted their general practitioners earlier than patient=
s
  whose diarrhoea was less severe. Foreign travel was rarely found in the
  patients' histories, but clusters of cases were found in communities (4.6=
%)
  [104 cases] and in families (22.3%) [499 cases]. The advantages of this s=
ystem
  were easy reporting and immediate feedback, but it was difficult to extra=
polate
  the data, and the system was inadequate for intervening in outbreaks of
  diarrhoeal disease. Our knowledge of diarrhoeal diseases in south west Fr=
ance
  improved."The original nationwide network [Abst. Hyg., 1987, 62, abst. 11=
28]
  included 250 GPs and in this study 83 participated. These were identified=
 as
  doctors who made at least half the expected number of weekly connections =
to the
  central computer; a minimum of one a week was requested. [One problem wit=
h the
  system is the question of the representativeness of the patients visiting=
 GPs
  in France.] The authors recognize that this surveillance system is probab=
ly not
  the best way to detect outbreaks of food poisoning because the sample is =
too
  small and lacks aetiological data; it is most useful for epidemics such a=
s
  influenza that are caused by one strain that spreads rapidly through a re=
gion
  or country, with a single mode of transmission. Nevertheless the 104 comm=
unity
  outbreaks, reported by 100 physicians, shows that the frequency of such
  outbreaks in France is underestimated: in 1988, only 309 outbreaks were
  reported across the country through mandatory notification. (Further
  information about the network, now with 550 participants-1% of the countr=
y's
  GPs-is published in a subsequent issue (Mar. 17, p. 701), together with c=
olour
  charts of the spread of influenza across France in weeks 49-51 of 1989.)[=

AB: "An epidemic of poliomyelitis was recognized in May 1987 when there was=
 a
  sharp increase in the number of children with acute paralytic poliomyelit=
is
  admitted to the SAT Hospital in Trivandrum in Kerala State. From May thro=
ugh
  September, 392 cases were admitted; the total admitted cases in 1987 were=
 458
  in contrast to 119 in 1986. Evidence for type 1 poliovirus infection was =
found
  in 33 (85%) of the 39 children in whom virological investigations were do=
ne
  during the epidemic. In addition, evidence for poliovirus type 3 infectio=
n was
  found in 4 children. Data on the immunization status was available on 231
  affected children in the epidemic; 175 (76%) had not received oral polio
  vaccine (OPV); 55 (24%) had received 1 or 2 doses and only 1 child had re=
ceived
  3 doses. Thus, lack of immunization was a major risk factor for disease. =
The
  estimated vaccine coverage with 3 doses of OPV in Kerala, based on the qu=
antity
  of vaccine distributed during the years 1985, 1986 and 1987 were 94%, 100=
% and
  91%, respectively. This outbreak occurred in spite of high vaccine covera=
ge,
  and it illustrates the need for even higher coverage rates; the usefulnes=
s of
  hospitals as sentinel surveillance centres; the need for decentralized va=
ccine
  coverage data in order to prevent build-up of unimmunized susceptible chi=
ldren
  in any region; and the urgent need of a mechanism to respond to an epidem=
ic
  quickly, with immunization, in order to curtail it."Of 231 paediatric pat=
ients
  in the epidemic and studied in detail, only 56 (24%) had received any ora=
l
  poliovaccine (OPV), and only 1 had received 3 doses. OPV gave therefore h=
igh
  protection but the coverage rates were not high enough to avoid a suscept=
ible
  number of children in the community. Diagnosis was made in a few by stool
  culture, and IgM determinations was also carried out: IgM specific titres=
 for
  only 1 poliovirus type seemed effective diagnosis of infection by that ty=
pe. Of
  the 231 cases 208 had spinal poliomyelitis, and 23 bulbar or bulbospinal
  disease. Of 458 cases seen in 1987, 53 died. In the epidemic one-third of
  patients were aged <1 year, and another third 1-2 years. Of 39 cases
  investigated 33 gave evidence of type 1 infection, 4 of type 3 and in 2 r=
esults
  were not conclusive. The authors regard the 33 as epidemic cases, the 4 t=
ype 3
  cases as sporadic.The evidence shows that vaccine was highly protective.
  Reasons for failure to immunize were given by parents, mainly apathy. If =
an
  intense vaccination programme had been arranged as soon as the epidemic w=
as
  detected the epidemic might have lasted only 1, not 5 months. [An authori=

 these

. Data
  collected from major teaching hospitals allowed comparison of pre- and po=

  collected information unobtainable from health facilities. Sentinel clini=
c
  surveillance data indicated that diarrheal disease accounted for the grea=
test
  number of clinic visits, while malaria was the second most common reason =
for
  seeking medical attention. Malaria blood smear surveys showed that the
  parasitemia prevalence ranged from 11% to 19% in the general population a=
nd
  from 21% to 46% among febrile clinic patients. Hospital admission data
  demonstrated an increase in morbidity from diarrhea and malaria in August=
 1988,
  when compared to previous months and August of the previous year, althoug=
h it
  is uncertain whether this increase was due to the flood. Nutrition survey=
s
  demonstrated that 23% of young children were moderately or severely
  undernourished, with substantial variation by area of the city. No major
  outbreaks of communicable disease were detected in the 4 weeks after the =
flood.
  Disease surveillance provided data useful in identifying public health
  problems, setting priorities, targeting interventions and controlling rum=
ors.
  Disease control measures taken by the Ministry of Health included provisi=
on of
  potable water, standardization of medical care, and distribution of
  immunizations, oral rehydration salts, and vitamin supplements to childre=
n.[In

  infections were highly concentrated among men. However, the male-to-femal=

AB: The surveillance of AIDS through case reporting only reflects the

the
  prevalence of HIV seropositivity. HIV infection is not a notifiable condi=
tion
  in Quebec. [The authors] were asked by the Ministere de la Sante et des
  Services sociaux du Quebec to perform a pilot project for the surveillanc=
e of
  HIV seropositivity using a network of sentinel physicians. From May 15, 1=
988,
  to Sept 30, 1989, physicians from 4 collaborating centres collected data =
on the
  serologic status, demographic characteristics and risk factors for 4209
  patients who underwent HIV antibody testing. Of the 3899 subjects include=
d in
  the study 7.9% were HIV positive. Through logistic regression analysis th=
e
  following variables were found to be significantly associated with HIV
  seropositivity: presence of HIV-related symptoms (prevalence odds ratio [=
POR]
  36.5), origin from an endemic area (POR 9.1), homosexuality or bisexualit=
y (POR
  8.4), intravenous drug use (POR 4.2), male sex (POR 2.8), previous HIV an=
tibody
  testing (POR 2.5) and previous sexually transmitted disease (POR 1.8). Ov=
er the
  study period [the authors] found a large increase in HIV seroprevalence a=
mong
  intravenous drug users (4.2% in 1988 to 19.0% in 1989) (P =3D 0.02). This
  increase might reflect a recent change in the epidemiological pattern of =
HIV
  transmission in Quebec. Surveillance of HIV seropositivity through a netw=
ork of
  sentinel physicians may be a reasonable alternative to mandatory reportin=
g.The
  discussion deals with some of the problems associated with the surveillan=
ce of
  HIV-infections through networks of health providers: incomplete ascertain=
ment
  of HIV-cases since not all HIV-infected subjects request testing, the cha=
nge in
  testing patterns over time, and the problem of identifying people who hav=
e been
  tested more than once. In addition, data on subjects testing HIV-seronega=
tive
  are generally not available from these studies. The authors conclude that
  because of these limitations HIV surveillance in itself does not provide =
enough
  information adequately to monitor the prevalence of HIV-infections in the
  general population. Anonymous unlinked seroprevalence studies are also
  required. HIV-surveillance through sentinel networks could be an alternat=
ive to
  mandatory reporting of HIV-infections, however.L.H. Lumey=20

 CO2

  encephalitis (WEE) virus was active at study areas each year and was isol=
ated
  on 22 occasions from pools of C. tarsalis females collected after the ver=
nal
  population peak. Seroconversions within flocks of sentinel chickens occur=
red
  after WEE virus was isolated from C. tarsalis. Limited WEE activity was
  associated with the autumnal increase in C. tarsalis abundance. A low lev=
el of
  St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus activity was detected by the seroconve=
rsion
  of sentinel chickens during late summer in both years and SLE virus was n=
ot
  isolated from mosquitoes. Initial results indicated that WEE and perhaps =
SLE
  viruses were reintroduced annually from southerly foci and were dissemina=

  virus isolation attempts using baby hamster kidney (BHK21) and Aedes albo=
pictus
  (AA) tissue cultures and suckling mice produced 308 viruses of which 243 =
(79%)
  were in the Palyam subgroup of orbiviruses. Mosquitoes and biting midges =
were
  collected at the southern sentinel herd site in January-February 1984 and
  processed for virus isolation in BHK21 and AA tissue cultures and by
  intrathoracic inoculation of A. aegypti. Totals of 14 338 ceratopogonids =
of 4
  species in 156 pools, and 9030 mosquitoes of 27 species in 232 pools, wer=
e
  processed and yielded 59 isolations. Of the 35 viruses isolated from Culi=
coides
  brevitarsis, 17 were members of the Palyam subgroup. Bovine ephemeral fev=
er
  (BEF) virus was isolated once from Anopheles bancroftii, once from C.
  brevitarsis and 17 times from cattle. Akabane virus was isolated for the =
first
  time from C. wadai, as well as a further 10 times from C. brevitarsis and=
 20
  times from cattle. Other viruses isolated from cattle included bluetongue
  serotype 1, and serotypes 5, 6 and 7 of epizootic haemorrhagic disease of=
 deer
  (EHD). A new BEF group virus, tentatively called Oak Vale, was isolated 9=
 times
  from Culex edwardsi. Of the orbiviruses, those in the Palyam subgroup wer=
e
  isolated almost exclusively in BHK21 tissue cultures but those in the
  bluetongue and EHD subgroups were isolated almost exclusively in AA cell
  cultures or after passage through Aedes aegypti. Of 22 rhabdovirus isolat=

AB: Twenty isolates of Jamestown Canyon (JC) virus were obtained from adult
  females of 5 Aedes species (A. provocans, A. intrudens, A. canadensis, A.
  aurifer and A. abserratus/punctor) collected at the Houghton Lake Wildlif=
e
  Research Area, Missaukee County, in north-central Michigan, between 1985 =
and
  1989. Fourteen were from A. provocans, and 6 were from 4 other snowmelt A=
edes
  species. One isolate of trivittatus virus (from A. excrucians) and one Ca=
che
  Valley-like virus (from A. fitchii) were also obtained. Seasonal successi=
on
  patterns for numerous mosquito species (e.g. the Aedes species mentioned =
above,
  A. vexans, A. cinereus, Anopheles punctipennis, Coquillettidia perturbans=
 and
  Culex pipiens/restuans) were recorded over 4 years. The temporal associat=
ion of
  adult mosquito emergence, virus isolations, and infection and seroconvers=
ion of
  sentinel deer (Odocoileus virginianus) suggest that Aedes provocans is a
  primary enzootic vector of JC virus in that focus. A. provocans provides =
an
  overwintering reservoir for JC virus at the study site. A large dry ice-b=
aited
  "tent-trap" was the most productive method for collecting numerous aedine=
 and
  other mosquito species (15 species collected, as compared to 14 with CDC =
light
  traps, 13 with aspirators, 7 on human bait and 6 by the DeFoliart-Morris =
trap).

  Breteau Index has been adopted which not only requires enumeration of pos=
itive
  breeding sites per 100 houses but also takes into account the nature of t=
hose
  sites. Thus, the most numerous sites were found to be pots of flowers, in=
doors,
  but potentially most productive for A. aegypti were water barrels and dis=
carded
  tyres outdoors. Together with ongoing surveillance of dengue virus transm=
ission
  by means of a serological sentinel system, these and other findings shoul=

  is hoped, provide an effective economical and long-lasting foundation for=
 A.

AB: The persistence of arboviruses was studied in 1983-88 in mixed agricult=
ure,
  marsh, riparian and foothill habitats in Kern County, California. Western
  equine encephalomyelitis (WEE) virus was isolated frequently during 1983 =
from
  Culex tarsalis and Aedes melanimon and was detected by the seroconversion=
 of
  sentinel chickens. WEE virus then disappeared, even though vector compete=
nce
  studies during 1984-86 showed that C. tarsalis was able to transmit WEE v=
irus.
  St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus was detected sporadically in 3 of the =
6
  years of the study by isolation from C. tarsalis and/or by sentinel chick=
en
  seroconversion. When mosquito pools were screened for virus in suckling m=
ice,
  Turlock (TUR) and Hart Park (HP) viruses were isolated from C. tarsalis d=
uring
  each summer. Vertical transmission of HP was indicated by the isolation o=
f
  virus from a pool of male C. tarsalis. California encephalitis (CE) virus=
 was
  isolated repeatedly from host-seeking A. melanimon females, males, and ad=
ults
  reared from field-collected immatures, verifying vertical transmission in
  nature. Horizontal transmission of CE virus among both jackrabbits (Lepus
  californicus) and desert cottontails (Sylvilagus auduboni) appeared to am=
plify
  A. melanimon infection rates during the summer of 1985, but elevated herd
  immunity depressed infection rates during 1986. Thus, CE, HP and TUR viru=
ses
  persisted in Kern County, while WEE virus appeared to become extinct and
  required reintroduction. The sporadic occurrence of SLE virus activity re=
mains
  unexplained, but its persistence may require both vertical transmission a=
nd
  reintroduction.

 death
  had not been determined. In Florida (see ibid., 39 (37): 650-651), 18 cas=

eak
  since 1977. Vector control measures were being intensified in Texas again=

astern
  equine encephalitis (EEE) virus in mosquitoes, birds, horses and/or man i=
n
  Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia also
  revealed unusually early activity. In Massachusetts, by 8 August 49 EEE v=
irus
  isolations had been obtained from Culiseta melanura and 1 from Coquillett=
idia
  perturbans and from 1 of 18 clinically appropriate horses in Massachusett=
s, but
  only 1 probable human infection was detected in that state, in a febrile,
  comatose child in Plymouth County, who showed rising EEE antibody levels
  commencing 16 August. In New York, EEE isolations were made from Culiseta
  morsitans, C. melanura or Aedes canadensis from 23 July onwards; sera fro=
m
  birds and horses also indicated EEE virus activity in the state, and vect=
or
  control followed. In New Jersey, EEE virus isolations from A. sollicitans=
 since
  July in all monitoring sites have indicated epidemic risk but there have =
been
  only presumptive equine and no human cases. Equine cases occurred in Geor=
gia as
  early as April, and later from Maryland and North and South Carolina. In =
South
  Carolina 1 fatal human EEE case showed onset on 1 June, and a presumptive=
 case
  in North Carolina on 1 August.

itoes
  of 67 species. There was serological evidence of dengue infection in the =
human
  population, and Aedes albopictus, a major vector, maintained its numbers =
in the
  area. A few settlers had Wuchereria bancrofti infections (probably acquir=
ed
  elsewhere), and there was a 48% increase in the numbers of Culex
  quinquefasciatus resting in houses, but no W. bancrofti larvae were found=
 in
  >4000 females dissected. An average of 18% of the records at outpatient c=
linics
  in the area were due to malaria infections. The numbers of Anopheles annu=
laris,
  An. culicifacies and An. subpictus increased, and some females of all 3 s=
pecies
  tested positive for sporozoite antigens of Plasmodium falciparum and P. v=
ivax.
  Numbers of Cx. fuscocephala, Cx. tritaeniorhynchus and Mansonia uniformis=
 all
  increased. Japanese B encephalitis (JBE) virus was isolated from females =
of the
  last 2 species, and seroconversion occurred both in sentinel pigs and in =
human
  settlers in the area. The numbers of Cx. gelidus, however, another known =
vector

  1986 to March 1989 inclusive. The dusk index is defined as the average nu=
mber
  of vector females captured per man-hour in the hour following sunset,
  multiplied by the proportion parous. When used routinely in combination w=
ith
  sentinel animal studies (using donkeys) for surveillance in villages with=
 a

AB: The feasibility of the sterile insect method (SIRM) was tested against
  natural populations of C. bezziana in the Mussa Valley, Papua New Guinea.
  Sterile mating frequencies were determined from egg masses laid by native
  females on wounded sentinel cattle. The aerial release of sterilized pupa=
ria
  resulted in low frequencies of sterile matings and few trap recaptures of
  released material. The release of chilled adult flies resulted in higher
  frequencies of sterile matings and many trap recaptures. The mean density=
 of
  males released was 230 males per km2 per week over a target area of 361 k=
m2
  (48% of the valley). Sterile masses were first detected 2 weeks after the
  release of chilled flies commenced, reaching a weekly peak of 33% after 5=
 weeks
  of releases, with 15% of egg masses found to be sterile during the final =
month.
  The levels of sterile matings achieved in this trial were similar to comp=
arable

  Statistics. Data analysis was conducted by computer using the SAS statist=

  package. Of the 1428 case files indicating pesticide as the primary subst=
ance
  of exposure to Minnesota residents, a mean age of 5 years (range, 1 month=
 to 85
  years) was identified; 50% of all cases were below age 3 years. Males acc=
ounted
  for 1.3 times as many cases as females. Insecticide was identified in the
  largest percentage of case files (74%), followed by herbicide (12%),
  rodenticide (11%) and fungicide (non-medicinal) (3%). Ingestion was the m=
ost
  common route of exposure; 85% of all cases originated from a residence. W=
hile
  insecticides are still the most common types of pesticide call, herbicide=
 has
  surpassed insecticide in production and sales in the US. In this study,
  herbicide type exposure calls presented a much different picture than oth=
er
  pesticide types. The usefulness of poison control centers for examination=
 of
  pesticide poisoning is explored. Since reporting occurs coincidental with=
 the
  exposure and its associated symptoms, each pesticide poisoning report cou=
ld
  potentially serve as a true sentinel health event.

AB: With the current decentralization of health care in the Mexican state o=
f
  Guerrero, there is a need for detailed but inexpensive information for th=
e
  planning of health services. A cyclical process of measurement is propose=
d
  using sentinel sites, characterized as places of concentration of measure=
ment
  resources, which are not special intervention areas or health facilities.=
 The
  sites in Guerrero were selected to be representative of the health condit=
ions
  in rural and urban areas of the state. During the first two years, study =
cycles
  were carried out regarding acute respiratory infections and diarrhoea in
  infants, the risk factors associated with these afflictions and the atten=
tion
  paid to them within the community. Later cycles focussed on the importanc=
e of
  scorpion stings and Chagas' disease, the impact of measles vaccination an=
d the
  prevalence of tuberculosis. Three types of community-based data are consi=
dered
  in each cycle (impact, coverage and costs) to optimize their use in plann=
ing
  which, in summary formats, facilitate rapid analysis and presentation.

PY: 1990
LA: English
AB: The Kagera region (population, 1.3 million) lies in the north-west corn=
er of
  Tanzania, sharing borders with Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi. Kagera region
  reported the first cases of AIDS in Tanzania in 1983 and has accounted fo=
r one
  -half of all national reported cases despite representing less than one-t=
enth
  of the total population. These alarming figures motivated a regional
  seroprevalence study in 1987.The region was divided into 4 zones (strata)=
 on
  the basis of distance from the regional capital Bukoba. Multi-level clust=
er
  sampling was used in which each household within each zone had an equal c=
hance
  of inclusion in the sample. From each selected household, 1 adult (15-54 =
years)
  and 1 child (0-14 years) were selected at random. Blood specimens were te=
sted
  for HIV-1 antibodies by ELISA with confirmatory testing of ELISA-positive
  specimens by Western blot. Adults were interviewed to obtain information =
on
  possible HIV risk factors in the 8-year period before the survey.In Bukob=
a town
  24% of the adults tested had HIV-1 antibodies. The seroprevalence rate in=
 the 2
  adjoining districts was 10% and fell to 0.4% in the 2 most isolated distr=
icts.
  Each of these figures is based on 535-671 specimens. In Bukoba town the
  prevalence was highest (31%) in those aged 25-34 years, and was markedly =
higher
  in females (29%) than in males (17%). The same age-group was at highest r=
isk in
  rural areas but here no sex difference in prevalence was observed. Omitti=
ng
  children aged <1 year (who may carry passively acquired antibodies), 8 (2=
.4%)
  of 330 children in, and 7 (0.5%) of 1415 children outside, Bukoba town ap=
pear
  to be infected. Risk factors for HIV-1 infection in urban and rural adult=
s were
  "more-than-one sexual partner" and "injections". "Travelling out of regio=
n" and
  "blood transfusion" were risk factors in rural adults only.[This high
  prevalence of HIV-1 infection will be profoundly disturbing to those
  responsible for health services in the region. The epidemic already appea=
rs to
  have a grip in Bukoba town and its environs (the situation 4 years on may=
 be
  significantly worse). That a low prevalence is seen in children attests t=
o a
  recent, rapid spread of the virus (unless vertical transmission is less l=
ikely
  than current estimates). This finding emphasizes the need for assiduous
  sentinel or other surveillance and for prompt intervention to limit the s=
pread
  of the epidemic.In common with many other African serosurveys, the highes=
t
  level of HIV infection was found in the urban population. Prevalence fell=
 with
  increasing distance from Bukoba town. The obvious and most plausible
  explanation is the lack of population movement to and from the capital in=
 a
  region where transport is difficult. Mobile rural residents were at highe=
r risk
  of infection than their stable counterparts.The sex difference in prevale=
nce is
  interesting and has been commonly, but not universally, observed in other
  studies. This difference may reflect that male-to-female transmission is =
more
  efficient than vice versa. The higher prevalence in persons receiving
  injections does not imply that contaminated needles are an important mode=
 of
  transmission. Parenteral antibiotics are the standard treatment for sexua=
lly
  transmitted diseases and these may merely be a marker for sexual activity=
.Two
  minor technical criticisms of the study are (i) the confidence limits aro=
und
  the prevalence rates are too narrow as they fail to consider the use of c=
luster
  sampling, (ii) by selecting 2 rather than all individuals in selected
  households, small households are over-represented in the sample. The auth=
ors
  should also have reported the extent of refusal to give a blood specimen.=

  as sentinel animals on the ground at a corner of Hitsujiyama Park, Chichi=
bu
  City, Saitama Prefecture, in November 1985.From a wild rodent Apodemus
  speciosus captured around the spots, engorged larvae of L. pallidum were
  collected and successfully reared by feeding on fresh eggs of Collembola.=
 Four
  laboratory colonies (I-IV family lines) of L. pallidum positive for Karp =
type
  of Rt were established, and vertical transmission of Rt was examined from=
 the
  parental generation (P) to F3 in these family lines by isolating Rt from
  individual mites through the passage into mice.From F1 to F3 in 4 family =
lines,
  a total of 115 unfed larvae, 53 adult females and 51 adult males were exa=
mined
  for Rt. Only 6 males were negative and all the others were positive for R=
t. The
  rates of transovarial transmission of Rt from P to F1, F1 to F2, and F2 t=
o F3
  generations were 100%, and filial infection rates of their offsprings wer=
e
  nearly 100%.Spermatophores from infected males were examined for Rt and a=
ll of
  78 spermatophores were negative for Rt. Furthermore, each of 7 Rt-positiv=
e
  males was mated with each of 7 Rt-negative females, and a total of 227 un=
fed
  larvae were obtained from these females. They were examined for Rt, but R=
t was
  not isolated or detected from any of these larvae.From these results, the
  transmission dynamics of Rt was considered that Rt-positive males did not=
 play
  any significant role in vertical transmission of Rt, but Rt was transmitt=

AB: In this paper the author, Chief of Surveillance for the World Health
  Organization's Global Programme on AIDS (GPA) summarizes surveillance of =
AIDS
  and HIV infections from the GPA's point of view. The article covers the b=
road
  aspects of case definitions for AIDS and case reporting including accurac=
y,
  completeness and timeliness. For surveillance of HIV infections, there is=
 a
  simple and clear discussion of the objectives and methods of different te=
sting
  schemes. Included is a section on the sensitivity, specificity and predic=
tive
  value of testing and the relative advantages and disadvantages of using l=
inked
  and unlinked specimens for surveillance purposes. Some examples of the
  participatory biases introduced by voluntary testing are given. In summar=
y, the
  author suggests a continuation of AIDS case reporting but notes its limit=
ed
  value for public health planning. For HIV surveillance, which is more use=
ful to
  planning efforts, sentinel surveillance of risk groups, particularly by
  unlinked anonymous screening, is advocated.[This article provides a clear=
 and
  well written broad overview of the topic. It will be mostly useful for po=
licy
  makers who want to have a veneer of understanding of the various ways the
  epidemic is monitored. However, for those actively running or contemplati=
ng
  running a surveillance system, the article provides little detailed
  information. Case definitions and methods of determining accuracy, comple=
teness
  and timeliness of reporting are not given. Techniques for establishing an=
d
  evaluating sentinel systems are only fleetingly described. However, refer=
ences
  are given (including some WHO unpublished documents) for those wishing to
  pursue some of these details.]Seth Berkley.=20

AB: The rationale for HIV-surveillance programmes stems from our realizatio=
n
  that, contrary to many other infectious diseases with short incubation pe=
riods,
  reported AIDS cases do not accurately reflect levels of HIV infection. Th=
is is
  so for several reasons: (a) the median time between the onset of HIV-infe=
ction
  and the first clinical signs of AIDS may be as long as 10 years. Therefor=
e many
  infected persons have not yet developed AIDS, and reported AIDS cases are=
 more
  likely to represent HIV-transmission patterns of the previous decade rath=
er
  than the present situation. (b) In spite of the continuous improvement of=
 case
  reporting there are still cases that go undetected as HIV-infected indivi=
duals
  may die of other causes before developing AIDS. (c) The incubation time t=
o
  develop AIDS may lengthen as effective therapeutic interventions for HIV
  -infected persons become more widely used.In 1987 the Centers for Disease
  Control (CDC), in collaboration with State and local health departments, =
other
  Federal agencies, blood-collection agencies and medical research institut=
ions,
  initiated a national sentinel surveillance system for HIV infection. This
  surveillance system, known as the CDC Family of HIV Seroprevalence Survey=
s,
  uses standardized survey and HIV serological testing procedures in sentin=
el
  populations from all over the USA to assess the spread of HIV-infection a=
cross
  the country. A comprehensive overview of the results of the studies is gi=
ven in
  this special section.The US programme is the largest and most ambitious o=
f its
  kind and therefore both the strength and the limitations of this method o=
f
  surveillance in selected target populations should be assessed from the U=
S
  experience. The CDC Family of Seroprevalence Surveys includes (a) those p=
eople
  assumed to be at increased risk (attenders of STD clinics, i.v. drug trea=
tment
  centres, tuberculosis clinics); (b) sentinel populations of special publi=
c
  -health significance (family planning, prenatal care and abortion clinics=
); (c)
  sentinel populations for whom access to data is easy or who are routinely=
 HIV
  screened (hospital patients, prison inmates, applicants to military servi=
ce,
  blood donors, university health clinics); (d) those assumed to be at low =
risk
  (childbearing women/newborn infants).The strength of these methods is tha=
t for
  the first time data are available from a variety of sentinel populations =
in
  various areas in the USA. The findings have already documented the need f=
or
  local interventions. The methods also have serious limitations, as has be=
en
  outlined by the Committee on AIDS Research and the Behavioural Social and
  Statistical Sciences (US National Research Council): "With the exception =
of the
  newborn survey, the clinics, centers and hospitals ... have been purposiv=
ely
  selected to facilitate public health management of the epidemic and many =
survey
  sites have been chosen because they serve populations that are presumed t=
o be
  especially vulnerable to infection (or because of their expressed willing=
ness
  to cooperate with CDC, LHL). Such purposive selection, however, compromis=
es the
  usefulness of the data for estimating prevalence and incidence in any wel=
l
  -defined population of interest. With the exception of the survey of newb=
orns,
  the Committee finds that none of these surveys (as currently designed) wi=
ll
  provide estimates of HIV prevalence that can be generalized with known ma=
rgins
  of error to the population group of interest (e.g. all clients of STD cli=
nics
  or patients at general hospitals). It is likely, however, that some or al=
l of
  these surveys can be augmented so as to become probability samples. In su=
ch
  augmented surveys, the present clinics or hospitals included in the surve=
ys
  would constitute one stratum in a stratified probability sample of genera=
l
  hospitals, STD clinics, and so on."The reformulation of the CDC Family of
  Seroprevalence Surveys as probability samples of clinics will require muc=
h
  effort, but seems feasible. Without additional studies of this kind estim=
ates
  of HIV-seroprevalence in populations outside these clinics actually sampl=
ed
  will remain a matter of debate, in the absence of empirical evidence. In =
the
  meantime estimates should be made, in well-defined regions, of the degree=
 of
  bias likely to have been introduced by the present selective sampling met=
hods.
  It may well prove to be of little practical importance in some regions.L.=

AB: Data describing mosquito and arbovirus activity in southern California =
in
  1987 are summarized. Culex tarsalis was the most abundant and widespread
  species of mosquito in irrigated agricultural valleys and was focally abu=
ndant
  in residual riparian and marsh habitats in the Los Angeles basin. Floodwa=
ter
  Aedes and Psorophora spp. were not abundant and were restricted to land t=
hat
  had been flood irrigated for agriculture. C. quinquefasciatus and, to a l=
esser
  extent C. peus [?C. stigmatosoma], replaced C. tarsalis in dairy or resid=
ential
  settings where larval habitats were restricted to polluted or peridomesti=
c
  sites. C. erythrothorax was only abundant at marshes supporting dense sta=
nds of
  cattails (Typha spp.). Mosquito activity was bimodal, with peaks in sprin=
g and
  late summer/early autumn. Western equine encephalitis (WEE) virus was act=
ive
  along the Colorado River and in the Coachella Valley with 62 isolations m=
ade
  between 14 January and 19 August, and 37 of 182 sentinel chickens (20%)
  converting serologically. With the exception of one isolation from C.
  quinquefasciatus, all isolations of WEE virus were made from C. tarsalis.=
 St.
  Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus was isolated from Mecca in the Coachella V=
alley,
  Seeley in Imperial Valley and the Sepulveda Basin in Los Angeles County. =
The
  isolation of SLE virus from C. tarsalis in February and the seroconversio=
n of
  sentinel chickens in December suggest that SLE virus may remain active in=
 its
  primary C. tarsalis-bird cycle throughout the winter. It is concluded tha=
t C.
  tarsalis is the primary vector of WEE virus and perhaps of SLE virus in
  southern California.

  systems were: sentinel chickens, sentinel pigeons and feral birds. Flocks=
 of 25
  white leghorn chickens and 30 pigeons were housed in chicken wire cages, =
while
  feral birds were collected in Australian crow traps with the size of the
  aperture reduced to exclude large birds. No feral birds produced antibodi=
es to
  SLE virus in Los Angeles county at the sites where the 3 different system=
s were
  located. It was unclear whether this was due to the lower level of virus
  activity or due to the low numbers of feral birds bled. In contrast, posi=
tive
  serologies for SLE virus were found in both pigeons and feral birds in Or=
ange
  county. The detection of antibodies to SLE virus in feral birds and pigeo=
ns may
  indicate that these 2 systems are more sensitive than sentinel chickens, =
in
  which no antibodies were detected. It is suggested that feral birds may b=

  largely by environmental measures (ditching, the use of sluice gates, blo=
cking
  marshes from tides) and by oiling, and concentrated largely on salt marsh
  mosquito species. Since WW2, chemical control has become the mainstay of
  mosquito control operations, although DDT was last used in 1960 and incre=
asing
  environmental awareness has led to strict policing of insecticide usage.
  Currently a mixture of water management techniques and larviciding are us=
ed,
  and experiments on viral sampling (including the use of sentinel flocks, =
CDC
  and New Jersey light traps and pigeon traps) and pesticide usage are perf=
ormed.

AB: In the autumn of 1982, the state of Utah (USA) received record levels o=
f
  precipitation, which led to concern about increased breeding of Culex tar=
salis
  and the possibility of an outbreak of western equine encephalitis (WEE). =
For
  this reason a WEE surveillance scheme using flocks of sentinel chickens w=
as set
  up. Record or higher-than-average levels of rainfall continued from 1983
  through 1986, and seroconversions in the sentinel chickens in these years=
 are
  briefly discussed. In 1987 precipitation was below average, although 5 ch=
ickens
  seroconverted to WEE virus. In 1988, there had been no seroconversions in
  chickens by 22 August. During these 6 years of surveillance, over 16 000 =
sera
  were tested; only 18 seroconversions were detected in chickens, 13 for WE=
E
  virus and 5 for St. Louis encephalitis virus (the first records of this v=
irus
  in Utah) and no human or equine cases occurred.

AB: The difference in operational efficacy of malathion and Scourge [resmet=

  + piperonyl butoxide] applied aerially (malathion (91%) at 3oz/acre, Scou=
rge at
  0.6 oz plus 2.4 oz soybean oil (3 oz/acre) or at 0.6 oz plus 4.4 oz soybe=
an oil
  (5 oz/acre)) against adults of A. sollicitans was compared to their relat=
ive
  toxicity as determined by topical application of the insecticides to a
  laboratory strain of A. sollicitans (originally isolated from West Creek,=
 Ocean
  County, New Jersey, in 1984) in 1985 and 1986. The efficacies of the fiel=
d
  applications were determined by the use of sentinel cages and in situ
  collection of female mosquitoes at the spray sites. Results of the in sit=
u
  sampling showed that malathion was more effective than Scourge (40-92% vs=
. 0
  -55%, respectively, depending on date and location). It is concluded that
  although Scourge has a lower LD99 than malathion in laboratory bioassays
  against A. sollicitans (3.4 ng/female and 12.6 ng/female respectively), i=
t is
  less efficient when used as a ULV spray in the field because a droplet of
  malathion contains more active ingredient than a droplet of Scourge of th=
e same
  diameter (a 100=B5m of malathion contains _ 587 ng a.i. while one of Scou=
rge
  contains 19 ng of a.i.); as droplets of 5-25 =B5m are thought to be optim=
al in
  terms of bouyancy and their ability to impact on flying mosquitoes, a mos=
quito
  is more likely to acquire a lethal dose encountering an aerial ULV spray =
of
  malathion than one of Scourge. The knockdown effect of Scourge may also p=
lay a
  role, as quick knockdown would essentially remove mosquitoes from further
  contact with a ULV spray. Indirect evidence is cited to support this theo=
ry:
  knockdown often results in leg fracture, and upon entering areas sprayed =
a day
  or 2 previously, the authors observed numerous females of A. sollicitans =
with
  leg fracture flying and host-seeking.

red on
  a weekly basis with CDC traps baited with dry ice in 3 ecosystems (an Atl=
antic
  White Cedar swamp, a mature White Pine stand and a mixed hardwood forest)=
 in
  Cape May County, New Jersey, where eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) viru=
s was
  known to be active. Traps were placed at ground level and 20 ft up in the
  canopy, and sentinel flocks of 5 chickens each were similarly stationed a=
nd
  bled once weekly from June through October for evidence of seroconversion=
 to
  EEE or Highlands J (HJ) virus. Of 3081 C. melanura collected, 1368 were t=
aken
  in the hardwood forest, 1243 in the cedar swamp and 470 in the pine stand=
. Most
  host seeking took place in the canopy in all 3 habitats, and seroconversi=
ons to
  both EEE and HJ virus were found predominantly in canopy stationed birds.=
 This
  canopy feeding behaviour may explain the poor performance of ground stati=
oned
  chickens in areas of New Jersey where EEE virus is known to be active.

AB: The results of a field trial of the sterile insect release method for t=
he
  control of C. bezziana are described. The trial was conducted in the Safi=
a
  Valley, Papua New Guinea, during August-September 1989 (although original=
ly
  planned for 6 months, the trial had to be abandoned 5 weeks after the fir=
st
  release due to civil unrest in the valley). Aerial releases involved twic=
e
  -weekly releases of fluorescently-marked sterilized flies. Swormlure-bait=
ed
  traps and sentinel cattle served to monitor fly numbers. A total of 9 rel=
eases
  was possible before the trial ended. During this period, 1.07 million ste=
rile
  male flies were released over the valley at an average of 309 males/km2/w=
eek.
  On average, 13 native female C. bezziana were trapped each week during th=
e 6
  weeks that trapping was possible. During this time only one native male f=
ly was
  trapped. Only one trapping period was possible after the start of release=
s.
  During this week, 49 female and 14 male flies from the first 2 releases a=
nd 5
  females and one male from the 3rd release were recaptured. Before the rel=
eases
  started, 163 egg masses were collected, of which one was sterile. From th=
e day
  of the first release (7th August) until the trial ended, 144 egg masses w=
ere
  recorded in 3 trapping periods. No sterile egg masses were found in the f=
irst
  10 days after releases commenced. After this, it was not possible to moni=
tor
  sentinel cattle until 8-11 days after releases ceased. During this period=
, 87
  egg masses were collected, of which 25 were sterile. Despite the problems
  encountered during the trial, the author concludes that the data show tha=
t
  sterile insect release has the potential to be effective in controlling C=
.
  bezziana populations.

AB: The screw worm fly, Cochliomyia hominovorax, has now been eradicated fr=
om
  the southern USA and the whole of Mexico by the release of sterile males.=
 It is
  intended to continue the eradication southward to Panama. The flies are
  sparsely distributed and attractants are needed to study them, including =
the
  monitoring of the percentage sterility in eggs laid by wild females in
  populations subject to sterile male release. Wounded sheep have tradition=
ally
  been used to attract flies but it is desirable to replace that method. A
  synthetic attractant known as "sworm lure" was effective in temperate and=
 sub
  -tropical areas but is ineffective in the tropics.The paper reports compa=
risons
  of numbers and gonotrophic state of flies caught on wounded sheep or in t=
raps
  baited with rotted liver, fish or fruit. The latter 2 were respectively
  inferior and totally ineffective as attractants. However, the liver captu=
red
  numbers of females not significantly different from sheep. Numbers of mal=
es
  captured were low but were, in 1 case, significantly greater on liver tha=
n
  sheep. The gonotrophic condition of the female flies suggested that they
  approached liver mainly to feed, but they approached sheep to oviposit.
  However, it is considered that mated females captured on liver, and which=
 were
  at an early stage of ovarian development, could be held in captivity unti=
l they
  reach a stage at which they could be stimulated to oviposit.C.F. Curtis=

AB: An overview of the circulation of St. Louis encephalitis (SLE), eastern
  equine encephalitis (EEE), western equine encephalitis (WEE), Mucambo (MU=
C) and
  Pixuna (PIX) viruses in Brazilian Amazonia during 1959-87 is presented. I=
nsects
  were caught on human bait and in CDC light traps, and blood samples taken=
 from
  forest animals in areas characterized by road-building and development
  projects. EEE and WEE viruses were detected by serological techniques
  (haemagglutination inhibition, complement fixation and neutralization), w=
hile
  SLE and MUC were detected by either serology or by virus isolation (using
  neonate Swiss white mice). The results are tabulated, with information on
  vertebrate or insect host, location and date of isolation. PIX virus was
  isolated from mosquitoes (Trichoprosopon digitatum and Anopheles nimbus) =
on the
  Brasilia-Belem road and from the viscera of Proechimys guyannensis caught=
 near
  Belem; the single human infection (acquired in 1961) is thought to have b=
een
  contracted in the laboratory. Antibodies to SLE virus were detected in 86
  species of birds, giving a total prevalence of 3.4% for the 11 643 birds
  tested; SLE virus was isolated 35 times from mosquitoes (mostly from Cule=
x
  coronator and C. declarator - these 2 species accounted for 5 and 12 of t=
he
  isolations, respectively), once from an armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) =
and
  from the turtles Chelonoidis carbonaria and C. denticulata. MUC virus was
  isolated from forest animals (mostly rodents) a total of 43 times, and fr=
om
  mosquitoes (and, in 1 case, Simulium sp.) 26 times. EEE virus was isolate=
d from
  forest birds 7 times and from mosquitoes 40 times; Culex pedroi and Culex=
 sp.
  accounted for 21 and 12 of these isolates, respectively. WEE virus was de=
tected
  in the sera of 6 species of forest birds and isolated from 3 mosquitoes a=
nd a
  sentinel mouse. These data are discussed in relation to previously publis=
hed
  data on the circulation of arboviruses in the human population in Amazoni=
a, and
  the symptoms caused by these arboviruses in Brazilian patients are compar=
ed to
  those caused by the same viruses in other parts of the Americas, especial=
ly the
  USA.

any

  vector). Serum samples taken during 1974 and 1978 showed evidence of epiz=
ootic
  Rift Valley fever in Zambia, with more than 80% positive. A sentinel herd
  exposed from 1982 to 1986 showed that some Rift Valley fever occurred eac=
h
  year. This was usually at a low level, with 3-8% of the susceptible cattl=
e
  seroconverting. In 1985-86 more than 20% of the animals seroconverted, an=
d this
  greater activity was associated with vegetational changes (which could be
  detected by remote-sensing satellite imagery) which have also been associ=
ated
  with greater virus activity in Kenya.

AB: A total 3011 canine sera from 32 practices in Massachussets were analys=
ed by
  ELISA for antibody to Borrelia burgdorferi. Regression analysis between t=
he
  mean incidence in man (1985-89) and the canine seroprevalence (July 1989-=
August
  1989) revealed that the canine seroprevalence was highly predictive of
  incidence (P <0.0001). Factors predictive of seropositivity were dogs res=
ident
  at less than 200 feet above sea level (perhaps reflecting the humidity ne=
eded
  to maintain deer ticks), sporting or large mixed breeds, and an age older=
 than
  2 years (reflecting duration of disease).There was no peak in the number =
of
  cases during the spring or autumn. The authors suggest that dogs may prov=
ide a
  better estimate of environmental risk of Lyme disease, as measures to dec=
rease
  response to ticks may be more effective in man than in animals. Furthermo=
re, if
  blood samples are taken routinely, as they were in their study, from all
  animals attending the practice, then factors such as "increased awareness=
" play
  no part in estimating prevalence. [There was an underlying assumption in =
this
  respect that the ELISA used has a low false-positivity rate and that the =
dogs
  were not infected when taken on holidays by their owners. The recent
  availability of a dog vaccine (if taken up) may alternatively nullify suc=
h
  studies in future. It should be noted that seroprevalence in dogs tends t=
o be
  greater than in man, partly because the totality of the dog populations i=

  chickens did not contain detectable IgM 30 days after infection. Similarl=
y, in
  all 3 naturally infected sentinel chickens from Maryland, USA, IgM class
  antibody was undetectable 1 to 5 weeks after IgM was initially detected. =
EIAs

AB: The Indian River Mosquito Control District (IRMCD) has cooperated in a =
St.
  Louis encephalitis (SLE) sentinel chicken surveillance programme since 19=
78.
  Absent or minimal levels of SLE activity were recorded from 1978 to 1988.=
 In
  1989 an unusually large number of seroconversions were confirmed. The 198=
9
  seroconversions, while below levels that trigger various alerts, resulted=
 in a
  major review of IRMCD policy and strategy related to sentinel chicken
  seroconversions. These 1989 seroconversions proved to serve as an early w=
arning
  for 1990, when the most recent Florida SLE epidemic erupted with its epic=
enter
  in Indian River County. While providing invaluable information for epidem=
ic
  response, vector [Culex nigripalpus] control and comparative long-term da=
ta for
  future predictions, several obstacles were encountered in managing the ch=
icken
  flocks during the epidemic. These difficulties included: SLE infections o=
f
  chickens prior to placement in the field, high chicken mortality rates,
  maintaining sufficient chickens in the field to give meaningful data, and
  proper and timely interpretation of seroconversion results.

iasis
  were conducted periodically on resident herds in the Biological Control o=
f
  Tsetse (BICOT) Project area in Lafia, Plateau State, Nigeria, using stand=

  detection methods. Over a specified period, sentinel herds were also exam=
ined
  in selected locations within the project area. Fly trapping and dissectio=
n were
  similarly used for trypanosome screening of wild and released flies. In b=
oth
  resident and sentinel herds, infections were detected consistently, showi=
ng the
  persistence of the disease throughout the period of survey. Fly trapping =
and
  dissection revealed that the target species, Glossina palpalis palpalis, =
was
  effectively eliminated from the control zone, or may be persisting only a=
t an
  undetectable level. However, G. tachinoides was present in most of these =
areas
  and may therefore have been responsible for the persistence of infection
  (Trypanosoma congolense, T. vivax or T. brucei). Infection among resident=
 herds
  could have also been due to their migratory activities, taking them to ar=
eas
  outside the control project.

AB: St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus has become established in the Los An=
geles
  Basin of California, USA, where it most likely is maintained by horizonta=
l
  transmission among Culex tarsalis and passerine birds in park-riparian ha=
bitat.
  Viral transmission also was detected at low levels in residential habitat=
 by
  the infrequent seroconversion of sentinel chickens. SLE virus activity wa=
s
  documented in all months except March and April. C. tarsalis was incrimin=
ated
  as the primary vector, based on elevated field infection rates (0.17 infe=
cted
  females per 1000 tested), population abundance concomitant in time and sp=
ace
  with increased SLE virus activity, vector competence, and vectorial capac=
ity.
  C. stigmatosoma also may be important in the horizontal maintenance of SL=
E
  virus because this species was an efficient laboratory vector, fed freque=
ntly
  on passeriform birds, and had field infection rates (0.15 females per 100=
0)
  comparable with C. tarsalis. However, difficulty in trapping adult female=
s
  precluded the assessment of C. stigmatosoma because abundance may have be=
en
  underestimated and comparatively few females were tested for virus. Altho=
ugh C.
  quinquefasciatus was the most abundant species in residential habitats (>=
85% of
  total catch at CO2 traps) where it occasionally fed on humans (0.6% of to=
tal
  tested), this species was considered to be of secondary importance becaus=
e
  field infection rates were low (0.03 females per 1000) and few females be=
came
  infected and transmitted SLE virus in laboratory vector competence experi=
ments.
  Although C. erythrothorax fed on humans in marsh habitat (5% of total tes=
ted),
  this species infrequently fed on birds (12%) and was refractory to SLE vi=
rus
  infection in vector competence experiments; therefore, it was not conside=
red a
  vector of SLE virus. Future SLE virus surveillance and mosquito control
  programmes should be directed toward C. tarsalis populations.

  and the clinical, epidemiological and virological data obtained from 1752
  documented cases. The epidemic reached its peak in February in Tahiti Isl=
and, 7
  weeks after its recognition. Among 6034 suspect cases reported by "sentin=
el
  physicians", 60.3% were <20 years old. The illness was classical dengue. =
No
  fatality or case of dengue haemorrhagic fever/dengue with shock syndrome =
was
  reported. Of 4792 patients subjected to laboratory testing, 41% were conf=
irmed
  as positive. The serological attack rate was ca. 40%. The estimated numbe=
r of
  dengue infections in the Windward Islands was about 20 000. Transmission =
was
  associated with Aedes aegypti. Study of documented cases showed a higher
  confirmation rate in both the civilian population <15 years old (46.5%) a=
nd the
  susceptible French military population (47.6%) than in older civilians (3=
1.1%,
  P<0.05). Furthermore, primary dengue infections were predominant in both =
the
  first 2 groups. The diagnosis was mostly confirmed by virus isolation on =
day <5
  of illness and by detection of IgM on day _5 of illness. The study showed=
 that
  adequate surveillance of an epidemic requires both clinically and laborat=
ory
  -based systems.

TI: Heligmosomoides polygyrus (Nematoda): susceptible and resistant strains=
 of
  mice are indistinguishable following natural infection.
AU: Scott-ME
AD: Institute of Parasitology, McGill University, Macdonald Campus, 21 111

SO: Parasitology. 1991, 103: 3, 429-438; 17 ref.
PY: 1991
LA: English
AB: BALB/c mice were characterized as more resistant to infection with H.
  polygyrus than C57BL/6 mice based on lower establishment and survival dur=
ing a
  primary infection and stronger protection induced by an immunizing regime=
. It
  was hypothesized, therefore, that C57BL/6 mice would be more heavily infe=
cted
  than BALB/c mice when they lived together as a single population in a lar=
ge
  indoor arena where transmission occurred through contact between the mice=
 and
  damp peat trays where parasite eggs developed into larvae. 50 female mice
  (including 5 infected mice) of each strain were placed in a 3.2 X 0.8 m a=
rena.
  Net egg production and numbers of larvae acquired by sentinel mice of eac=
h
  strain were monitored every 2 weeks. The experiment was replicated twice.=
 The
  results did not support the hypothesis. No difference was detected betwee=
n
  strains of mice in the number of larvae acquired by sentinel mice during =
24 h
  exposure periods, or in the numbers of worms present after 12 or 23 weeks=
. Net
  egg production was also comparable between strains. A hypothesis that the
  unexpected similarity of infection in the 2 strains was related to differ=
ences
  in rates of contact with the peat trays was not supported by preliminary =
data
  on mouse behaviour that revealed equal frequency of contact with peat tra=
ys
  between strains. A 2nd hypothesis that continuous exposure to larvae led =
to
  similar infection levels in the 2 strains (in contrast to the controlled
  characterization experiments) was also unsupported. Mice were infected we=
ekly
  with 10, 50 or 100 larvae for 5 or 10 weeks. Net egg production and numbe=
rs of
  worms were consistently higher in C57BL/6 than BALB/c mice. It is not cle=
ar why
  infection in the 2 strains was virtually identical in the large arenas bu=
t
  clearly distinct in all controlled infection experiments.

been
  directed at the broad masses with emphasis on the population with high-ri=

  television). The WHO's Global Programme on AIDS provided $300 000 to help
  prevention programmes, and programmes now include the control of sexually
  transmitted diseases. The epidemiological trends of the disease remain un=

AB: "Current levels of surveillance have contributed to substantial reducti=
ons
  in morbidity and mortality due to poliomyelitis in the Americas. Despite =
the
  success of the poliomyelitis eradication initiative, it has become critic=
al
  that surveillance be intensified so that the absence of wild poliovirus
  circulation can be verified with confidence in countries not reporting
  confirmed cases of poliomyelitis. Cases of acute flaccid paralysis contin=
ue to
  be classified as compatible with poliomyelitis, because investigations of=
 such
  patients do not provide sufficient information to rule out wild polioviru=
s as
  the cause of paralysis. At this stage of the eradication initiative, the
  presence of compatible cases in some countries in Latin America indicates=
 a
  failure of the surveillance system. The greatest challenge for the eradic=
ation
  initiative may be correcting the remaining deficiencies of the existing
  surveillance system that hinder efforts to verify that wild poliovirus is=
 no
  longer being transmitted in the Americas.This report summarizes the descr=
iptive
  epidemiology of compatible poliomyelitis cases reported to the Pan Americ=
an
  Health Organization (PAHO) for 1990 and 1991, with special focus on the c=
ases
  from 1991, and describes the challenge PAHO faces in its attempts to acce=
lerate
  and strengthen surveillance activities." [Eradication of polio by 2000 is
  accompanied by 2 claims: that 85% immunization is enough and that, after
  eradication, immunization can be abandoned. Both ideas can be disputed.
  Meanwhile, the case definition of poliomyelitis has been changed to elimi=
nate
  false positives. Some of the references in this report are to unrefereed
  documents and for those which are published there is no cross-referencing=
 (for
  example to a paper by the same authors in Bulletin of the WHO, 1992, 70, =
79
  -84). The annual incidence may be per 100 000 inhabitants or only those u=
nder
  15 yr; patients may be considered only if <10 yr or <6 yr. For 1990 and 1=
991
  there were 100 patients deemed as having "compatible poliomyelitis" of wh=
om 22
  died. In severe polio epidemics in temperate countries the case-fatality =
rate
  was about 10% for young children and in India of 175 081 cases of acute p=
olio
  reported from sentinel hospitals the rate was 1.85%: 22% for compatible c=
ases
  seems very high. There are no references to the thousands of cases of acu=
te
  flaccid paralysis which have been discarded as "not polio". It would be
  reassuring if these cases were analysed in detail and the diagnoses repor=
ted.
  It is important to see how many false negatives the new criteria conceal.=

AB: This article summarizes the conclusion of a meeting held in Monaco in
  September 1991. Standardization of influenza surveillance throughout the =
world
  is inevitably difficult because of so much variation between countries in=
 their
  virological and epidemiological facilities and expertise. A notorious pit=
fall
  is to ascribe outbreaks of "respiratory illness" to influenza in the abse=
nce of
  laboratory diagnostic confirmation. Nevertheless, up-to-date information =
on
  circulating A(H1N1), A(H3N2), and B viruses in different regions of the w=
orld
  is vital in order to map the progression of epidemics, to make comparativ=
e
  viral antigenic analyses, and to review vaccine components as early as
  possible. Selected "sentinel" physicians can report weekly on influenza-l=
ike
  illness. They become expert in detecting epidemics, and if provided with =
the
  means of specimen collection, will do much to expedite the identification=
 of
  causative viruses. They can also monitor the occurrence of influenza/pneu=
monia
  deaths and overall deaths in weekly mortality figures: these should be su=
b
  -divided according to age. In suitable countries, social security sicknes=
s
  claims and school absenteeism may be useful additional indicators. At lea=
st one
  laboratory in each country should be responsible for collating data from
  sentinel physicians and for sending representative isolates to World Heal=
th
  Organization influenza reference centres. A.S. Beare=20

  were positive for HIV-2. Prevalence varied with region and was highest (8=
 of

tion
  about 6000), and 3239 adults agreed to be tested. HIV-2 antibodies were f=
ound
  in 25 and HIV-1 antibodies in 2 (one from a man who had just returned fro=
m the
  Cote d'Ivoire), an overall seroprevalence rate of 0.8% in adults aged >20=
 years
  (the median age of the seropositive group was 39 years but 13 were aged 4=
0-68
  years). Among the married seropositives 6 of 9 couples were of discordant=
 HIV
  status. The data are consistent with the results of a national sentinel
  programme which in 1990 published data for several towns showing seroprev=
alence
  rates for HIV-2 of 20% in prostitutes, 5% in hospital patients and 2% in
  pregnant women in the main town of Casamance whereas further north the ra=
tes
  were 7%, 1% and zero. Investigation of sera collected in the same rural z=
one of
  Casamance in 1972 revealed only one seropositive case in 1400 sera from a=
dults.
  Trade routes of Senegalese merchants to and from Central Africa have been
  documented and those have been linked with the introduction of HIV-1. [Th=
e
  implication from the data is that HIV-2 was introduced in the early 1970s=

  contrary to the view of some researchers that HIV-2 has "historically" be=

  present. The introduction of HIV-1 may result in that virus spreading mor=
e
  rapidly than HIV-2 as appears to have happened in Cote d'Ivoire and Niger=
. This
  has serious consequences as a report on Senegalese prostitutes showed tha=

AB: In 1988 a national survey of HIV infection was inaugurated in the USA. =
An
  estimate of HIV seroprevalence was made on anonymous blood samples obtain=
ed
  from blood taken routinely in 98 STD clinics. The clinics included those =
with
  high and low incidence of AIDS. Data for homosexual males who denied inje=
cting
  drug use were available from 37 clinics in 27 metropolitan areas; HIV
  prevalence ranged from 14.3% to 64.2% (median 36.1%). Homosexual men who =
were
  also drug addicts showed a HIV prevalence of 69% compared with 49.9% of
  homosexual men who did not report injecting drug use in the same clinic. =
In
  heterosexual men who were injecting drug users the HIV infection rate was=
 4.1%.
  The median infection rate among heterosexual non-injecting drug users was=
 2.3%.
  In heterosexual patients who did not report risk for HIV infection the me=
dian
  rate of infection was 1.0%. HIV seroprevalence varied by age group and ge=
nder.
  In all age groups except those aged 19 years HIV rates were higher in men=
.
  Homosexual men who were not injecting drug users had HIV rates 10 to 30 t=
imes
  higher than those for heterosexual men in the same age groups. Black pati=
ents
  had significantly higher rates of infection than white patients. The vari=
ation
  of HIV prevalence depended primarily on the risk behaviour and demographi=
c
  characteristics. It is extremely important to educate all STD patients ab=
out
  HIV and to recommend voluntary HIV testing and counselling to both patien=
ts and
  their sex partners in an effort to reduce transmission of HIV infection. =

AB: Over the past decade, a vaccinia-rabies glycoprotein (V-RG) recombinant
  vaccine virus was developed for the potential control of wildlife rabies =
by
  oral immunization in baits. Before widespread field applications in diffe=
rent
  ecological settings, extensive laboratory safety testing was necessary in=
 a
  number of target and non-target species to quantify real or perceived ris=
ks and
  to monitor potential adverse health effects. To mitigate concerns over
  inadvertent human exposure to a vaccine targeted for environmental releas=
e and
  intended for wildlife consumption, it was necessary to study the safety o=
f the
  vaccine in primates following oral consumption and indirectly through
  transdermal administration. No significant differences were observed in t=
he
  comparative pathogenicity of vaccina and vaccinia-recombinant viruses by
  intradermal scarification of squirrel monkeys. In addition, 8 of 11 chimp=
anzees
  given the V-RG vaccine (109 plaque forming units/ml) by mouth developed r=
abies
  virus-neutralizing antibodies. Sentinel chimpanzee controls and human ani=
mal
  handlers did not show evidence of virus exposure. No adverse effects were=
 noted
  in any experimental animals as a result of V-RG vaccine administration.

  significantly correlated with human sentinel collections. The Fay-Prince =

  tool for estimating female activity levels. There was no significant
  correlation between the number of males captured in Fay-Prince traps and =
at

  10.9% (range 0-27.5%) in 1987 to 2.5% (range 0-14.2%) in 1988. Correlatio=
n
  analyses between the number of female copepods and fungal infection rates=
 in
  sentinel mosquitoes were significant (P>0.01) for Acanthocyclops robustus=
 but
  insignificant for 8 other species. Infections obtained in sentinel larvae
  placed in the ponds for 3-h intervals indicated that C. punctatus infecte=
d
  larvae around sundown. Infection rates for field-collected larvae increas=
ed
  with the stage of larval development. However, experiments with sentinel =
larvae
  showed that early instars were more susceptible to infection than later
  instars, suggesting that the higher infection rates in late instars resul=
ted
  from individual larvae being infected by 2 or more zygotes during larval
  development. Standard multiple regression analyses, used to determine the
  relationship between seasonal infection rates and water chemistry, weathe=
r
  variables, and the abundance of early and late instar larvae, showed that=
 the
  abundance of late instars was the only independent variable common to lin=
ear
  models. The models only accounted for 20 and 9% of the variation in larva=
l
  infection rates for 1987 and 1988, respectively. These results indicate t=
hat of
  the parameters examined, the seasonal abundance of the copepod A. robustu=
s was
  the most important factor (or variable) correlated with the prevalence of
  mosquito infection.

  studies of the diel periodicity of gametangial dehiscence in A. robustus =

  field studies on copepod abundance, susceptibility to infection, and
  periodicity of gametangial dehiscence suggested that A. robustus was the
  principal intermediate host for C. punctatus during the epizootic, though=
 it is

AB: Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus infections are usually most frequently
  reported from rural areas and relatively rarely from urban centres. This =
study
  investigated the ecology of a focus of JE virus transmission in suburban
  Bangkok (Thailand) after several cases were reported from a single area. =
The
  study showed a seasonal variation in virus incidence in Culex tritaeniorh=
ynchus
  and Cx. gelidus mosquitoes at a number of geographical sites. Virus incid=
ence
  in mosquitoes co-varied with vector abundance, and transmission indicator=
s
  peaked in the early (May-July) and late (October -November) monsoon perio=
ds.
  The risk of human infection appeared greatest at a site with moderate vec=
tor
  density but a high human population density. In addition to JE virus isol=
ates,
  14 other arbovirus isolates were obtained although identification was not
  complete. [The study underscores the risks associated with the expansion =
of
  urban populations into natural silent foci of disease transmission.]C.J. =

AB: Temporal and spatial patterns of St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus
  transmission were compared at permanent study areas in the southern San J=
oaquin
  Valley during years with low (1988 and 1990) and elevated (1989) viral
  activity. During 1989 and 1990, virus appeared first at sentinel chicken =
flocks
  exhibiting low to moderate seroconversion rates at the end of the previou=
s
  season. This finding, and the early season seroconversion of sentinel chi=
ckens
  at a marsh habitat on 5 March and 2 April 1990, circumstantially indicate=
d that
  SLE virus may have overwintered in the valley during the winters of 1988-=
89 and
  1989-90. The mechanism of overwintering was not elucidated further, becau=
se
  virus could not be isolated from overwintering adult mosquitoes or from
  immatures collected during the spring. An outbreak of 26 confirmed SLE ca=
ses
  occurred in 1989 during a drought year (rainfall 50% of normal) and follo=
wed a
  spring with elevated temperatures (1.7-3.4=B0C above normal) and Culex ta=
rsalis
  abundance. C. tarsalis was the primary vector, being most abundant during=
 the
  virus amplification period in early summer and most frequently infected (=
70 SLE
  virus positive pools/329 tested). SLE virus also was detected in C.
  quinquefasciatus (14/65) and C. stigmatosoma (1/4); however, both species=
 were
  distributed focally and increased in abundance only after widespread
  seroconversions had occurred in sentinel chickens. Increased virus activi=
ty
  during 1989 was not accompanied by marked changes in vector susceptibilit=
y or
  in SLE virus infectivity for mosquitoes. Decreased virus activity in the
  Bakersfield area during 1990 could not be attributed to immunity in passe=
riform
  birds, because a small seroprevalence survey indicated that few adult bir=
ds had
  antibodies to SLE virus.

  encephalitis (SLE) virus activity were monitored in 5 valleys in southeas=
tern
  California, USA, from June 1986 to April 1990 to study virus overwinterin=
g and
  possible dissemination from south to north along geographically defined
  corridors. Culex tarsalis predominated in CO2 trap collections and was th=
e only
  species repeatedly infected with WEE and SLE viruses. Abundance peaked du=
ring
  April-May and August-October. WEE virus infections in C. tarsalis general=
ly
  were detected after the spring peak and were followed about 1 month later=
 by
  seroconversions in sentinel chickens. SLE virus infections occurred later=
 in
  the summer but before the autumn peak in C. tarsalis abundance. Peak C.
  tarsalis abundance occurred when monthly temperatures averaged 25=B0C, wh=
ereas
  virus infections generally were detected most frequently when temperature=
s
  exceeded 29=B0C. Although the spring increase in C. tarsalis abundance oc=
curred
  earlier in southern valleys, the onset of virus activity was variable amo=
ng
  valleys and did not follow a south to north progression.

  was carried out during a Japanese encephalitis (JE) epidemic in the North
  Central province of Sri Lanka (in November-December 1987) and a subsequen=
t non
  -epidemic year (1988). The epidemic involved 361 cases of human encephali=
tis
  virologically confirmed by IgM ELISA, and was preceded 2-3 weeks earlier =
by
  sentinel pig seroconversion. Virus isolation and viral antigen detection
  (ELISA) in field-caught mosquitoes incriminated Culex tritaeniorhynchus a=
nd C.
  gelidus as the major vectors of virus transmission during the porcine
  amplification and human 'spill-over' phases of the epidemic. Virus was al=
so
  demonstrated in C. fuscocephala, C. whitmorei and Mansonia uniformis duri=
ng the
  epidemic. The major difference between the epidemic (1987) and non-epidem=
ic
  (1988) years was a lower vector biomass and lower rates of virus carriage=
 in
  the mosquito population.

AB: Data on arboviruses in Manitoba, Canada, are compiled for a 17-year per=
iod,
  1975-91. Western equine encephalitis virus is endemic in Manitoba, yet
  epidemics/epizootics develop infrequently, with 4 epidemics recorded duri=
ng the
  study period: 1975, 1977, 1981 and 1983. A multi-disciplinary surveillanc=
e was
  started in 1975 and remained active for 10 years, during which mosquito
  populations, especially those of Culex tarsalis, mosquito arboviral infec=
tion
  rates and seroconversion in sentinel chicken flocks were monitored in a n=
umber
  of locations throughout Manitoba. In addition, serosurveys were done on
  potential reservoir hosts, and serologically confirmed equine and human c=
ases
  were recorded. After 1986, the surveillance was limited to the City of Wi=
nnipeg
  data on mosquito populations and seroconversion in chicken flocks. Crude
  criteria were developed to forecast epidemics and were successful in pred=
icting
  the 1977, 1981 and 1983 outbreaks. Experience has shown that multiple
  parameters are needed for monitoring arboviral outbreaks, and that the mo=
nth of
  July is critical in predicting epidemics. It is proposed that a multi
  -disciplinary surveillance be re-instituted, and that 1-2 locations be
  monitored for mosquito populations and infection rates, as well as for
  seroconversion in chickens. If funds are limited, the surveillance could =
be
  restricted to a 4-6 week period, including the month of July.

AB: Venous blood was collected aseptically from clinically healthy domestic
  dogs, goats, sheep, cats and fowls in various plague-infested villages of
  Lushoto District, Tanzania, at the time when the disease was actively pre=
valent
  in the area. Flea ectoparasites were collected from the animals, processe=
d,
  identified and counted. Serum samples were tested for specific Yersinia p=
estis
  antibodies, using the passive haemagglutination technique and checked by
  passive haemagglutination inhibition tests. Altogether 389 animals, of wh=
ich
  201 were domestic dogs, were involved. 11 (5.5%) dogs had significantly
  elevated specific plague antibodies at titres ranging from 20 to 1280. Al=
l the
  dogs were also heavily infested with fleas at a mean index of 7.7 fleas p=
er
  animal. Of 1871 fleas collected from the dogs, 93.8% were Ctenocephalides=
 felis
  and 6.2% were C. canis. All the other animals examined were negative for
  plague. It was concluded that domestic dogs could play an important role =
as
  plague carriers in the area and that the animals could serve as sentinel
  animals for the detection of plague in villages where human plague outbre=
aks
  have not previously occurred.

AB: Many countries have influenza surveillance systems that recognize epide=
mics
  through greatly increased numbers of viral isolations. In addition there =
are
  general outbreak indicators such as school absenteeism, absence from work=
, and
  mortality rise in the population from respiratory and non-respiratory cau=
ses.
  This paper focuses on acute respiratory infection (ARI) throughout the ye=
ar: it
  almost invariably rises in the winter and its aetiology often cannot be
  determined. An index was calculated based on number of cases of ARI per 1=
00
  general practitioner (GP) consultations, averaging 10.8% for the entire y=
ear
  and 6.5% for the mid-summer months. It is suggested that continuous monit=
oring
  of this index would provide advance warning of impending influenza epidem=
ics.
  Thirty eight Belgian GPs sent weekly returns of influenza-like illness an=
d
  influenza virus isolations to a central hygiene institute: this reporting=
 was
  discontinued over 3 months in the summer period from 1989. The survey las=
ted
  from 1985 to 1990. Three epidemics were identified, 1985-86 (virus subtyp=
e not
  specified), 1988-89 (mixed virus A, H1N1 and H3N2), and 1989-90 (very lar=
ge
  H3N2 outbreak). This last epidemic coincided with one of respiratory sync=
ytial
  virus. In all the years surveyed ARI kept within an expected curve when t=
here
  was no influenza epidemic. But when there was an epidemic it was preceded=
 by
  sharply increased ARI. In 1989-90 this was seen in the 48th week of the y=
ear, 1
  week before the peak of the epidemic. ARI curves followed the same patter=
ns as
  influenza curves. In 1985-86 it affected younger age groups mainly (19-60
  years) with a lesser effect on the old (>60 years): in 1988-89 19-60 year=
 olds
  alone were attacked, and in 1989-90 both groups were attacked but the you=
nger
  people in particular. Absenteeism (based on data from railway workers) fo=
llowed
  a comparable pattern. In 1986 there were 2345 excess deaths, and in 1989-=
90
  4900 excess deaths.The authors press the case for continuous surveillance=
 of
  clinical respiratory illness throughout the year.A.S. Beare.=20

nd
  there are apparently also a number of sentinel physicians. The 2 papers p=
rovide
  data on serum surveys in 1992 and epidemics in the winter and spring of 1=
992
  -1993. In general it seems that the surveys enabled a reasonably accurate
  prediction to be made of the subsequent epidemics. In 1992, antibody
  measurement indicated overall disease susceptibility in the population as
  follows: virus B (B/Panama/45/90) 73%, virus A (H1N1) 45%, virus A (H3N2)=
 47%.
  (There had been a considerable H3N2 epidemic in 1991-1992, and a virus B
  outbreak in 1990-1991). Little influenza was seen until January 1993 when=
 there
  was an appreciable number of virus B infections. These continued into Feb=
ruary
  when they were joined by lesser numbers of A (H1N1). By March, cases of B=
 and
  H1N1 were virtually equal, and there was in addition a sprinkling of A (H=
3N2).
  Virus B declined in April and the 2 type A infections reached their peak.=
 All
  infections dropped in May although H3N2 persisted for a while. Neither vi=
rus A
  nor virus B was dominant in 1992-1993. Antigenically, most H3N2 strains w=
ere
  similar to the A/Beijing/32/92 variant of A/Beijing/353/89 and the B isol=
ates
  were mostly the B/Panama/45/90 variant of B/Yamagata/16/88. The component=
s of
  the 1992 vaccine matched those of the 1992-1993 epidemic pretty well. The=
 paper
  details methods by which infections were identified: virus isolation 60%,
  direct antigen detection 13%, and seroconversion 27%. During 1 September =
1992
  -30 June 1993, 1568 influenza cases were reported. Broken down according =
to age
  groups these were infants 13%, 1-4 years old 19%, 5-19 year olds 24%, 20-=
64
  year olds 29%, and 65 and over, 15%. The report stressed the importance o=
f
  tracking epidemics in the very young who were the first to be affected wh=

  examined during a 122-day study in a tropical dry forest in Costa Rica. F=
lies
  were marked and released. Numbers of flies visiting baits increased durin=

  wet season and decreased during the dry season; 3 times more flies were
  observed at baits during the wet season than were observed during the dry
  season. An average of 33 females and 3 males was observed per day during =
the
  study. More flies (3.6 times) were attracted to rotting liver than to sen=
tinel
  sheep; many flies originally marked at liver failed to return and few of =
them
  oviposited on sentinel sheep. Females marked at sheep remained in the stu=
dy

1%)
  than those marked at liver sites (32.3-44.7%). More than 6 times as many =
flies

 the
  female influenced daily activity. High temperatures during midday (>31=B0=

  depressed activity and decreased the number of foraging hours available f=

AB: A 60 Gy gamma treatment administered to females of G. austeni on day 2 =

  following emergence, and likewise, a 50 Gy gamma treatment given to pupae=
 on
  day 33 following larviposition, induced complete sterility in the female =
flies
  without altering their mating behaviour. Treated females remained recepti=
ve to
  mating with untreated males up to 15 days following emergence (mating res=
ponse
  of 84%). The timing of treatment (on day 33 post larviposition, on day 2 =
and 9
  following emergence) influenced significantly the dynamics of follicle
  development. Females, irrespective of their age when treatment was receiv=
ed,
  showed a normal development pattern of the follicles in position A1 and C=
1,
  i.e. normal vitellogenesis, maturation and ovulation. Female treated as p=
upae,
  however, revealed no visible signs of a development of follicles in posit=
ion B1
  and D1. From day 15 on, females displayed inactive ovaries characterized =
by
  atrophied oocytes and nurse cells. Treating females on day 2 or 9 of thei=
r
  adult life resulted in various degrees of development of the B1 and D1
  follicles. During laboratory cage tests, untreated males exposed to equal
  numbers of virgin untreated and treated females, showed no significant
  preference to mating with either type of female. A high degree of multipl=
e
  mating was observed when untreated and treated females were offered sever=
al
  mating opportunities. On day 9 following emergence, 24.0% of untreated an=
d
  23.8% of females treated with 60 Gy (on day 2), accepted a male during a =
4th
  mating occasion. The receptivity to remating decreased with a higher radi=
ation
  dose (120 Gy) and when treatment was given later in the female life (day =
5).
  The results of the laboratory experiments are discussed in view of deploy=
ing
  gamma sterilized female G. austeni for entomological monitoring in those =

AB: This paper examines some theoretical and practical aspects of deliverin=
g
  human and animal health care to rural societies. Economic theory of the p=
rivate
  versus the public good argues against the integration of human and animal
  health interventions. Judging by the scarcity of documented examples of
  beneficial integration of human and veterinary health care interventions,
  economic theory may indeed bear out what is found in practice. Explanatio=
ns for
  this apparent lack of integration of human and animal health care systems=
 may
  stem from the Western oriented, anthropocentric way development specialis=
ts
  approach the problem. Examples are described where appropriate and financ=
ially
  viable animal health delivery systems are designed on sound veterinary
  epidemiology and ethnoveterinary principles. These examples may serve as =
a
  basis for designing integrated human and veterinary health care intervent=
ions.
  Available tools, such as geographic information systems, sentinel cases, =
ethno
  -veterinary research and pictogram/computer systems, which may be used to
  design more cost effective interventions, are discussed.

  risk of infection with tuberculosis might be increasing in the general
  population. An investigation among US Navy recruits in 1990 provides some
  reassurance. Tuberculin Mantoux tests were carried out on some 2500 new
  recruits on whom demographic information was also obtained. The results w=
ere
  compared to studies done between 1958 and 1969 when more than a million s=
imilar
  recruits were tested. The findings were not startling: the prevalence of
  reactors had declined, particularly among the white US-born recruits, but=
 also
  among the non-white and foreign-born recruits, albeit more slowly. [While=
 this
  study is unable to provide reassurance that infection rates have not star=
ted to
  rise again since the mid-1980s, it provides some reassurance that the
  proportion of white US-born recruits that have been infected is very low.=
 Among
  non-whites and foreign-borns, a substantial proportion continue to enter
  adulthood with pre-existing tuberculosis infection providing an identifia=
ble
  target for prevention. The survey also provides a baseline for assessment=

he
  period 1986-90 (population covered increased from 220 000 to 470 000) wer=
e used
  to calculate weekly rates of aggregated respiratory disease for persons o=
f all
  ages and for elderly persons (aged 65 years and over). The elderly respir=
atory
  disease rates and numbers of deaths were aggregated into 4-week periods;
  secular and seasonal trends were removed from each series and the 2 sets =
of
  residuals were examined graphically and cross correlation coefficients
  calculated. There was a very strong positive association between the
  respiratory disease rate and number of deaths in the same 4-week period a=
nd
  there was also a significant but less pronounced association between
  respiratory disease in one 4-week period and deaths in the next. After pr=
ior
  separation of weeks according to temperature into 4 bands, weekly rates f=
or
  respiratory disease were also strongly associated with the number of week=
ly
  deaths for each temperature band. The synchronisation of peaks and trough=
s in
  the 2 series throughout the year supports the hypothesis that a cause and
  effect relationship exists between respiratory disease in the elderly and
  number of deaths. Other climatic and meterological variables besides
  temperature may play a part in determining the spread of a respiratory di=
sease.
  There is a need for further research to identify the micro-organisms
  responsible for acute respiratory infections in the elderly. AS=20

data
  for measles compiled from EPI sentinel surveillance data from 3 instituti=
ons in
  Kwara state for 1982-87 and from community surveys. Measles vaccination
  coverage rose from 26% in 1984 to 54-58% in 1986-88. The annual number of
  measles cases reported by the 3 sentinel institutions fell from over 4000=
 in

  years was 17.2%. The sexes were equally represented among the measles cas=

AB: Six hundred and ninety three IVDU (intravenous drug user) sera from
  Copenhagen, Malmo and Stockholm were tested, 247 retro- and 446 prospecti=
vely,
  for antibodies to human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV), types I and II, by m=
eans
  of a commercial whole-virus EIA and/or an HTLV-I/-II peptide-based EIA.
  Positive EIA reactions were checked and typed by electrophoretic
  immunoblotting, a differential peptide-based EIA and nucleic acid
  amplification/hybridization with HTLV-I and -II specific primers and prob=
es.
  Three (0.7%) of the prospectively tested IVDUs from Malmo, none of 100 fr=
om
  Stockholm and none of 45 from Copenhagen were HTLV-seropositive. The 3 Ma=
lmo
  IVDU cases were a female immigrant from South America, her male native Sw=
edish
  spouse (both HTLV-I), and a male immigrant Italian heroinist (HTLV-II). [=
The
  authors] conclude that HTLV was uncommon among intravenous drug users, a
  sentinel population, in Sweden and Denmark during 1986 and 1989. However,=
 the
  occurrence of 3 HTLV-positive cases in Malmo 1993 indicates that the situ=

  gradually decreasing antibody titres as detected in ELISA. Regardless of
  whether the initial titres were high or low, all reactants from the first

  reactions were not observed. A second administration of the vaccine to 3 =
sheep
  did not elicit more serious vaccination reactions. 43 sentinel sheep rema=

AB: The filtration effect of 3 types of mesh screen used for mosquito cages=
 was
  evaluated using aerosols of water, mineral oil or chlorpyrifos. The mater=
ials
  were 2 nylon tulles (3X4 and 8X11 repeats per cm2) and corrosion-resistan=
t
  steel (7X7 repeats per cm2). Open areas of these 3 mesh materials were,
  respectively, 94, 79 and 88%. The droplet size frequency distributions of=
 the
  aerosols were altered by their passage through test screens of these mate=
rials
  fitted to standard exposure tubes from WHO test-kits. The alterations inc=
luded
  reductions in total droplet numbers and volume median diameter (VmD). The=
 nylon
  screen with fewest repeats altered droplet VmD and frequency distribution=
 the
  least, allowing the greatest number of droplets to enter the cages. The
  greatest filtration effect was produced with screens with less open area,
  giving rise to selective deposition of particular droplet sizes on the sc=
reen
  material. This could result in anomalous exposures of test mosquitoes to
  insecticide filtrate on the screen substrate, which may explain the poor
  correlation often observed between insecticide aerosol impact on wild tar=
get
  mosquito populations as compared with sentinel caged mosquitoes. The need=
 for
  standardization of materials used for construction of sentinel cages empl=
oyed
  for aerosol bioassays is emphasized.

AB: A 1-year study of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in a small focus of
  transmission was conducted in suburban Bangkok in 1985. Monthly data were
  collected on weather, vector density, sentinel pig and chick JE antibody
  seroconversions, and epidemiology as related to human JE cases. The prima=
ry
  vector species were found to be Culex gelidus and C. tritaeniorhynchus, f=
rom
  which one isolate each was obtained in March and June, respectively. Pig =
JE
  antibody seroconversion peaked in April (the hottest month), with seconda=
ry
  peaks following in July and December. Chick seroconversions were found on=
ly in
  June and July. Human cases (7) in the primary focus occurred in May-July,=
 and
  started 2 months following the finding of the first JE virus isolate in
  mosquitoes and 1 month following mass virus seroconversion in pigs. Overa=
ll,
  the attack rate in the focus (0.83/105) was >4 times that of the rest of
  Bangkok (0.19/105). Attack rates were highest in 0- to 9- and 10- to 19-y=
ear
  -old groups, respectively. Indications are that JE virus is transmitted t=
o
  humans in Bangkok in at least 10 of 12 months per year, but that cases ar=
e
  concentrated in the May-July period.

AB: A serological survey and experimental virus transmission studies were d=
one
  to assess the role of domestic animals as amplifier hosts of La Crosse (L=
ACV)
  and Jamestown Canyon (JCV) viruses. Serum from 319 cows, 88 dogs, 122 equ=
ines,
  47 swine, 10 goats and 4 cats were tested for neutralizing antibody to LA=
CV,
  JCV, trivittatus (TVTV) and snowshoe hare (SSHV) viruses. Antibody preval=
ences
  of LACV, TVTV and SSHV were <10% in all species. Antibody to JCV was dete=
cted
  in all species except cats. Prevalence ranged from 10% in goats and swine=
 to
  29% in dogs. No age-associated trends in JCV prevalence were noted. Two o=
f 6
  adult dogs, and 2 of 4 pigs inoculated with 6.3-6.5 log10 suckling mouse
  intracerebral 50% lethal doses (SMICLD50) of LACV developed viraemias of =
<1.0
  -2.9 log10 SMICLD50/ml 1-3 days after inoculation. Of 4 cows inoculated w=
ith
  LACV, 3 developed fatal infections. Viraemias were not detected in 4 cows=
, 4
  ponies, 7 cats or 6 sheep. Two cats fed LACV infected suckling mice shed =
virus
  from the oropharynx for 1 day each. All animals except 1 cow, 1 cat and 1=
 sheep
  had _4-fold rise in antibody titres. Five additional dogs fed upon by LAC=
V
  -infected Aedes triseriatus mosquitoes did not develop viraemias or antib=
ody,
  and uninfected A. triseriatus engorging on the dogs 1-5 days after feedin=
g by
  infected mosquitoes failed to become infected. Five ponies, 6 calves, 2 e=
wes, 6
  dogs and 5 piglets were inoculated with 3.6-7.3 log10 SMICLD50 of JCV. No=
ne
  developed detectable viraemias, although _4-fold rises in antibody titres
  developed in 60% of the ponies, 17% of the calves, 50% of the dogs and 1 =
of 2
  ewes. None of the pigs developed corresponding rises in antibody titres. =
It was
  concluded that juvenile and adult animals of the species tested are not
  efficient amplifier hosts of LACV or JCV, but may be useful sentinels of =
local
  virus transmission.

AB: In northern California, antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi were detecte=
d in
  58 of 73 (79%), and spirochaetaemias in 1 of 26 (4%) black-tailed jackrab=
bits
  (Lepus californicus californicus), by indirect immunofluorescence,
  respectively. Five species of ticks (Dermacentor occidentalis, D. parumap=
ertus,
  Ixodes neotomae, I. pacificus and Haemaphysalis leporispalustris) were
  collected from rabbits. Two of these species of ticks were found to conta=
in
  spirochaetes; 2 of 10 (20%) of I. neotomae and 2 of 174 (1%) of H.
  leporispalustris. A strain of B. burgdorferi was recovered from I. neotom=
ae.
  One infected female of H. leporispalustris passed spirochaetes via eggs t=
o
  about 67% of her progeny. The widespread distribution of the jackrabbit, =
its
  infestation by at least 4 ticks (D. occidentalis, D. parumapertus, I. neo=
tomae
  and I pacificus) known to be infected naturally with B. burgdorferi, and =
the
  high prevalence of spirochaetal antibody in this lagomorph suggest that i=
t
  might be useful as a sentinel for surveillance of Lyme borreliosis.
  Spirochaetes were detected in 15% of 40 Columbian black-tailed deer (Odoc=
oileus
  hemionus columbianus) by direct immunofluorescence bound with a Borrelia
  -specific monoclonal antibody (H9724), but not with a monoclonal antibody
  (H5332) specific for B. burgdorferi. The geographical overlap of differen=
t
  borreliae in ticks that bite wildlife such as deer confound spirochaetal
  serosurveys, and underscores the need for more specific serologic tests t=
han
  those currently available.

AB: Bush rabbits (Sylvilagus bachmani) and black-tailed jackrabbits (Lepus
  californicus) from California were assayed for antibodies to Borrelia
  burgdorferi, the aetiologic agent of Lyme disease. Significant antibody t=
itres
  were detected in 90% (range, 67 to 100%) of brush rabbits from 4 of 6
  localities, and in 90% of jackrabbits from a single locality, in northern
  California. One of the populations of brush rabbits that did not yield
  seropositive individuals was from an oceanic island devoid of any other
  terrestrial mammal, whereas the other population was located on an isolat=
ed
  flood plain bordering San Francisco Bay. Absorption tests using B. burgdo=
rferi
  as antigen revealed that antibodies detected in both species of lagomorph=
s were
  directed against borreliae. These findings reinforced the earlier suggest=
ion
  that lagomorphs may be useful as sentinel animals for surveillance of
  borreliosis in the far western USA.

AB: Culex nigripalpus is a proven vector of St. Louis encephalitis virus (S=
LE)
  in southern Florida. It is an important vector for 3 reasons: its opportu=
nistic
  blood-feeding behaviour, its ability to forage and locate hosts in a vari=
ety of
  habitats, and its ability to retain eggs for long periods when suitable
  oviposition sites are unavailable. Results of laboratory and field observ=
ations
  documenting that C. nigripalpus fits the above criteria are presented. Fi=
eld
  data are also presented showing that SLE activity in sentinel birds (chic=
kens)
  as well as in humans occurs in Florida during years when heavy autumn rai=
nfalls
  are separated by periods of drought. Blood-feeding and oviposition behavi=
ours
  of C. nigripalpus are affected by rainfall. Large amounts of rainfall all=
ow
  mosquitoes to oviposit and then to enter and blood feed in habitats where=
 they
  could not previously forage because of the dry conditions. Thus, rainfall
  patterns are an important part of the SLE transmission cycle in southern
  Florida.

  uncertainty as to whether symptoms are more closely related to average st=

AB: In developing rural areas, the quality and availability of fresh water
  determine the endemicity of a substantial number of infectious diseases.
  However, few studies have examined the effect of new water sources on pat=
terns
  of water contact and the transmission of schistosomiasis.In the study rep=
orted
  here, a questionnaire survey was carried out on changes in the pattern of=
 water
  use in 2 groups of villages in the Coast Province of Kenya, one group hav=
ing
  access to piped water supplies while in the other group borehole wells ha=
d been
  introduced.Before the construction of the borehole wells significantly mo=
re use
  was made of water carrying a high risk of infection with Schistosoma
  haematobium in those villages without access to piped water compared with=
 those
  villages having access to piped water supplies. After construction of the
  boreholes, there was a significant decline in the use of high-risk water =
for
  drinking, cooking and dish-washing, but not for bathing and clothes-washi=
ng.
  Despite the provision of boreholes and a 3-year programme of chemotherapy=
,
  prevalence of S. haematobium infection was little affected in the village=
s with
  boreholes whereas in the villages that had access to piped supplies S.
  haematobium infections (which were already lower at the start of the stud=
y)
  declined further. Although there was little difference between the 2 area=
s in
  the numbers of snails or in the percentage infected, incidence and intens=
ity
  studies in sentinel groups of younger children from the 2 areas confirmed=
 the
  differences in human infection in the 2 groups of villages.The authors co=
nclude
  that although the introduction of boreholes can significantly alter some =
water
  usage, other factors, such as social issues and water quality [and probab=
ly
  quantity and availability], may limit the impact of communal wells on S.

les a
  seasonal peak has been observed in June, later than classically observed =
in the
  USA and Anglo-Saxon countries. The incidence rate rose from 375/105 in 19=
85 to
  a peak of 981/105 in 1987 (545 000 cases) before falling sharply to 239/1=
05 in
  1989; in comparison the rate in the USA in 1988 was 1.4/105. The average =
age of
  patients is 6 years, but with 42-49% of cases less than 5 years (i.e. of
  preschool age). In 1987 39 cases of encephalitis were identified. Each ye=
ar
  between 15 and 25 new cases of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis are
  recorded. There are still deaths of young infants in France due to measle=
s (10
  -30 a year in the period 1979-87), deaths that ought to be prevented thro=
ugh
  vaccination. The data from the sentinel GPs indicate an incidence of mump=
s of
  about 300/105 in 1988-about 150 000 cases-with average age of patients 9 =
years.
  Complications and sequelae were noted in about 3% of cases, with about 5-=
10
  deaths a year. The incidence of rubella is not clear except that about 10=
0
  cases of infection in pregnancy are recorded each year, with 10-40 cases =
of
  congenital rubella. There are fewer than 5 deaths a year. The number of
  abortions has varied considerably over the period 1976-87 but 67% are to
  multiparous women who ought to have been vaccinated after their first
  pregnancy. In 1987 a national survey evaluated coverage of 6-year-old chi=
ldren
  by measles-rubella vaccination; it was 41% for measles and 9.5% for rubel=
la
  with considerable variations between departements. In 1988 measles covera=
ge at
  24 months was 51.5% (18-82%), having risen steadily from 25% in 1983.A co=
st
  -benefit analysis in October 1988 indicated that of a vaccine coverage of=
 50%
  the cost to the country was for measles FFr250 million (about =A325 milli=
on), for
  mumps FFr148 million and rubella FFr157 million-costs including medical
  expenses and those due to loss of work (but not loss of production or the
  economic loss for young children). The cost of total vaccine coverage of
  infants <2 years old and vaccination of those aged 2-6 years who were not
  vaccinated was estimated to be FFr711 million, of which the vaccine itsel=
f
  accounted for FFr164 million. A net benefit would appear in the eighth ye=
ar.
  The vaccine strategy is set out: vaccination of all boys and girls from t=
he age
  of 12 months with pick up of those aged 2-6 years. For rubella girls aged=
 11-13
  years and seronegative women less than 45 years should be vaccinated.D.W.

AB: In 1981 the National Academy of Sciences, Washington DC, USA, through i=
ts
  Board on Science and Technology for International Development, set out to
  stimulate the development of improved epidemiological techniques for asse=
ssing
  health problems and evaluating health programmes in developing countries.=
 Rapid
  epidemiologic assessment (REA) was one of six research areas supported. T=
his
  special supplement draws together 9 research papers that all report on or
  review the use of REA methods.A major review of REA is provided in G.S. S=
mith's
  paper (pp. S2-S15). He outlines the evolution of REA from a series of ide=
as to
  a range of techniques, or as the author describes "to a defined area of
  epidemiologic research". He draws attention to 5 broad areas of work with=
in
  REA: (1) small area survey and sampling methods (including the Expanded
  Programme on Immunization cluster sample survey method widely advocated b=
y WHO;
  the use of lot quality assurance sampling; and the approach of rapid
  ethnographic asessment to provide anthropological data on personal and cu=
ltural
  factors affecting health behaviour); (2) surveillance methods (the approa=
ch of
  sentinel surveillance whereby a sample of health facilities collects
  surveillance data which are used as indicators of overall trends in the a=
rea;
  and improving the quality of mortality reporting); (3) screening and indi=
vidual
  risk assessment (for example, the use of simple arm circumference to asse=
ss
  malnutrition, an easier and more rapid measure than weight-for-height or =
-for
  -age; and the use of village health workers to perform health evaluations=
): (4)
  community indicators of risk or health status (for example, schoolchildre=
n's
  height and weight as an indicator of community malnutrition, or night bli=
ndness
  as a surrogate for vitamin A deficiency); and, (5) case-control methods i=
n
  evaluating a health programme (for example, the effectiveness of a water =
and
  sanitation programme in reducing diarrhoea in the Philippines, or evaluat=
ing
  vaccine efficiency).This article is valuable in providing an overview of =
REA
  and in the provision of numerous well referenced examples to illustrate i=
ts
  value and potential. REA is assisting in the provision of higher quality
  information. But, as Smith concludes, information even if obtained more r=
apidly
  is not enough. It must contribute to decision making, to generate more
  responsive policies towards Health for All. [Continued below.]

  51% positivity: 31% in those aged <9 years, rising to 64% in the 10-14-ye=
ars
  age-group, with no subsequent increase. Eleven of 16 sentinel dogs became
  seropositive (IFAT), and parasites were isolated from 10. The mean
  seroconversion time was 4.4 months. Local seronegative dogs became infect=
ed at
  a somewhat lower rate. Twelve isolates (8 identified as Leishmania chagas=
i)
  were obtained from 37 opossums (Didelphis marsupialis). Lutzomyia longipa=
lpis
  was by far the most common sandfly; 6 of 681 had flagellates in their gut=
s, and
  4 of these infections were confirmed to be L. chagasi.[This careful study
  provokes many questions. Why are there not more human cases? Why is there=
 no
  continuing increase with age in skin-test positivity in adults? How impor=

AB: Spiroplasmas which were isolated from mosquitoes in France belonged to =
at
  least 3 serogroups and were serologically different from isolate Sp2 from
  Taiwan. The French Ar 1343 strain was the prototype of a new serogroup (X=
III).
  During 1983-85, the ecology of mosquito spiroplasmas was studied in diffe=
rent
  biotopes in the Isere River valley region of Savoia, France. Twenty-three
  strains were isolated from 4 species or groups of species of mosquitoes: =
Aedes
  sticticus/A. vexans, A. cantans/A. annulipes, A. cinereus/A. geminus and
  Coquillettidia richiardii. The spiroplasmas were isolated only from femal=
e
  mosquitoes and only in June and July. An unidentified virus was also isol=
ated
  from 3 mosquito pools, one of which yielded spiroplasmas. No spiroplasma
  viruses were detected. Antibody to the Ar 1357 isolate (serogroup XXII) w=
as
  found in 4 of 20 serum samples from cows living in the study area, but no=
t in
  sera of wild rodents or of sentinel rabbits and pigeons. Preliminary resu=
lts on
  the experimental infection of A. aegypti with Ar 1357 are given.

AB: A survey of 20 households was conducted at Amama, Santiago del Estero
  Province, Argentina, an area where there was active transmission of Trypa=

  cruzi. Spraying of walls and roofs with Neopynamin [tetramethrin] reveale=
d
  relatively few individuals of Triatoma infestans (<50 per house) in about=
 a
  quarter of the dwellings, and relatively high densities (>50 bugs) in all=
 but
  one of the rest. Less than 16 bugs were infected with Trypanosoma cruzi i=
n 6
  homes, while most of the rest yielded at least 40. Statistically signific=
ant
  differences were found between the infection rates of both children and d=
ogs in
  'low-risk' and 'high-risk' settings. Captures of <15 infected bugs per
  household are suggested to be below threshold densities for successful
  transmission of T. cruzi to children. The findings also suggested that
  relatively cheaper control measures than those currently employed might
  interrupt parasite transmission, that dogs were more likely than children
  inhabiting the same house to acquire the infection, that the presence of
  infected dogs may increase the risk of transmission to human residents, a=
nd
  that the status of infection in dogs could provide a means of assessing t=
he
  likelihood of infection in children.

AB: A pig found infected with T. spiralis at slaughter was traced to its fa=
rm of
  origin in the USA, where an epidemiological investigation found the infec=
tion
  prevalent in swine and rats. Garbage-feeding was not responsible for
  maintaining the high prevalence of infection, although it may have been
  responsible historically for the introduction of the infection. Poor husb=
andry,
  malnutrition, and intercurrent disease resulted in frequent death and the
  availability of porcine carcasses for cannibalism. Tissue samples from pa=
rtly
  devoured carcasses contained T. spiralis larvae, implicating cannibalism =
as a
  major vehicle for the spread of T. spiralis in the herd. Rats also fed on=
 these
  carcasses, and their rate of infection increased markedly during the firs=
t 5
  months of observation. Experimental investigation indicated that rats cou=
ld
  also be important in maintaining a high prevalence of infection in swine.=
 For
  the purpose of the investigation, the farm was depopulated of swine and
  restocked with parasite-free, sentinel pigs confined in 3 groups exposed =
to
  increasing degrees of contact with rats. Pigs exposed to large numbers of=
 rats
  acquired infections rapidly, whereas pigs with strongly limited rat expos=
ure
  failed to acquire infection during a 12-month period.

AB: An ecological study was conducted during 1983-84 to evaluate the role o=
f
  some haematophagous arthropods as possible vectors and/or reservoirs of
  Jamestown Canyon (JC) virus on the Delaware-Maryland-Virginia Peninsula.
  Arthropods were collected and assayed for virus in Vero cells by standard
  plaque technique. Sera from sentinel goats, free-ranging goats and wild
  vertebrates were assayed for JC-virus-neutralizing (N) antibody by plaque
  -reduction neutralization tests. This virus was not isolated from 158 253=
 adult
  bloodsucking insects, including 139 392 Aedes mosquitoes (e.g. A. canaden=
sis,
  A. cantator, A. sollicitans and A. taeniorhynchus) and 3572 other biting =
flies
  (Chrysops, Hybomitra, Tabanus and other Tabanidae and Stomoxys calcitrans=
), nor
  from 44 785 Aedes mosquitoes reared from larvae and 3328 ticks (Amblyomma
  americanum and Dermacentor variabilis) collected as nymphs or adults. How=
ever,
  2 isolates of Cache Valley virus were obtained from Aedes taeniorhynchus =
and A.
  sollicitans. Serological evidence indicated that JC virus was transmitted=
 to
  domestic goats during May 1983 and June 1984. Also, antibody was demonstr=
ated
  in sera obtained from Sylvilagus floridanus (4/13), Didelphis virginiana
  (4/25), Procyon lotor (11/141), and Odocoileus virginianus (34/47). The a=
bsence
  of JC virus in Aedes mosquitoes in the presence of virus transmission to
  mammals strongly implies that this virus was maintained and transmitted i=
n this
  area by arthropods other than Aedes mosquitoes.

AB: C. bushiensis has been associated with late-summer duck mortality in
  southern Quebec, Canada. In an attempt to relate these die-offs with seas=
onal
  availability of the infective metacercariae to the ducks, 2 intermediate =
host
  (Bithynia tentaculata L.) populations were regularly sampled in 1984 and =
1985.
  Prevalence varied between 5.3 and 57.3% at the South River, and between 9=
.1 and
  49.7% at Lake St. Francis over the period of the study. Maximum abundance=
s at
  the 2 localities were 1.38 and 1.66 metacercariae/snail, respectively. No=
 close
  link between availability of metacercariae and periods of duck mortality =
was
  found, as the total prevalence and abundance of the cysts decreased throu=
gh the
  summer, probably as a consequence of snail recruitment and low cercarial
  transmission rates, and increased in the autumn. Prevalence and abundance=
 of
  metacercariae increased with snail age, estimated by both size and annual
  growth lines, and the metacercariae were found to be aggregated in the sn=
ail
  population. Comparison of infection levels reached at the end of the 2 sa=
mpling
  seasons by 2 year classes of B. tentaculata suggested that transmission o=
f
  cercariae was higher in 1984 than in 1985. This was supported by the resu=
lts of
  exposure of sentinel snails in an infected area during the 2 years of the
  study: transmission was detected in 1984 but not in 1985. In addition to =
C.
  bushiensis metacercariae, the sentinel snails acquired Spaeridiotrema glo=
bulus,
  another potential duck pathogen, in both years. The peak rate of transmis=
sion
  of S. globulus metacercariae occurred in August.

  fly breeding habitats. Under a raised feedbunk, parasitism ranged from 32=

  63.5% when monitored by a linear arrangement of sentinel pupae of M. dome=
stica.
  Dispersal patterns were not apparent; average parasitoid emergence from
  sentinel pupae on each side of the release point were not significantly
  different. Parasitoid releases in open-piled manure generally produced lo=

  parasitism levels than under the feedbunk. In open-piled manure, Muscidif=

  the levels of parasitism achieved in either habitat. Increasing the densi=

AB: The natural transmission of H. meleagridis was studied over a 2-year pe=
riod
  in Florida with domestic sentinel turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo). Transmis=
sion
  began in mid-April in northern Florida with the onset of warmer weather a=
nd
  continued with occasional interruptions until the beginning of cooler win=
ter
  weather in January; transmission in the warmer subtropical climate of sou=
thern
  Florida continued at high levels throughout the year. Exposures in southe=
rn
  Florida as short as 24 h were sufficient to infect 100% of sentinel birds=
.
  Biting and light-trap collections of Culicoides capable of complete sporo=
gonic
  development of the parasite were made during each sentinel exposure. C. e=
deni
  was active throughout periods of natural transmission of H. meleagridis,
  whereas C. hinmani, C. arboricola and C. knowltoni were absent or inactiv=
e
  during cooler winter months when significant transmission occurred. The
  epizootiology of H. meleagridis in southern Florida is similar to stable
  holoendemic human malaria, where transmission may occur at high levels
  throughout the year. By contrast, transmission in the more temperate clim=
ate of
  northern Florida more closely resembled unstable hyperendemic malaria, wh=
ere
  variations in environmental conditions, host density and vector abundance=
 may
  cause wide fluctuations in the incidence of infection.

AB: A study was made in a small village in Kwale, Kenya, between June 1982 =
and
  May 1986, of seasonal density fluctuations in populations of Bulinus glob=
osus,
  prevalence of Schistosoma haematobium infection in the snail, and of the
  effects of chemotherapy and piped water-supply on infection rates in
  snails.Relatively few snails were collected in the perennially-flowing Pe=
mba
  River, and only during the hot dry season (December to March). In the Kad=
ingo
  River, however, a tributary stream, whose flow ceased at the end of both =
the
  cool and hot dry seasons, snail numbers were highest at the end of the co=
ol dry
  season (October to November), and at the beginning of the hot dry season
  (January). Large numbers of infected snails were found in the Kadingo Riv=
er
  from November to January, during the short rainy season and beginning of =
the
  dry season. Fewer infected snails were found in the Pemba River and it is
  thought that the infection rate of snails is affected by stream velocity =
and
  water volume. When sentinel snails were exposed to miracidia in a natural
  situation, no infections were found when water velocity exceeded 13
  cm/sec.Selective population chemotherapy with metriphonate and provision =
of
  piped water commenced in February and March 1984, and a significant reduc=
tion
  in the infection rate of snails (P <0.001) was achieved. The annual infec=
tion
  rate for the 2 years before treatment was 9.3% and 13.1% in the 2 habitat=
s
  combined, and for the 2 years after treatment 3.5% and 3.4%, respectively=
. A
  follow-up study showed that 1 year later the overall infection rate in B.
  globosus had fallen to 30% of the previous level and 2 years later the ra=
te
  remained low. The intensity of infection in the community was reduced fro=
m a
  geometric mean of 46.5 eggs/h to 9.4 eggs/h by treatment (80% reduction) =
in all
  age-groups, and it was 11.6 eggs/h at the examination carried out 28 mont=
hs
  after treatment. The community water-supply system not only reduced human=
 water
  contact with cercarial-infested water but also reduced the number of
  uncooperative villagers who refused examination and treatment. It is clea=
r,
  however, that transmission persisted at a low level after chemotherapy an=
d
  provision of water supplies, and that because of immigration, additional
  control efforts will be required.[The results of this study are comparabl=
e with
  those obtained in other projects, and underline the value of selective
  population chemotherapy together with provision of appropriate water supp=
lies
  for control of schistosomiasis. The value of relatively cheap metriphonat=
e is
  also highlighted for treatment of S. haematobium infection.]G. Webbe=20

  overall incidence and transmission patterns of hepatitis B remained relat=

  Homosexual activity was quoted in only 9% of cases in 1986-87. This drop =
of 57%

rt
  (ibid., (14), 223-26). Its main points are summarized in this article. Wi=
th
  regard to reported AIDS cases the US Public Health Service has revised it=
s
  projected total number by the end of 1992 upwards to 365 000. Broadening =
of the
  case definition in September 1987 lead to an increase in the proportion o=
f
  reported cases in blacks from 24 to 36%, in Hispanics from 13 to 16% and =
in
  heterosexuals from 2.6 to 3.6% over the subsequent 12 months. Experts agr=
ee
  that 1.0-1.5 million people presently infected with HIV is a "reasonable
  working estimate"; when this figure was first quoted in 1986 it was proba=
bly an
  overestimate. Seroprevalence surveys among hospital patients and Job Corp=
s
  entrants show that 0.4% are infected with HIV. In prisoners, too, that is=
 the
  mean seroprevalence although rates range from 0 to 15%. Infection rates i=
n
  sentinel populations have not increased with time over 15-33 months of
  observation; this is held to be consistent with some continued transmissi=
on of
  HIV but not an explosive spread. Three large surveys are in progress: a
  comprehensive family of more than 420 different surveys of HIV infection,=
 a
  national household seroprevalence survey, and a national health interview
  survey.D.W. FitzSimons=20

AB: It is thought that cases of whooping cough in Amsterdam have been
  underestimated in 1985-86, with under-reporting in 1985 estimated (95%
  confidence interval) to be about 60% (range 44-70%) and in 1986 52% (23-6=
9%).
  The incidences of the disease in these 2 years were estimated to be 73 an=
d 39
  per 100 000 inhabitants respectively (note that this covers all age group=
s).
  Based on notified cases from sentinel general practitioners in the city, =
the
  incidences in 1985 and 1986 were respectively 56 and 27 per 100 000 for a=
ll age
  groups. This contrasted with figures of notified cases for the whole of t=
he
  city in these years (23 and 13 respectively per 100 000). The figures pro=
vided
  by the sentinel GPs were considered to be the more accurate. Typical figu=
res
  (per 100 000 of the particular age group) for 1985 as provided by these l=
atter
  were: _1 year, 610; 1-4 years, 234; 5-9 years, 382; 10-19 years, 69; 20-4=
4
  years, 34; _45 years, 4.[There must be some question about the reliabilit=
y of
  either the sentinel GP data or the notifications. The latter may be lower
  because of stricter diagnostic criteria or because of lesser motivation t=
o
  report genuine cases when diagnosed. The sentinel GPs, conversely, may ha=
ve
  used their greater enthusiasm to diagnose atypical cases falsely. How wer=
e the
  diagnoses made by either group? ]William Houston and N.W. Preston=20

in the
  central part of the metropolitan area, which was consistent with other
  epidemiologic data. The use of specific avian species (e.g. house finches
  (Carpodacus mexicanus), house sparrows (Passer domesticus), mourning dove

  described. This assay was developed for the rapid detection of serum anti=
bodies
  to eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) virus and St. Louis encephaliti=
s
  (SLE) virus in sentinel chickens. Antigens were spot-filtered through the
  membrane. Membranes were dipped into small vials of sera. Antigen-antibod=
y
  complexes were detected with enzyme-conjugated antiglobulin which, when e=
xposed
  to substrate, produced a coloured insoluble product. The antibody detecti=
on
  protocol was completed within 50 min and was compared with a standard pla=
te
  enzyme immunoassay. Chickens were experimentally infected with EEE and SL=
E and
  bled on a daily basis. The dot immunoassay correctly identified 99% (123/=
124)
  of the EEE virus and 100% (67/67) of the SLE virus antisera. Sera from se=
ntinel
  chicken flocks in Maryland were also assayed. These data indicated that t=
he dot
  immunoassay should be considered as an alternative to current assays for =
the
  screening of sera for antibodies to virus antigens. This assay could easi=
ly be
  performed in the field and allows for the screening of antibodies to seve=
ral
  different viruses in one test.

cate
  the accurate estimation of parasitism by field sampling are discussed, na=
mely:
  the removal of acceptable hosts while still subject to attack; fluctuatio=
ns in
  host and parasite populations at the time of sampling; the availability o=

  hosts within different habitats; differential susceptibility of hosts; mu=
ltiple
  parasite attack; variations in the duration of susceptible host stages an=
d
  parasite development; and host mortality when no parasite progeny are pro=
duced,
  i.e. dudding. The use of sentinel host populations permit the management =
of
  several of the biases introduced by these factors.

  of 68% was reached for the hybridization assay, with most false-negative
  results in the low-parasitaemia samples. Freeze-stored blood samples gave=
 a
  sensitivity of 85% and in another trial 100% was reached. The practical u=
se of
  the DNA probe in epidemiological studies was emphasized [but a lot has to=
 be
  done to make this technique preferrable to the thick-smear reading. The
  complicated nature of the whole procedure requires well-trained personnel=
 and a
  central laboratory. The amount of blood required lengthens the collecting=
 time:
  although 50 samples were claimed to be collected per day, only 260 suitab=
le
  samples were obtained in 10 days. Another drawback for epidemiological st=
udies
  is that the quantitation of autoradiographs is not ideal, as compared wit=
h
  thick smears. A relationship between clinical signs and parasitaemia has =
still
  to be based on the examination of parasites; the same holds when informat=
ion of
  gametocytaemia is needed. Quantitative aspects are within reach only with=
 a P.
  falciparum probe, because probes based on other species would detect DNA =
not
  only in ring forms but also in schizonts. The best application would be
  qualitatively in situations where P. falciparum epidemics are to be expec=
ted.
  As a sentinel test it would prevent the microscope reading of innumerable
  negative slides and the problems of back-log and loss of care.]J.P. Verha=

cases
  in February, March, April and September and 3 and 2 cases in October and

the
  centre of Bangkok where 7 of these cases occurred. The primary vector spe=
cies
  were Culex gelidus and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus from which single virus isol=
ates
  were obtained in March and June respectively. Sentinel-pig seroconversion
  peaked in April with secondary peaks in July and December. Human cases we=

  mosquitoes and 1 month after mass seroconversion in pigs, with attack rat=

  ephemeral fever on a dairy farm in eastern Australia in the summer of 198=
1-82.
  Of the 22 cattle, 9 developed clinical ephemeral fever. None developed su=
b
  -clinical infection. The pattern of the epidemic was single index case fo=
llowed
  10 days later by the main epidemic wave which lasted for 7 days. This wav=
e
  stopped when there were still 14 uninfected susceptible animals remaining=
 in
  the sentinel group, and when biting flies were very active. Ten isolation=
s of
  bovine ephemeral fever virus were made in Aedes albopictus tissue culture=
s from
  the blood of 5 clinical cases. 112 isolations of CSIRO Village virus and =
one
  each of Kimberley and Akabane viruses were also made from various members=
 of
  the sentinel group. There was serological evidence that infections with
  Tibrogargan, Tinaroo and Aino viruses also occurred in 6 cattle in the
  observation period. The 13 cattle undergoing a sub-clinical viraemia with=
 CSIRO
  Village virus, Tibrogargan, Kimberley, Akabane or Aino viruses at the tim=
e of
  the main outbreak, appeared to be temporarily protected against ephemeral
  fever. However, 9 of the 11 still remaining in the herd were susceptible =
in a
  subsequent outbreak of ephemeral fever 2 years later. Evidence is present=
ed
  that subclinical infections with other arboviruses may limit an ephemeral=
 fever
  epidemic by providing temporary protection by interference.

AB: The seasonal and diel activity patterns of pteromalids parasitic on the
  pupae of Musca domestica in poultry manure were studied in California usi=
ng the
  sentinel-bag technique. Individuals of Muscidifurax zaraptor were mostly
  recovered in July-October, of M. raptor in June-October and of Spalangia
  cameroni in May-November. Other parasites occasionally recovered were S.
  nigroaenea in July, September and November, S. endius in July and Nasonia
  vitripennis in March and July. The exposure of pupae in a 12-h diurnal or=
 a 12
  -h nocturnal period indicated that females of M. zaraptor and probably th=
ose of
  S. cameroni were primarily diurnal in their searching activity, though so=
me
  nocturnal activity was noted in the latter species. Predation by the form=
icid
  Solenopsis maniosa [S. xyloni] caused heavy losses of pupae in the surfac=
e
  manure in the summer. The use of dimethoate against muscid larvae appeare=
d to
  have a deleterious effect on parasites.

AB: A discrete population of Anopheles balabacensis was studied in a fringe=
 area
  of a mixed secondary tropical forest in western Sabah, Malaysia. Blood-fe=
d
  females were collected daily in outdoor bare-leg catches in sentinel stat=
ions,
  marked with fluorescent powders, released and recaptured. By varying the =
colour
  used for marking, estimates were made of the distance of dispersal from t=
he
  release point to other stations, the daily survival rate and the proporti=
on of
  the wild populations caught in sentinel stations each day. The best estim=
ates
  of daily survival were 0.719 and 0.7874, but these figures did not match =
well
  with an independently derived result from parity dissections. This was th=
ought
  to be the first time that an independent check had been used to determine=
 the
  accuracy of mark-release-recapture methods for determining survival rates=
 of
  this species. The recovery rate of marked mosquitoes averaged 16.1%. Disp=
ersal
  studies showed that movement within the forest fringe was almost random u=
p to
  112 m from the release point. Estimated population sizes declined from 11=
 000
  to 5500 during the experiment. The results suggested that the majority of
  individuals of A. balabacensis from any one brood probably survived for a=
s long
  as 13 days after emergence during the normal inter-monsoon weather condit=
ions
  in the western part of Sabah.

AB: Investigations on the ecology of Ockelbo disease, presumed to be caused=
 by
  Sindbis virus, were carried out near Esdbyn, Sweden, in 1983. A total of =
266
  pools of 11 154 female and 2179 male mosquitoes, collected in March-Octob=
er
  with animal-baited traps, light traps and from man, cattle sheds and
  overwintering sites was processed for virus isolation attempts. Sindbis v=
irus
  was isolated from 2 pools of unengorged females. One of the pools consist=
ed of
  50 females of Culex pipiens and the other from 24 of Culiseta morsitans,
  collected between 20 July and 3 August. Sera from sentinel bait animals w=
ere
  drawn at 2-week intervals in May-September, and Sindbis virus neutralizin=
g
  antibodies were found in a pigeon in August. These results strengthen the
  hypothesis that Sindbis virus circulates in a sylvatic cycle involving
  ornithophagous culicines and birds. Inkoo virus (California serogroup),
  previously known only from Finland, was isolated from 1 pool of 100 uneng=
orged
  females of Aedes communis collected between 21 June and 5 July. The high
  prevalence of Inkoo virus neutralizing antibodies detected in human sera
  indicates that this virus is widely distributed in Sweden.

  within a 7.2-km radius of a turkey farm were treated with a wettable powd=

  formulation of Bacillus thuringiensis. Erratic and high levels of precipi=
tation
  during 1981 prevented adequate treatment of the streams. A more frequent
  treatment schedule was maintained in 1982, resulting in substantial decre=
ases
  in the blood parasitaemia levels of L. smithi in sentinel and commercial =
flocks
  of turkeys, and no losses or observable pathology in these birds. In 1982=
, as
  in previous years, infection levels were higher in ranged turkeys that in
  housed birds. During 1982, L. smithi gametocyte levels were much higher i=
n
  housed turkeys than those observed in previous years. This reflected the
  greater numbers of Simulium vectors entering the houses to feed; however,=
 the
  reasons for this are unclear.

AB: In the Bakersfield area of Kern County, California, populations of Cule=
x
  tarsalis resistant to all available organophosphorus insecticides cause a=
nnual
  epizootics of western equine encephalitis and present a constant risk of
  infection to the largely non-immune human population nearby. The progress=
 of
  resistance of this culicid to Baygon [propoxur], malathion and chlorpyrif=
os was
  investigated in laboratory and field studies in 1983 on adults from vario=
us
  localities in Kern County. Susceptibility to malathion and chlorpyrifos w=
as too
  variable from place to place to permit the effective use of these compund=
s for
  the emergency suppression of C. tarsalis during an epidemic. In the case =
of
  propoxur, mortality was comparatively consistent, regardless of the geogr=
aphic
  origin of the test mosquitoes. However, successive decline in average mos=
quito
  mortality in sentinel cages placed in transects exposed to propoxur spray=
s from
  aircraft, in cages outside the spray zone where traps baited with carbon
  dioxide were present, and in cages sheltered by vegetation, was attribute=
d to
  the amount of plant canopy protecting each group; this indicated that the
  target populations were susceptible to propoxur when directly exposed to =
spray
  particles.

AB: The postparasitic stage of the mermithid Romanomermis culicivorax and t=
he
  asexual stage of the fungus Lagenidium giganteum were studied in rice fie=
lds in
  California, and the oospores of this fungus in the laboratory. The result=
s of
  the field tests were monitored with sentinel cages containing larvae of C=
ulex
  pipiens (for R. culicivorax) and of Anopheles freeborni or C. tarsalis (f=
or L.
  giganteum). The nematodes overwintered successfully along 8 different lin=
es of
  inoculation in 4 rice fields. Infection rates were 0-32%, without obvious
  correlation with differing application rates (25, 50 or 150 g postparasit=
es/100
  m) or methods. Infection rates of 21-86% were found in mosquito larvae ca=
ged
  along inoculation transects, and low infection levels at up to 10 m from
  release points. In field tests with L. giganteum, the asexual stage at al=
l
  rates successfully infected A. freeborni and C. tarsalis. In the laborato=
ry the
  oospores, activated by successive dehydration and rehydration, germinated=
 over
  a period of several months. At the lowest oospore dosage tested (3 X
  104/litre), an infection peak occurred after 7 days and gave 50% infectio=
n for
  20 days, and at dosages of 1.5 or 3 X 105/litre, infection rates of at le=
ast
  80% remained for about 30 days, with some activity persisting for a furth=
er 21
  days.

AB: In preliminary field studies at 27 sites in Sutter and Yuba Counties of
  California on the biological control of culicid larvae by means of Romano=
mermis
  culicivorax, preparasites of this mermithid were placed at 1000/m2 where
  mosquito larvae were present at densities greater than 1 larva/dip, and
  postparasites at 0.4 g/m in sites where the mosquito density was lower.
  Sentinel cages containing laboratory-reared larvae of Culex pipiens were =
placed
  for 48 h in release sites where no wild larvae could be recovered after
  treatment. Of the 22 sites sampled for infested mosquito larvae, 13 prove=
d
  positive, with infestation rates of 27.85=B19.09%. Infestation tended to =
decline
  between June and September, but no relationship was found between infesta=
tion
  and soil or water temperatures, soil types or degree of shading by tree
  canopies. Heavy mortality of sentinel larvae (infected or not by R.
  culicivorax) could not be definitely explained, and multiple parasitism o=
r
  water quality are suggested as possible reasons. The application rate of =
0.4 g
  postparasites/m in this study was observed to be much more effective than=
 the
  rate of 0.1 g previously used.

AB: In large water areas schistosomiasis transmission is mainly limited to =

  water contact sites. Mollusciciding is expensive but may still be an effe=
ctive
  control measure if limited to these sites. This paper reports on the foca=
l
  application of 70% Bayluscide wettable powder to irrigation canals and na=
tural
  lakes in Mali and attempts made to evaluate its effectiveness.Water conta=
ct
  areas were searched for snails before and after treatment with 2-3 p.p.m.
  Bayluscide applied to marginal vegetation 10-40 m above and 10 m downstre=
am of
  the site. Where snails were found among low submerged vegetation the chem=
ical
  was applied directly on to the plants using a long nozzle. Sentinel snail=
s were
  placed in cages at key points to assist in the evaluation of the control.=
 The
  results show a high killing rate of the snails and a minimal effect on th=
e fish
  population. It is concluded that a focal use of molluscicides at 4-6 week=
ly
  intervals is a satisfactory method of snail control but that the necessar=
y
  snail searches and careful application are time consuming.[Interesting, b=
ut the
  results are no different from those found 20-25 years ago. The key test w=
ill be
  to see what effect mollusciciding has on prevalence and intensity of huma=

  Jamestown Canyon (JC) virus on the Delaware-Maryland-Virginia Peninsula, =
USA.
  Arthropods were collected and assayed for virus in Vero cells by standard
  plaque technique. Sera from sentinel goats, free-ranging goats, and wild
  vertebrates were assayed for JC-virus-neutralizing (N) antibody by plaque
  -reduction neutralization tests. This virus was not isolated from 158 253=
 adult
  bloodsucking insects, including 139 392 Aedes mosquitoes and 3572 other b=
iting
  flies, nor from 44 785 Aedes mosquitoes reared from larvae and 3328 ticks
  collected as nymphs or adults. However, 2 isolates of Cache Valley virus =
were
  obtained from Aedes mosquitoes. Serological evidence indicated that JC vi=
rus
  was transmitted to domestic goats during May 1983 and June 1984. Also, an=
tibody
  was demonstrated in sera obtained from the Eastern Cottontail (4/13), Vir=
ginia
  Opossum (4/25), Raccoon (11/141), and White-tailed Deer (34/47). The abse=
nce of
  JC virus in Aedes mosquitoes in the presence of virus transmission to mam=

s
  complex from 2 areas of the Delmarva Peninsula (Maryland and Virginia, US=
A).
  The eggs were hatched and the resulting 22 370 adult mosquitoes were assa=
yed in
  969 pools for the presence of La Crosse (LAC) virus: no virus was obtaine=
d. No
  virus was isolated from mosquitoes of the Ae. triseriatus complex collect=

  from goat-baited traps. In addition, only 1 of 143 samples of serum from
  racoons in 1983 and 1984 was positive for neutralizing antibody to LAC vi=
rus
  and none from 36 sentinel domestic goats and 99 other wild mammals. One
  possible explanation for the apparent absence of LAC virus from the penin=

is
  uncommon there.Carolyn A. Brown=20

LA: English
AB: The asexual stages of Lagenidium giganteum are easy to grow in fermento=
rs
  but difficult to handle and store. Oospores can be produced in fermentor
  cultures, with yields of 5 X 107/l, and they can be stored after drying, =
which
  activates them, but germination on rehydration is low (<20%) and asynchro=
nous.
  Fermentor-grown, 5-day-old cultures and dried oospores of the California =
(ATCC
  52675) strain of L. giganteum were applied to test plots in California ri=
ce
  fields, from the ground by backpack sprayer, and from aircraft by seed ho=
ppers
  using corn cobs as a carrier. Evaluation was by dipper sampling the natur=
al
  infestations of mosquito larvae (Anopheles freeborni, Culex tarsalis) and=
 by
  exposing sentinel larvae (laboratory-reared Cx. tarsalis) in cages in the=
 plots
  for 3-4 days.Encouraging results were obtained in a plot treated from the
  ground with culture medium and dried oospores. Infection rates in sentine=
l
  larvae were over 90% for the first 10 days then fell to zero by day 14, b=
ut
  after the field was dry from about day 15 to day 23 they rose again and
  remained between 80% and 100% until day 90. In plots treated with oospore=
s
  alone from the ground or from the air, and also in plots treated with cul=
ture
  medium alone from the ground, infection rates in sentinel larvae varied
  unpredictably between 0 and 100%, up to day 85. In a plot treated by airc=
raft
  with culture medium, 99% of the first (day 4) and 38% of the last (day 18=
)
  sentinel larvae were infected, and natural infestation levels were reduce=
d

AB: In the District of Burdwan, a rural area of West Bengal State, India,
  Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus is endemic. In 1 village a longitudinal =
survey
  was conducted in order to find out whether associations could be establis=
hed
  between the density of the vector mosquito Culex vishnui in 2 types of re=
sting
  places, the incidence of infections in sentinel chicks exposed at monthly
  intervals, the prevalence of antibodies in wild birds and the occurrence =
of
  clinical infections in the human population. The experiment lasted from A=
ugust
  1981 till August 1982. Meteorologically a summer season (March-June), a r=
ainy
  season (July-October) and a winter season (November-February) are
  distinguished. In the sentinel chicks infections were observed in all 3
  seasons; in wild birds antibodies were prevalent throughout the year; the=
se
  observations suggest perennial transmission of the virus in its maintenan=
ce
  cycle. Human infections were observed periodically with, in August 1982, =
a
  pronounced peak; this may point to fluctuations in the level of circulati=
on of
  the virus in its maintenance cycle and spillover to the human population =
at
  times of peak circulation. The peaks may be related to the influx of youn=
g non
  -immune birds and newborn mammals into the animal population in summer. F=
urther
  studies, including virus isolation attempts from mosquitoes and nestling =
birds,
  are required to prove this hypothesis.AS/B.R. Laurence=20

  hamsters exposed in tropical wet forest in the Rio de Oro Region of Colom=
bia in
  1983, thirteen years after the 1st strain was isolated from the region.
  Hydroxyapatite elution profiles of 3 isolates from the region were typica=
l of
  enzootic strains. Females of Culex pedroi and C. spissipes were taken
  frequently in the area using light traps and human bait. Relative abundan=
ce
  data and previous isolations suggested that C. pedroi was the probable en=
zootic
  vector at the focus, whereas Psorophora ferox, a day-biting species, and =
C.
  spissipes were considered to be potential vectors. The virus was not isol=
ated
  from forests near Santa Marta and Magangue, 9 and 16 years, respectively,=
 after
  the last isolations in those areas. However, the sera of equine animals 2=
-10
  years of age and humans 25-67 years of age living near the Magangue field=
 study
  area were positive for VEE virus-specific neutralizing antibodies. The
  mosquitoes collected in the Santa Marta Region included P. ferox, C. pedr=

  spissipes, C. crybda, C. adamesi, C. idottus, Aedes fulvus fulvus, A.

AB: Young chickens were inoculated with 5000 PFU of eastern equine encephal=
itis
  (EEE) virus and bled at intervals thereafter for determinations of
  hemagglutination-inhibiting (HI), neutralizing (N), immunoglobulin M (IgM=
), and
  IgG antibodies. HI, N, and IgM antibodies were first detected 4 days afte=
r
  infection, and IgG was detected 7 days after infection. All four antibodi=
es
  persisted through day 90 after infection. HI, N, and IgM antibody titers
  remained elevated and were not cross-reactive with the related alphavirus
  western equine encephalitis (WEE) virus. IgG antibody titers also remaine=
d
  high, but heterologous reactivity to WEE virus increased with time after
  infection. Serum samples from sentinel chickens and wild birds infected i=
n
  nature with EEE, WEE, or St Louis encephalitis virus ... were tested for =
IgM
  antibody by using anti-chicken IgM for capture and for IgG antibodies to =
the
  EEE and WEE viruses. There was essentially complete correlation between H=
I, N,
  and either IgM (indicating recent infections) or IgG (indicating more rem=
ote
  infections) antibody. [The authors] conclude that the IgM antibody captur=
e
  enzyme immunoassay can be used as a specific and sensitive assay to repla=
ce the
  routinely used HI test for detecting antibody in sentinel chickens and in
  young, wild birds used for arbovirus surveillance. The test is rapid and
  relatively inexpensive and can be performed in essentially all adequately

  -mercaptoethanol-sensitive haemagglutination-inhibiting (HAI) antibody
  activity. Within 2-3 days, JEV-infected sentinel pigs developed high JEV =
IgM
  activity; this activity decreased within 2 weeks. Among specimens collect=

  transmission, none of 25 JEV HAI-negative sera had JEV IgM activity, 7 of=
 74
  JEV HAI-positive sera had JEV IgM activity, and the remaining 67 sera had

AB: Serological surveys of wild and domestic birds, wild mammals and horses=
 were
  conducted during arbovirus field studies in Argentina in 1977-80, a non
  -epizootic interval. The presence of antibodies in short-lived bird speci=
es and
  in young unvaccinated horses and the demonstration of seroconversions in =
horses
  during the period, indicated that these viruses are either enzootic in, o=
r
  annually reintroduced into, Argentina. Antibodies to AG80-646, a new subt=
ype of
  western equine encephalitis (WEE) virus isolated in the subtropical north
  (Chaco Province) from species of Culex, were found in horses and rodents =
in
  that region. The demonstration of seroconversions in sentinel horses and =
of
  antibodies in birds and wild mammals indicates active transmission of
  Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus. In 1980, a new enzootic subty=
pe of
  VEE virus (AG80-663) was isolated from mosquitoes in Chaco; neutralizing
  antibodies to this virus were prevalent in horses and rodents in this are=
a.
  Infections with Aura and Una viruses were most common in the subtropical
  northern provinces. Infection with St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus was
  prevalent and widespread, and birds, principally passerine and columbifor=
m
  species, appear to be the principal hosts. An interesting and unexplained
  finding was the absence of arbovirus antibodies, in particular SLE antibo=
dies
  in house sparrows (Passer domesticus). Antibodies to 2 new virues, Barran=
queras
  and Resistencia, which had been isolated from Culex spp. in Chaco Provinc=
e,
  were found in rodents there. Immunity to Gamboa group viruses was prevale=
nt,
  and birds were implicated as principal hosts.

  ecology of arboviruses in Argentina. In Part I M.S. Sabattini et al. outl=
ine
  previous historical knowledge and describe 3 different climatic/biogeogra=
phic
  study sites (Santa Fe, Corrientes, and Chaco provinces). Parts II (C.J.
  Mitchell et al.) and III (C.H. Calisher et al.) report prospective survey=
s for
  arboviruses during 1977-80. Forty virus strains were isolated, all from
  mosquitoes. The association of Culex delpontei with 18 strains of 4 diffe=
rent
  viruses in Chaco province demonstrates for the first time its importance =
as an
  arbovirus vector. Nineteen strains of Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE=
)
  virus were shown by haemagglutination-inhibition tests and RNA oligonucle=
otide
  fingerprinting to represent a new subtype (VI) of the VEE complex. Simila=
rly, a
  new western equine encephalitis (WEE) virus subtype was shown to differ f=
rom
  the prototype WEE virus by neutralization tests and RNA fingerprinting. O=
ther
  hitherto unrecognized viruses include a new Anopheles A serogroup virus (=
named
  Las Maloyas; shown to be closely related to Lukuni and Col An 57389 virus=
es),
  and 3 new Bunya-like viruses (named Antequera, Barranqueras, and Resisten=
cia;
  all isolated from Cx. delpontei in Chaco province). Eight Gamboa serogrou=

AB: This study was a comparison between fixed-wing aircraft and helicopter
  delivery of the carbamate insecticide propoxur in wettable powder formula=
tion
  suspended in oil (rather than water) against organophosphate- and pyrethr=
oid
  -resistant Culex tarsalis, the vector of encephalitides, in Kern County,
  California (USA). Initial trials indicated that the fixed-wing aircraft, =
which
  flew at 225 k.p.h. at a height of 9 m, was more efficient for large unifo=
rm
  areas, having a larger capacity, being quicker and delivering finer dropl=
ets.
  The tank had a capacity of 1500 l, the spray boom was 11 m in length and =
had 36
  hydraulic nozzles along its length. The helicopter was used to carry an
  underslung Simplex spray system which had a tank capacity of only 570 l. =
The
  system had its own gasoline engine and a 9 m spray boom with 33 nozzles o=
f the
  same type as the fixed-wing aircraft. The helicopter's speed was 93 k.p.h=
. and
  the spray system was again held about 9 m above the ground. This helicopt=
er
  proved particularly useful for small areas of irregular terrain. In both =
cases
  the insecticide formulation was delivered at about 4.7 l/ha giving an
  application rate of about 0.078 kg A.I. (active ingredient)/ha. This dosa=
ge
  killed adult mosquitoes (Cx. tarsalis held in sentinel cages) but not lar=
vae or
  pupae or fish (including the mosquito fish Gambusia affinis). [See also t=

AB: Practical field trials for the aerial application of propoxur for contr=
ol of
  Culex tarsalis [see abstract above] were carried out on 4 occasions in
  different habitats in California (2 foothill sites and a valley). The eff=
ect of
  the trials on mosquito abundance, longevity and virus infection rates, as=
 well
  as on antibody development in sentinel chickens, was assessed. The author=
s
  determined numbers of host-seeking, resting and egressing mosquitoes in b=
oth
  sprayed and unsprayed areas. Female mosquitoes caught were age-graded and
  whether they were fertilized was determined from spermathecal examination=
s.
  Their autogeny status was also assessed. In addition marked mosquitoes we=
re
  released from time to time and recaptures compared from treated and untre=
ated
  sites.Both delivery methods produced significant reductions in mosquito
  abundance and longevity. On the whole, late afternoon sprayings proved mo=
re
  efficient than morning ones because of the proximity of the former to the=
 time
  of nocturnal mosquito activity. Spraying actually spread host-seeking act=
ivity
  to beyond the normal 3 h after sunset. Where the incidence of autogeny wa=
s
  high, changes in parity were less obvious. Population suppression was mor=
e
  pronounced and longer-lasting in semi-isolated foothill sites where recru=
itment
  from immigration was limited. The most significant reduction in mosquito =
virus
  infections was achieved at one of these but transmission was never comple=
tely
  interrupted. The final conclusion is that focal applications can only pro=
duce
  partial control and more needs to be done to increase insecticide applica=
tion
  efficiency.G. Davidson=20

  [The authors] investigated transmission of Japanese encephalitis virus (J=
EV) to
  pigs in southern Thailand. Blood specimens from 100 young pigs at abattoi=
rs in
  3 southern provinces were tested for JEV hemagglutination inhibiting (HAI=
)
  antibodies. Seventy-four percent were positive. Ten seronegative sentinel=
 pigs
  were placed at 5 locations in one southern province [Chumphon]. Seven of =
the 10
  pigs developed JEV HAI and JEV IgM ELISA antibodies within 2 weeks of
  placement. JEV was isolated from all 7 seroconverting sentinel pigs from =
blood
  specimens collected 3 to 11 days after placement. Fifteen light-trap mosq=
uito
  collections at the 5 locations all included known JEV vectors, some in la=
rge
  numbers. [They] conclude that there is intense transmission of JEV to pig=
s in
  southern Thailand despite the rare occurrence of human encephalitis in th=
e same
  regions.[An average of 2 human cases of JE was reported annually from Chu=
mphon
  province for the years 1974-83. In 1983, 1 case of unspecified viral
  encephalitis was reported from Chumphon province (0.3 cases/100 000 popul=

AB: The aquatic fungus Lagenidium giganteum is a facultative pathogen of
  mosquito larvae and is considered to be a promising agent for their biolo=
gical
  control. Although the fungus has been isolated from areas ranging from In=
dia
  and Uganda to the UK and Antartica these strains were not maintained in c=
ulture
  and the 4 isolates in experimental use were all discovered in the tempera=
te
  zone of North America. These 4 isolates may not be suitable for tropical
  mosquito breeding sites; further isolations are therefore needed and the
  authors give a protocol for recognition and isolation of L. giganteum. Th=
ey
  first advise on selection of prospection site and suggest 2 methods for
  detection of fungal pathogens, either microscopic examination of dead or
  moribund specimens resulting from field-caught mosquito larvae held at 25=
 =B0C
  for 48 h or similar examination of sentinel larvae introduced into a
  prospective site for 48 h (detailed line-drawings illustrate a suitable
  container for sentinel larvae). Further line-drawings aid the description=
 of
  how to isolate any fungal pathogens detected in dead mosquito larvae: the
  fungus is first propagated in healthy larvae, individuals of which are th=
en
  surface-sterilized, washed and inoculated on to agar slopes of peptone-ye=
ast
  extract-glucose medium (the method of preparation is given), and the peri=
phery
  of any hyphal growth is subcultured on to fresh medium to obtain a pure
  culture. To aid identification a full page line-drawing of the life-cycle=
 of L.
  giganteum is provided and also 7 photomicrographs.Carolyn A. Brown=20

fsi)
  placed in 16 human water contact sites in the Volta Lake, each month from=
 March
  1973 to November 1977. The results showed that rates of infection were se=
asonal
  and that infected snails were more often found in water contact sites she=
ltered
  by emergent plant growth than in exposed open beach sites with no emergen=
t
  vegetation. Sentinel snail infection rates were correlated with natural s=
nail
  infection rates and with epidemiological levels of schistosomiasis in vil=
lage
  inhabitants. After 2 years of chemotherapy and molusciciding, levels of d=
isease
  and sentinel snail infection rates dropped in two-thirds of the villages.=
 In
  the remaining villages, however, the sentinel snail infection rates were =
not
  correlated with the fall in epidemiological level, because of ecological
  changes in the water contact sites. It is concluded that unless control
  measures are continued, the constant changes in the lake shore environmen=
t will
  lead to a rapid re-establishment of previous levels of disease transmissi=
on.

  ground sprays depended on the distance of the larvae from the point of
  application. R. culicivorax gave up to 46% larval infection, and its incr=

  numbers 3-4 weeks after introduction indicated that a single application =

 was
  able to control Culex populations in rice fields, and continued to multip=

  evidence of SLE infection in several people with central nervous system
  involvement in Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside counties. Previous to th=

E and
  Western equine encephalitis have occurred in California before, no human =
cases
  have been seen in Los Angeles or Orange counties. The age incidence of th=

  cases in 1984 (mostly in persons over 50 years) suggests that endemic SLE
  transmission has not previously occurred in this area before and that
  consequently immunity in the population was low. The identity of the vect=

  sticky aluminium plaques. These trials were undertaken in connection with=
 the
  entomological evaluation of larvicidal treatments carried out in the
  Onchocerciasis Control Programme. It is considered that the use of traps =
gives
  a useful qualitative evaluation by detecting adult populations of various
  physiological stages as compared to the human bait which provides a
  quantitative approach allowing precise determination of the annual biting=
 rate
  and annual transmission potential.The original trap [see Bellec, Trop. Di=
s.
  Bull., 1977, 74, abst. 1246] has been modified by: the addition of a floa=
tation
  and mooring system to the plaque in order to keep it on the water surface
  during sudden floods; the application of self-sticking transparent plasti=
c in
  order to collect quickly all the insects, thus avoiding much handling as =
well
  as permitting good preservation.The results, obtained at the beginning of=
 the
  rainy season, show that the modified trap is easily used. Moreover it per=
mits
  an assessment for a period of 4 or 5 days in at least 8 sites. The trappe=
d
  flies can be identified by species within the Simulium damnosum complex. =
The
  physiological status can be determined and the number of infective third-=
stage
  larvae, indistinguishable from O. volvulus, in the head of females can be
  counted. In these conditions the plaques have played a useful sentinel ro=
le by
  detecting (i) locally bred flies (newly emerged adults) and (ii) migrant =
flies.
  In addition the possible collaboration of villagers has been demonstrated=
 in
  taking care of the placement of the traps after flooding.Further trials o=

TI: The experimental use of 'sentinel' goats to monitor trypanosomiasis in =
a

AB: In 1857 David Livingstone observed that some African tribes in tsetse
  -infected areas could keep no livestock but goats. In 1972 Robson et al.
  reported a natural Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense infection in a goat, an=
d in
  surveys in the Lambwe Valley, Kenya, Trypanozoon infections were found in=
 5 of
  636 goats examined and one of these infections was shown to be, almost
  certainly, T. b. rhodesiense.In a small village in Isoka District, northe=
rn
  Zambia, with a high degree of man-tsetse contact and where 12 cases of sl=
eeping
  sickness were diagnosed among the 70 inhabitants during one year, the pre=
sent
  authors decided to see whether goats might serve to monitor the level of =
T. b.
  rhodesiense challenge during the 8-month absence of the villagers on thei=
r
  rainy-season farms. Six goats were installed in May 1982; all had been pr=
oved
  to be free of trypanosome infection. The goats were examined monthly and =
in
  June all 6 had T. vivax and T. congolense infections. In January 1983 a r=
at
  inoculated from a young goat showed a mixed Trypanozoon/T. congolense inf=
ection
  and a second rat inoculated from the same goat showed only the Trypanozoo=
n.
  Both isolates showed test responses typical of T. b. rhodesiense. When la=
st
  seen in February 1983 all 4 remaining goats (2 had died early in the tria=
l)
  were anaemic but were active with shiny coats and good appetites. This ap=
parent
  trypanotolerance in goats encourages hopes that they could provide meat, =
milk
  and cheese, and perhaps a local hides-and-skin industry in heavily tsetse
  -infested areas. [See also the abstract below.]F.I.C. Apted=20

AB: Repeated outbreaks of Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) in man and
  equines in the Guajira region of Venezuela suggested a sylvatic focus of =
an
  epizootic subtype of VEE virus. Surveillance was established, and virus
  isolations were attempted from 67 760 mosquitoes and sentinel hamsters. S=
ixteen
  isolates of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) and a strain of Itaqui viru=
s were
  recovered from mosquitoes, and 60 isolates of EEE, two of VEE, and two of
  Itaqui viruses were recovered from sentinel hamsters. The VEE virus isola=
tes
  were closely related antigenically to prototype VEE ID and the EEE virus
  isolates were more closely related to the South American than the North
  American variety of EEE virus. Evidence for the presence of VEE and EEE v=
iruses
  in small wild vertebrates was obtained from serological testing. These re=
sults
  showed for the first time, the enzootic presence of both VEE ID and EEE v=
iruses

  sentinel hamsters exposed in the Middle American countries of Mexico,
  Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras were examined for the presence of virions=
 with
  marker characteristics of strains that cause large epidemics and equine
  epizootics. Thirty-four strains came from before and 60 strains came from=
 after
  the Middle American epidemics and equine epizootics of 1966 and 1969-1972=
.
  Twenty-three virion clones that resembled epizootic strains by hydroxyapa=
tite
  chromatography and Vero monkey kidney cell plaque size determinations wer=
e
  characterized further. However, the predominant virions in these clones w=
ere
  like enzootic strains from Middle America north of the Panama Canal regio=
n, and
  not like Middle American epizootic VE strains, since they were in
  hemagglutination-inhibition antigenic subtype IE, usually had optimal pH =
of
  hemagglutination at 6.2, and were avirulent for English shorthair guineap=
igs
  inoculated subcutaneously. These results provide evidence against the the=
ory of
  origin of epidemic-equine epizootic VE virus strains that posits that epi=
zootic
  virions emerge in Middle America from strains containing mixtures of enzo=
otic
  and epizootic virions in enzootic habitats.AS/F.J. Wright=20

AB: No cases of human plague were detected in the Republic of South Africa
  between 1972 and 1982. Over this period surveillance of the sylvatic rese=
rvoir
  was maintained by capture of wild rodents and examination of their sera f=
or
  antibodies to Yersinia pseudotuberculosis pestis. Positive titres were fo=
und in
  7 out of 3012 sera examined. In the northern Cape Province, where there h=
ad
  been a human case in 1971, 5 positive sera were found during subsequent y=
ears
  amongst gerbil species. In the eastern Cape from which human cases had be=
en
  reported in 1972 and 1982 the two positive samples were from grass-living
  Rhabdomys species. It is suggested that these 2 areas contain separate en=
zootic
  foci-the latter extending widely into the northern part of the country an=
d
  adjacent territories. Although rodents are not as useful as carnivores as
  "sentinel indicators" the findings clearly establish the continued presen=

  the disease in the wild rodent population.J.G. Cruickshank=20

AB: In their introduction the authors lament the lack of interest among
  practising physicians and medical schools in occupational disease. The
  physician is at a great disadvantage in the diagnosis of occupational dis=
eases
  owing to an inadequate educational background and low level of suspicion
  regarding their occurrence. The US National Committee on Vital and Health
  Statistics has expressed concern at the absence of procedures to obtain a=
nd
  record occupational data. A table of disease events (known as Sentinel He=
alth
  Events, SHE) has already been developed. SHEs are preventable diseases or
  deaths whose occurrences serve as warning signals that preventive or
  therapeutic methods need improvement. The approach has been successfully =
used
  in the investigation and control of maternal deaths and infant mortality.=
 The
  concept has now been applied to the field of occupational disease. A list=
 of
  Sentinel Health Events (Occupational) has been prepared and reviewed by a=
 panel
  of consultants. The disease condition should be codable according to the =
Ninth
  Revision of the International Classification of Diseases. The authors sug=
gest
  this list of over 50 diseases, which gives the industry or occupation wit=

  papers selected from the first seminar (Environmental epidemiology: gener=

  topics) cover cancer mortality and agricultural activity; a comparison of
  health and environmental statistics between industrialized regions of the
  world; epidemiological surveillance of the health effects of environmenta=
l
  hazards; selected international trends in mortality: 1950-54 to 1970-74
  (Europe, Australia, Canada, USA); and the use of cancer registries for
  environmental research (with the New York State Cancer Registry as an exa=
mple).
  Part II (Environmental health sentinels) contains 7 papers on children as=
 a
  sentinel for respiratory disease in the UK; animal diseases as sentinels =
of
  environmental exposure; detection of long-term health effects; cardiovasc=
ular
  diseases; health sentinels, early warning systems and related activities =
in the
  EEC; use of national and state data systems for occupational health
  surveillance (USA). In Part III (4 papers on Sentinel practices: potentia=
l for
  environmental health monitoring) examples are given of systems in use in =
the UK
  and Netherlands, and of a planned national surveillance system for North
  America which at the time of the seminar in 1981 had not reached fruition=
.
  Finally a seminar on training in epidemiology for occupational physicians
  designed by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and the American
  Occupational Medical Association is described.This book is based on exper=
ience
  in Europe and the USA, but it should be useful for epidemiologists and he=
alth
  administrators everywhere. The examples given show that there is much mor=

  California encephalitis group. Sentinel flocks of domestic fowls were exp=
osed
  in 22 localities; 11 flocks developed antibodies to WEE and 3 to SLE. The
  prospects for 1982 were that high run-off resulting from heavy rainfall a=
nd
  snowfall during the winter of 1981-82 would give conditions favourable to
  excessive mosquito breeding, and that extensive surveillance and control
  measures would be necessary to prevent epidemics of encephalitis in Calif=

tinel
  mice and hamsters, and from Culex sacchettae Sirivanakarn & Jakob, C. tae=
niopus
  D. & K. and C. epanastasis Dyar, all of the subgenus Melanoconion, collec=
ted in
  coastal Brazil in the State of Sao Paulo. Identifications of 22 of these =
36
  viruses have been reported. Six of the remaining 14 isolates were shown t=
o be
  Guama serogroup bunyaviruses. Two of these 6were strains of a newly recog=
nised
  virus for which the name Cananeia virus is proposed; another is a second =
newly
  recognised Guama serogroup virus for which the name Itimirim virus is pro=
posed;
  a fourth is a strain of Bertioga virus and the other 2 are strains of Gua=
ratuba
  virus. Before these studies Guaratuba virus was considered an ungrouped
  bunyavirus, but cross-testing by complement-fixation demonstrated that th=
is
  virus, and Mirim virus as well, should be considered members of the Guama
  serogroup. Another 6 viruses were shown to be strains of a single, newly
  recognised Group C bunyavirus for which the name Bruconha virus is propos=
ed.
  Two strains of a single virus were shown by electron microscopy to belong=
 to
  the family Bunyaviridae, but serological relationships with other members=
 of
  this family of viruses were not found; the name Enseada virus is proposed=
 for
  this newly recognised agent.

AB: Concluding results of a 10-year schistosomiasis control programme in Cu=

  Sac valley, Saint Lucia, are described. After an area-wide mollusciciding
  campaign (1970 to 1975), and a surveillance/treatment programme supplemen=
ted
  with selective population chemotherapy in 1975 and 1976, prevalence rates=
 of S.
  mansoni were reduced to low levels. To prevent a resurgence of transmissi=
on a
  cost-effective routine focal mollusciciding programme, suitable for publi=
c
  health implementation was evaluated from 1977 to 1981. Streams and main
  collector drains in banana fields, considered to be potential S. mansoni
  transmission sites, were treated every 4 weeks with Bayluscide 6076
  emulsifiable concentrate (Clonitralide). Snail populations were controlle=
d in
  the treated areas but large numbers were present where no treatment was g=
iven.
  Only 0.06% of sentinel snails became infected. Prevalence of infection in=
 the
  human population remained low (over-all 5%) and intensity of infection at=
 a
  level not normally associated with schistosomal disease. Since control st=
arted
  10 years earlier the level of potential contamination has fallen by 92% i=
n high
  transmission areas. The 4 year programme cost US$12 909, of which 54% was=
 for
  molluscicide, 27% for labour and 19% for transport, equipment and sundrie=
s. The
  average annual cost per head of population was US$0.46. [AS]

  Fifteen were pure bred and 3 were mixed. This age, sex, and breed distrib=
ution
  was different from the total canine hospital population. A cancer and non
  -cancer control, each matched to a case by age at diagnosis, year of admi=
ssion,
  sex and breed, were selected. Sixteen owners of cases and 32 controls wer=
e
  interviewed to determine their occupation and smoking habits, and their d=
og's
  medical history, lifestyle, diet and exposure to asbestos. Results were
  analyzed using a matched technique for each control separately and combin=
ed
  controls. A significant odds ratio was found with an asbestos-related
  occupation. Analysis of lung tissue from two cases revealed prominent
  accumulations of asbestos fibres. Implications of this sentinel model are
  discussed.

AB: The history and epidemiology of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), which in
  Europe was first observed in the USSR, is briefly reviewed. Although the
  disease was not certainly known in Italy, some human individuals in north=
ern
  Italy and some goats in central Italy were found in serological studies t=
o
  contain antibodies to TBE, and in 1975 2 patients in hospital in Florence=
 had
  acute symptoms of meningoencephalitis typical of TBE. Investigations were
  therefore begun in the Province of Firenze into the fauna, flora and clim=
ate of
  the region and into the possibility of isolating the virus from vectors o=
r
  reservoirs present there. The fauna consisted mainly of wild rodents but =
also
  included foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in both northern and southern sections of =
the
  study region. Ticks collected from both sections consisted of Rhipicephal=
us
  sanguineus (Latr.) R. bursa C. & F. and Ixodes ricinus (L.); the developm=
ent of
  the last species was favoured by the climate. In the northern section onl=
y, 2
  women and a fox were found positive for TBE, and antibodies were found in=
 20%
  of 1 of 3 flocks of sheep examined and also in a sentinel flock sent into=
 the
  same locality. In the southern section, antibodies to Bhanja virus (norma=
lly
  transmitted by Haemaphysalis punctata C. & F.) were found in indigenous s=
heep,
  but neither this virus nor TBE was found in sentinel sheep, wild animals =
or
  man. Examination of ticks from both sections showed that I. ricinus from =
the
  southern section contained Tribec virus (which had been isolated twice be=
fore
  in Italy and was also known in Romania and Slovakia). In the northern sec=
tion,
  females of I. ricinus from one locality contained TBE, the first strain t=
o be
  isolated from ticks in Italy, and 2 males of R. bursa in a different loca=
lity
  contained 2 strains of Bhanja virus. It is concluded that a natural focus=
 of
  TBE exists in the north of the Province of Firenze, with a second possibl=
e
  'risk' area, and that subclinical infections previously observed there we=
re
  probably due to TBE. The probable existence of foci of tick-borne Bhanja =
virus
  in the north and of Tribec virus in the south (although the indications a=
re not
  so definite) further demonstrate the necessity of continued surveillance =
and
  further investigation of tick-borne viruses in the Province of Firenze.

  (WEE) or St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) were found in man in California, bu=
t 1
  case of SLE was found in Nevada. Of 25 equines tested serologically for W=
EE,
  only 2 cases were confirmed. A total of 3760 pools of mosquitoes (177 839
  individuals) was collected, of which most consisted either of Culex tarsa=
lis
  Coq. or of members of the species-complex of C. pipiens L.; 73 isolations=
 were
  made of WEE, 13 of SLE, 77 of Hart Park virus, 48 of Turlock virus and 11=
 of
  the California encephalitis group. Sentinel flocks of domestic fowls were
  distributed to 31 localities; 15% developed antibodies to WEE in the Sacr=
amento
  Valley, the San Joaquin Valley and southern California. These results
  demonstrated a substantial fall in the rates of infection with these mosq=

AB: Following the final chemotherapy campaign of a 4-year programme, the
  biological assessment of transmission of S. mansoni was evaluated for 5 y=
ears.
  No infected Biomphalaria glabrata were found amongst 28 791 and 13 550 sn=
ails
  examined from flowing and static index sites, respectively. However, 89
  infected snails among 16 602 examined (0.54%) were found from additional =
sites.
  Sentinel snails examined between March 1974 and October 1977 revealed no
  infection and their use was discontinued. Following an increase in
  intransmission routine focal mollusciciding at 4-week intervals was intro=
duced
  in March 1980. The cost for 8 applications was US$641, representing a
  cost/caput of $0.21. These figures, extrapolated to a full year's control=
,
  become $1,042 and $0.35, respectively. The maximum cost was for the
  molluscicide, which absorbed 71.5% of the total. The data suggest that th=
e main
  transmission of S. mansoni occurs in the dry season, in flowing habitats,=
 as it
  does elsewhere in St. Lucia. [AS]

AB: A new member of the Simbu group of arboviruses, for which the name Peat=
on
  virus is proposed, was isolated from ceratopogonids and cattle in Austral=
ia.
  Nine isolates were obtained from 101 pools of Culicoides brevitarsis Kief=
f.
  Collected at Peachester, Queensland, between 30 November and 8 December 1=
976.
  Three isolations of the same virus were made from the blood of sentinel c=
attle
  collected at Grafton and Tamworth, New South Wales, on 20 January and 13 =
April
  1977, respectively. Peaton virus was shown to be a member of the Simbu gr=
oup by
  complement-fixation tests using antisera prepared against Australian stra=
ins of
  Akabane and Aino viruses. It was readily distinguishable from these virus=
es in
  cross-neutralisation tests in tissue cultures and mice. A serological sur=
vey of
  sentinel cattle showed that neutralising antibody was detectable only in =
cattle
  within the recorded limits of the suspected vector, C. brevitarsis.
  Neutralising antibody in blood serum was detected in 22 of 157 sheep, 21 =
of 137
  horses, 7 of 18 buffaloes, 7 of 20 goats and 3 of 62 pigs, but not in 22
  camels, 34 dogs, 3 cats, 76 human beings, 240 marsupials, 19 reptiles or =
31
  wild birds. The Yale Arbovirus Research Unit and the Center for Disease
  Control, Fort Collins, USA, found that Peaton virus was distinguishable f=
rom
  all other Simbu group viruses and thus is a new virus.

ped
  alive was processed in 283 pools. Suspensions were inoculated into cell
  cultures of Aedes albopictus (Skuse) and into suckling mice. A total of 1=

  encephalitis virus by mouse inoculation were all from the mosquitoes coll=
ected
  during the period between 20 and 30 June, when all 6 sentinel pigs were

  of the postparasitic stage were made at Riverside in California in 1977 a=

sed by
  daily exposure of sentinel larvae of Culex pipiens L. or Anopheles freebo=

  Aitken, but the mosquitoes were not allowed to breed. Production of infec=
tive
  stages was lower in 1978 than in 1979, but the ability of the nematode to
  persist for at least 15 months through 2 mosquito seasons was demonstrate=
d;
  this was largely due to variable development rates that in turn probably
  depended on genetic heterogeneity within the nematode population. Althoug=
h the
  optimum average temperature for the development of the postparasitic stag=
e was
  27 deg C, R. culicivorax was able to overwinter in California and resumed
  activity in the preparasitic stage when the soil temperature reached 12-1=
3 deg

  Antibody responses were measured by the microneutralisation test employin=
g 4
  California group viruses: LAC, snowshoe hare, Trivittatus and Jamestown C=
anyon.
  Four of 6 sentinel red foxes developed LAC virus neutralising antibody.
  Antibody titres peaked between days 7 and 34 and were still detectable by=
 day
  345 after infection. Homologous LAC virus antibody titres were consistent=
ly 4
  -fold or more greater than heterologous titres. Serological evidence for
  natural LAC virus infection was demonstrated in 33 of 57 (58%) free-rangi=
ng red
  foxes, 18 of 32 (57%) gray foxes, and 4 of 16 (25%) racoons. Antibody tit=

antly
  different (P < 0.001) for foxes trapped in 3 distinct areas within the en=

 only
  5 were verified treatment failures. Of the 141 apparently new infections,=
 103
  had had a positive faecal examination in 1971 or 1972 and probably repres=

  old, light infections. Of the 38 positive for the first time in 1974, onl=
y 14
  were less than 15 years old. Of 156 people treated in 1974, 21.2% vomited=
. The
  over-all reduction in prevalence was from 25% in 1973 to 7% in 1974. Ther=
e was
  a significant reduction in incidence of new infections. The community egg
  excretion, or contamination potential was reduced by 63%. No naturally in=
fected
  snails have been found in the area since chemotherapy started and sentine=
l
  snails have not become infected. The cost/person protected in the control
  scheme area was $1.34 in the first year and $0.81 in the 2nd.

ning
  waters were treated 3 times during the first operational year (1968) and
  thereafter (monthly until December 1974) focal applications were made whe=
re
  snails were found. The mollusciciding reduced all the parameters used for
  evaluating the disease (up to 1974) : incidence, prevalence, faecal egg c=
ounts,
  snail populations (dynamics and infection rate) and the infectivity of na=
tural
  water bodies (as measured by the exposure on sentinel mice). Less pronoun=
ced
  reductions in these parameters occurred in the untreated control area. De=
spite
  the benefits of the mollusciciding, there was no evidence that transmissi=
on had
  been interrupted and prevalence and incidence rates tended to stabilize a=
fter
  1972. The total cost of the project was US$ 381 181, most (80.8%) going t=

 Notes

  and on the effect of climatic conditions on its flight; it was most abund=
ant in
  July-September and flew mainly at humidities above 90% RH, especially in =
rain,

  20 deg C or humidities below 90% RH. Host preferences were found to chang=

  abruptly from birds to mammals in May or June and back to birds in Decemb=
er.
  Epidemiological tendencies that were beginning to emerge and give cause f=
or
  concern as a result of a state-wide surveillance system operating in 1978=
 are
  outlined, including sentinel chickens and mammalian sera found positive f=

e
  necessity for maintaining the surveillance programme at a level comparabl=

AB: In this review of the past and future research work of the Department o=
f
  Biomedical and Environmental Health Sciences, California University, on
  mosquito-borne encephalitis viruses, attention is drawn to the drastic
  reduction of populations of Culex tarsalis Coq. and Aedes melanimon Dyar =
and
  therefore of the incidence of western equine encephalitis (WEE) and St. L=
ouis
  encephalitis (SLE), which led to the direction of department research tow=
ards
  vector competence, vector genetics and statistical models of variable fac=
tors
  affecting the control of vectors, rather than towards actual control meas=
ures.
  Attention is also drawn to the resurgence of C. tarsalis in 1978, as indi=
cated
  by light-trap catches in the California Imperial Valley and by the incide=
nce of
  WEE in flocks of sentinel chickens, and the number of human encephalitis =
cases
  likely to occur in the next few years is deduced. In view of the unexpect=
ed
  official limiting of state funds available for mosquito control, the
  possibility of an incidence of encephalitis at rates comparable to those =
of the
  1950s must be envisaged, and the author recommends that a large proportio=
n of
  the limited funds now available should be used for a selective programme =
of
  control, not against the larvae as in the past, but against the older adu=
lt
  females of C. tarsalis that are current or potential vectors of encephali=
tis
  viruses, in order to break the transmission cycle as rapidly as possible.

  symptoms of encephalitis. Isolation of virus and serological evidence of =
Rocio
  virus infection in a significant proportion of the encephalitis patients
  suggested that Rocio virus was the aetiological agent of the epidemic. Ro=
cio
  virus was isolated only from patients who died within 5 days of onset of
  illness. The virus was also isolated from two sentinel mice exposed to bl=
ood
  -sucking insects in the epidemic zone and from a rufous collared sparrow

AB: Tonate and Cabassou viruses, which are 2 arboviruses of the Venezuelan
  equine encephalitis (VEE) complex, were frequently isolated from mosquito=
es,
  from sentinel infant mice and from wild vertebrates in French Guiana in 1=
973
  -77. Using these data and comparing them with the results of previous wor=
k
  cited in the literature, a study was made of the epidemiology of these vi=
ruses
  with reference to the biology of these vectors. Of the 16 species of Culi=
cidae
  and a few of Phlebotominae that were found to harbour one or both of the
  viruses, the species most commonly infected were found to be Culex portes=
i
  Senevet & Abonnenc and, to a lesser extent, Coquillettidia venezuelensis
  (Theo.).The activity cycles, seasonal variations in density and populatio=
n age
  in relation to the biting activity and vector potential of these species,
  especially Culex portesi, are examined in detail, and conclusions are dra=
wn on
  the hypothetical epidemiological cycle of the viruses. Both mosquito spec=
ies
  were mainly nocturnal [see RAE/B 67, 832] and therefore active at the tim=
e that
  rodents and marsupials were becoming active, while birds (the other verte=
brates
  from which these viruses were isolated) were already roosting. The season=
al
  incidence of the mosquitoes appeared to vary according to rainfall and to=
 its
  effect on the larval habitats (small semi-permanent pools for Culex, aqua=
tic
  plants in permanent marshes for Coquillettidia); a monthly rainfall of 15=
0-350
  mm was favourable. Sudden cessation of the rains in July-August 1976 resu=
lted
  in outbreaks of both species, which were terminated by 2.5 months of drou=
ght
  until October. It was noted however that virus incidence, especially in C=
.
  venezuelensis, did not always correspond with high population density.The
  physiological age of Culex females influenced their biting cycle but this=
 did
  not necessarily affect virus transmission. The proportion of parous femal=
es was
  related to the population dynamics, which in turn were related to rainfal=
l; in
  favourable conditions, over 90% of the Culex females caught were parous,
  whereas the proportion of parous Coquillettidia females never seemed grea=
ter
  than 60%. The epidemiology of the viruses appeared to consist of 2 transm=
ission
  cycles, alternating according to the season; the first, an epizootic cycl=
e
  mainly on mammals at the beginning of the rainy season or beginning of th=
e dry
  season, when dense populations of Culex portesi, with a high proportion o=
f
  parous females, were present, followed by a second, an enzootic cycle mai=
nly on
  birds during the middle and end of the rainy season and during the dry se=
ason,
  when populations of C. portesi were low with a low proportion of parous f=
emales.

d in
  upstate New York during the summer of 1976, with 37 cases confirmed in ho=
rses
  by isolation of virus and/or by serological examination. Other specimens

 pools
  of 33 365 mosquitoes, five from tissues of 64 birds, and two from four se=
ntinel
  pheasants with serological conversions. EEE antibodies were also detected=
 in 81
  of 499 wild birds. Data implicated sparrows, cowbirds, and catbirds in th=

  amplification of EEE virus and Culiseta melanura mosquitoes as vectors am=
ong
  birds. A modified serological technique involving haemagglutination reduc=
tion
  gave reliable diagnoses of EEE as early as 24 hours after receipt of fiel=

AB: The purpose of this report is to describe isolations of Venezuelan (VEE=
) and
  eastern (EEE) equine encephalitis virus made in the lowland moist tropica=
l
  forest of the Catatumbo region on the south-western part of the State of =
Zulia,
  Venezuela. Culex declarator D. & K., C. dunni Dyar and species of the sub=
genus
  Melanoconion of Culex were the most abundant mosquitoes present, and
  Phlebotomus spp. were also found. Four strains of VEE virus were isolated=
 from
  sentinel hamsters exposed at Cano Mocho and Madre Vieja sites in 1973 and=
 1974,
  and three strains of EEE virus in Hacienda (Hda.) Las Nubes in 1975. Both
  viruses were recovered during silent interepidemic periods, and it is bel=
ieved
  that these viruses are maintained in this region in sylvatic conditions. =
The
  recovered virus strains were detected within 24 to 48 h, both in SMB and =
Vero
  Cell monolayer cultures, and the sentinel hamsters yielded virus infectiv=
ities
  up to 104 PFU ml. The VEE isolate (IVIC PAn 23645-47), recovered during t=
he
  silent interepizodemic period had an elution profile on the hydroxylapati=
te
  column corresponding to that of a I-D (VEEV-3880) or a I-E (VEEV-63A216)
  'enzootic' subtype. However, considering other in vitro criteria (KHI; HA=
 pH
  5.8-6.0; small plaque size in Vero monolayers with suitable overlay media=
),
  this latter and other previous isolates had some very distinct properties=
 of
  the 'epizootic' strains. Thus, the evidence suggests that in Venezuela th=
e VEE
  virus cycle in nature is maintained either by the so called 'enzootic' an=
d/or
  'epizootic' virus types, or the virus population of the isolates have
  particular in vitro properties which do not correlate to the virulence ma=
rkers
  in vivo. It is considered that this important question must be further
  clarified, and in addition, the isolation of three strains of EEE are rep=
orted;
  this is the first report of the presence of this virus in Venezuela. Alth=
ough
  the EEE isolates may be of the South American type, they must be consider=
ed as
  potentially dangerous.

  tourists and sportsmen after visits to national parks and safari areas of=
 East,
  Central and Southern Africa. The patients have often been exposed to the
  vectors, Glossina spp., for only a few hours, so it is easy to determine =
the
  day, and even in some cases the hour, of the infective bite. The subjects=
 are
  without any immunological competence and so constitute an unusual type of
  sentinel host. The vectors may carry a zoonosis from game that is poorly
  adapted to man or may transmit heavy infections that were collected from =
park
  wardens who act as carriers. The course of the disease is so critical tha=
t it
  has become an urgent problem. Specific treatment needs to be planned very
  carefully and individually if disastrous, and even fatal, reactions are t=
o be
  avoided.

  streams. All parameters of infection fell - incidence from 31 to 12%,
  prevalence among under-14-year-olds from 47 to 42% and the sentinel snail
  infection rate from 0.5 to 0.2%. In a nearby area with a communal water s=
upply
  S. mansoni prevalence increased. In Marquis Valley, hycanthone at 2.5 mg/=
kg
  body-weight was offered to all found infected at survey in 1973 and 1974;=
 those
  found infected in 1975 were given oxamniquine. After 2 chemotherapy campa=
igns
  incidence fell from 18.8 to 4.1%; no infections were found in sentinel or=
 wild
  snails after the first treatment campaign. After 2 years of control,
  chemotherapy reduced incidence from 18.8 to 4%; snail control, from 22 to=
 9.8%;
  and water supplies, from 22.7 to 11.3%. Annual costs/capita in the first =
2
  years were $1.10 (chemotherapy), $3.70 (snail control) and $4.00 (water
  supplies). Chemotherapy most rapidly achieved transmission control and
  additionally provided disease control. [AS]

AB: Studies on the incidence of eastern equine encephalitis virus were star=
ted
  in 1961 at 3 field stations in forested areas near the city of Sao Paulo,
  Brazil. The virus was isolated in 1969-71 from various resident birds and=
 from
  Oryzomys and Didelphis marsupialis and sentinel mice, and once, in 1970, =
from a
  pool of Phoniomyia pilicauda (Root). This was the first isolation of this=
 virus
  from mosquitos in southern Brazil. It is not thought that P. pilicauda ca=
n be
  involved in epizootics as it is a forest species and the epizootics occur=
red in
  open country. Isolations of the virus were made at all seasons. None was =
made
  after 1971. No epizootic in horses has been reported in Sao Paulo since 1=
966.
  It is assumed that the virus is not endemic in the region as no evidence =
of
  overt illness in man was seen, although there was serological evidence of
  infection.

  of Mansonia and Aedes one each. Species of the subgenus Melanoconion of C=
ulex
  and Aedes taeniorhynchus (Wied.) were most prevalent near the
  marsh.Haemagglutination-inhibition and neutralisation antibody tests show=
ed
  that wild terrestrial mammals (opossums and rodents), man and dogs, but n=

  an 18-month period between September 1971 and february 1973. Only 1 of 5
  sentinel rabbits, and none of 30 sentinel chickens developed antibody to =
VEE
  during August-September 1971 when virus activity was readily detected by =
the
  use of sentinel hamsters. Five strains of group C arboviruses (one identi=

in of
  Nepuyo virus was isolated from the blood of a person with a febrile illne=

AB: Three strains of Banzi virus, 54 of Germiston virus and 55 of Witwaters=
rand
  virus were isolated from hamsters exposed as virus sentinels at 2 localit=
ies
  (Port Shepstone and Lake Insese) in Natal, South Africa, and 1 in central
  Mozambique [cf. preceding abstract]. Five surviving hamsters had antibodi=
es to
  Banzi virus and 1 to Germiston virus. Infection frequencies per 100 hamst=
er
  -days of exposure varied from 0.17 to 7.7 with Germiston virus and from 0=
.17 to
  8.4 with Witwatersrand virus. It seemed likely that recorded infection
  frequencies of Banzi virus were not representative of actual infections b=
ecause
  of mortality among Banzi-infected hamsters caused by Germiston and
  Witwatersrand viruses. At both study sites in South Africa, the hamsters =
were
  exposed in areas where Culex rubinotus Theo. was shown at the time to be
  infected with the same viruses, and it is concluded that C. rubinotus was=
 the
  cause of the infections in the hamster. In Mozambique, some infections in
  hamsters occurred during the dry season. One strain of Banzi virus was is=
olated
  from Praomys natalensis from Mozambique. Two sera from P. natalensis from=
 South
  Africa contained antibodies to Banzi virus and another 2 sera had antibod=
ies to
  Witwatersrand virus. It is concluded that wild rodents are the vertebrate
  maintenance hosts of these viruses.

AB: A virus surveillance project was established and maintained during 1972
  along 10 major river drainages in Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Oklahoma=
,
  Texas and Louisiana. Mosquitoes and ceratopogonids were collected in CDC =
light
  -traps and blood specimens from sentinel equines during 83 visits to 141
  arthropod collecting sites and 22 sentinel locations from April-December =
1972.
  A total of 173 074 mosquitoes was tested, and 303 arboviruses were isolat=
ed
  from 11 of 41 species; 227 of the isolations were from Culex tarsalis Coq=
., the
  most abundant species. From 13 388 ceratopogonids tested, 8 arbovirus
  isolations were obtained from 1 of 5 species (Culicoides variipennis (Coq=
.)).
  There was no isolation of Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus. Wes=
tern
  equine encephalitis (WEE) virus isolates were the most numerous and were
  followed by Turlock, St. Louis encephalitis, Hart Park, California
  encephalitis, and Bunyamwera group viruses. The first isolation of WEE fr=
om the
  mosquito Culex erraticus (D. & K.) is reported, as is the extension of th=
e
  ranges for Buttonwillow virus from California to New Mexico and Texas. Al=
so, a
  single isolation of the Bunyamwera group from Culicoides variipennis exte=
nds
  the range of this virus-vector relationship from California to Texas. New
  distribution records for mosquito species previously unknown in Arizona,
  Louisiana, New Mexico, and Oklahoma are reported. The sentinel burros det=
ected
  WEE serological conversions at two sites in New Mexico and at one in Texa=
s. The
  surveillance project provided current information on the status of arbovi=
rus
  activity, including the absence of VEE activity during 1972, and it
  demonstrated the existence of the potential for WEE epizootics and epidem=
ics

e the
  prevalence rate of California-group virus antibodies in sera of several
  vertebrate species. Serum samples were tested for neutralising antibody i=
n a
  microneutralisation system with baby hamster kidney cell culture. Of 77 s=
era
  tested, 21 neutralised Trivittatus virus. The antibody prevalence rate wa=
s
  highest for eastern cottontail rabbits inasmuch as 10 of 22 serum samples=
 from

ving
  Trivittatus virus antibody included the fox squirrel (7 of 24), opossum (=

ised
  both Trivittatus and Jamestown Canyon viruses, and one serum sample from
  opossum neutralised Jamestown Canyon virus. None of the vertebrate sera
  neutralised La Crosse, St. Louis encephalitis or western equine encephali=

 of
  sentinel rabbits, and the virus was isolated from the blood collected fro=

AB: During the wet seasons of 1972 and possibly 1971, sentinel horses becam=
e
  infected by Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus in a temporally an=
d
  geographically progressive manner inland from an enzootic marsh focus of =
virus
  on the Pacific coast of south-eastern Guatemala [cf. preceding abstract].
  During the wet seasons of 1972 and 1973, VEE virus was detected by sentin=
el
  horses (and a sentinel hamster in 1972) in a small wood 10 km north of th=
e
  marsh, but the virus was undetectable there during the dry seasons of 197=
3 and
  1974 and the wet season of 1974. Species of the subgenus Melanoconion of =
Culex
  were found in this wood and at the marsh during August 1973. These observ=
ations
  are compatible with movement of VEE virus from the marsh habitat during s=
ome
  wet seasons. However, virus activity in this region adjacent to the marsh=
 was
  quantitatively unpredictable on a yearly basis and occurred in only very =
focal
  habitats in 1971-74. The mechanisms of VEE virus movement from the marsh =
are
  currently unknown, but bats are under study as a likely possibility.

AB: Sentinel pigs were bled and mosquitoes were collected for isolation of
  Japanese encephalitis virus between 1969 and 1973 in a rural area of nort=
hern
  Taiwan with a high annual incidence of human cases. The study site includ=
ed a
  farmyard, schools, a bat cave, rice-fields and a heronry. Although Culex
  vishnui Theo. (annulus Theo.) was collected in every month of the year,
  isolations were made only in midsummer and only from C. vishnui (17 isola=
tions)
  and C. tritaeniorhynchus Giles (one). These isolates were usually collect=
ed
  from pigs. In each year, cases in man near the study site were reported 3=
 to 5
  weeks after the initial isolations from sentinel pigs. Isolations were ma=
de
  only for 4 to 8 weeks each summer. The isolation of the virus was not rel=
ated
  to the availability of susceptible pigs or the spring or summer peaks in
  prevalence of C. vishnui. Despite periodic draining of rice-fields and th=
e
  application of insecticides, sufficient numbers of C. vishnui were availa=
ble to
  support transmission of the virus in each year of the study.

AB: Evidence was sought in 1970-75 of persistence of Venezuelan equine
  encephalitis (VEE) virus in regions of Central America that were heavily
  involved in the epidemic and equine epizootic of 1969. Four sentinel hors=
es
  were exposed in an arid, upland region of the Atlantic drainage of Guatem=
ala in
  August-October 1970, but none became infected. The epicentre region of th=
e 1969
  outbreak, in south-eastern Guatemala and south-western El Salvador, was s=
tudied
  from July 1970 to February 1974; no antibody developed in sentinel horses=
,
  sentinel hamsters did not die, mosquitoes yielded no virus and wild rats =
had no
  detectable antibody to VEE virus. Unexplained decreases in populations of=
 wild
  terrestrial mammals possibly limited the maintenance of the virus. Howeve=
r,
  mosquitoes (particularly species of Culex) were plentiful and present in =
the
  same species composition found at a focus of enzootic VEE virus about 35 =
km
  north-west of the epicentre region. In studies at two Guatemalan ranches =
near
  the epicentre, where horses died in 1969, VEE virus was isolated from sen=
tinel
  horses along one of three lakes on one ranch during the wet season of 197=
2 but
  not during the dry or wet seasons of 1973; the titres of neutralising
  antibodies in these 4 horses were higher against an enzootic strain of VE=
E
  virus than against an epizootic strain. In 1970 and 1971, VEE virus was
  isolated from sentinel hamsters exposed at a marsh on the other ranch, bu=
t Vero
  plaque characteristics were those of enzootic VEE virus. The only epizoot=
ic
  activity of VEE virus discovered in Central America in 1970-1975 occurred=
 in
  Nicaragua between April and June 1972. Several hundred horses died, and
  neutralising antibody, like that engendered by epizootic virus, was found=
 in 2
  young, unvaccinated horses. Whether this represented persistence of epizo=
otic
  VEE virus or the reintroduction of virus is unknown.

AB: Ecological studies were conducted in 1970 to investigate the role of th=
e
  eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus) as a vertebrate host for LaCrosse viru=
s in
  nature during late summer when Aedes triseriatus (Say) is most abundant.
  Movement, home range and density of chipmunk populations were determined =
by
  mark and recapture techniques. The seasonal abundance of A. triseriatus w=
as
  estimated by use of oviposition traps. Passive antibodies to this virus w=
ere
  found in spring-born juvenile chipmunks captured before mid-July and in s=
ummer
  -born juveniles in September. Active antibodies neutralising LaCrosse vir=
us
  were first detected in susceptible chipmunks in mid-July, and 68 free-liv=
ing
  and 4 sentinel animals developed antibodies during the study. Virus
  transmission continued at a high rate during August but was not detected =
in
  September. Chipmunk habitat was ranked for quality and populations of
  chipmunks. A. triseriatus was more abundant in study areas that had the m=
ost
  suitable chipmunk habitat. The rise and fall in population of A. triseria=
tus
  were associated with the rise and fall in the elaboration of antibodies i=
n
  chipmunks. In one study area, antibody prevalence rates in adult and spri=
ng
  -born juveniles reached 100% by September. The findings implicate A.
  triseriatus as the vector and establish chipmunks as important amplifying=
 hosts
  in discontinuous foci of virus transmission.

Of 599
  blood-meals of A. trivittatus tested, 409 were of rabbit origin. Of 77 se=

  antibodies against Trivittatus virus, including 10 of 22 sera of eastern

  in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Bertioga was isolated from sentinel mice exposed in=
 a
  forest of that name, and was shown to belong serologically to the Guama g=
roup
  of arboviruses. Anhembi virus was isolated from a pool of females of Phon=
iomyia
  pilicauda (Root) and one of Trichoprosopon pallidiventer (Lutz) and from =
a
  spiny rat (Proechimys iheringi); it was shown to be a new member of the
  Bunyamwera group. The viruses are sensitive to sodium desoxycholate and a=
re
  filterable through a millipore membrane of 450 mu m pore size. Both are
  pathogenic for suckling mice and grow well in Vero cells, producing clear
  cytopathic effects. Detailed antigenic comparisons of Anhembi virus with =
other
  members of the Bunyamwera group isolated in the Americas, and of Bertioga=
 virus
  with the members of the Guama group are presented.

zomyia
  flaviscutellata (Mangabeira) collected from rodent-baited traps in the fo=
rests
  of Belem, Para, Brazil between October 1968 and September 1970. Isolation=

f two
  wild rodents (Oryzomys) but not from 424 examples of L. infraspinosa
  (Mangabeira), 12 000 mosquitos or sentinel mice. Neutralising antibodies =
of
  Pacui virus were detected in the serum of six bait animals that had been
  exposed to biting flies in the forest, in 30% of wild rodents surveyed
  (including two from Amapa Territory), and in 10% of marsupials, but were =
absent
  from man and bats. L. flaviscutellata was most abundant in the dry season=
, when
  the number of Pacui virus isolations increased. This Phlebotomine is stro=
ngly
  attracted to rodents close to the ground. L. flaviscutellata also yielded
  single strains of Guama, Icoaraci and BeAr 177325 viruses.

  California, revealed that wild mammals had been infected with several
  arboviruses. Seven strains of virus were recovered from 1889 blood sample=

  strain of western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE) virus was isolated from
  Ammospermophilus nelsoni and one from Mus musculus, 3 strains of Buttonwi=
llow
  virus from Sylvilagus audubonii and 1 from Lepus californicus, and 1 stra=
in of
  an adenovirus from Peromyscus maniculatus. No virus was isolated from 131=
4
  ticks or 1795 fleas collected on mammals or in burrows. Based on
  haemagglutination-inhibition tests, antibodies to WEE virus were frequent=
 in L.
  californicus but rare in other species. Antibodies to St. Louis encephali=
tis
  (SLE), Powassan and Modoc viruses, but not to Rio Bravo virus, were wides=
pread.
  The yearly prevalence of antibodies to any one group-B arbovirus varied.
  Antibody to SLE virus decreased and antibody to Powassan virus increased =
during
  the five years. Antibody rates to WEE virus in L. californicus fluctuated=
 in
  the same manner as viral infection rates in Culex tarsalis Coq. and immun=

  leporispalustris (Pack.) from hares. The virus was also isolated from the
  snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), varying lemming (Dicrostonyx rubricatus=
),
  northern red-backed vole (Clethrionomys rutilus) and sentinel rabbits.
  Silverwater virus was isolated from H. leporispalustris. Northway virus w=
as
  isolated from one pool of each A. hexodontus, Culiseta alaskaensis (Ludl.=
), of
  A. excrucians and of mosquitos of the complex of A. punctor. Pasteurella
  (Francisella) tularensis was isolated from hares and from H. leporispalus=
tris.
  Great Island virus and a virus of the Sakhalin group were isolated from I=
xodes
  signatus Bir. collected from common murres (Uria aalge) from near Homer o=
n the
  Kenai Peninsula; neither has been recorded previously in Alaska. Some of =
the
  other viruses were also isolated from small mammals.

AB: There have been intermittent epidemics and epizootics in equines of
  Venezuelah equine encephalitis virus on the dry Pacific coastal plain of =
Peru
  since at least the 1930's. However, evidence that the virus exists in the
  Amazon region of Peru to the east of the Andes was not obtained until
  antibodies were found in human sera collected in 1965. Ten strains of the=
 virus
  were isolated in a forest near the city of Iquitos on the Amazon in easte=
rn
  Peru during February and March 1971. Eight strains were from female mosqu=
itos
  and two from dead sentinel hamsters. Three hamsters exposed in forests ne=
ar
  Iquitos developed antibodies to Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus sugg=
esting
  that hamster-benign strains also exist there. Antibody tests of equine se=
ra
  revealed no evidence that the virus was actively circulating during the l=
ate
  1950's or 1960's in southern coastal Peru, where equine epizootics had oc=
curred
  in the 1930's and 1940's. In northern coastal Peru on the border with Ecu=
ador,
  antibodies were found in equine sera, presumably resulting from the 1969
  outbreak caused by subtype I virus, since neutralising antibody titres we=
re
  higher to subtype I virus than to subtypes III or IV. No activity of the =
virus
  was detected in this northern region during the dry season of 1970 by use=
 of
  sentinel hamsters. The possibility is considered that epidemics and equin=
e
  epizootics on the Pacific coast of Peru are caused by movements of the vi=
rus in
  infected vertebrates traversing Andean passes or in infected vertebrates =
or
  mosquitos carried in aeroplanes from the Amazon region.

  slightly anthropophilous and a vector of Leishmania mexicana, predominate=
d in
  the collections from rodents in eastern Panama. Of 1435 Phlebotomids diss=
ected,
  only one, an adult of Lutzomiya panamensis, was infected with Leishmania.=
 The
  results indicate that sentinel hamsters may be useful for detecting foci =
of L.
  mexicana but not L. braziliensis, as vectors of the latter species show l=
ittle
  interest in rodents. Sentinel dogs were fairly attractive to Lutzomyia
  sanguinaria but not to other vector species.

AB: A total of 269 virus strains was obtained from male and female Phleboto=
mids
  collected at human bait, in light-traps and while resting at two localiti=
es in
  Panama from 1969 to 1971. These isolates represented nine different virus=
 types
  (Changuinola, VSV-Indiana (vesicular stomatitis virus-Indiana), Punta Tor=
o-CoAr
  3319, Chagres, VP-175A, VP-437R, VP-161A, VP-488A, and VP-118D) as well a=
s
  several unidentified agents. The last five virus types are new. Changuino=
la
  complex viruses and Punta Toro-CoAr 3319 complex viruses were the most
  frequently encountered and represented 52% and 19% of the isolates,
  respectively. From man-biting Phlebotomids processed by species, the high=
est
  isolation rates were obtained from Lutzomyia trapidoi (Fairchild & Hertig=
).
  Analysis of the seasonal isolation of virus indicated that activity of
  Changuinola, Chagres, VP-175 and VP-437R was continuous and that of VSV-I=
ndiana
  [cf. RAE/B 55, 747] and Punta Toro-CoAr 3319 was intermittent. Seventeen
  isolates, representing six different virus types, were obtained from male
  Phlebotomids. Isolation rates by sex for three of the virus types were si=
milar
  in collections yielding comparable numbers of males and females. The freq=
uency
  of virus isolations from males suggests that transovarial transmission of
  several of these agents occurs in nature [cf. 26, p.241].Neutralisation t=
ests
  on sera from inhabitants of seven rural Panamanian communities demonstrat=
ed a
  significant amount of human infection with VSV-Indiana, Punta Toro and VP=
-437R.
  Caged sentinel animals, exposed at one of the collection sites, became in=
fected
  with VSV-Indiana, Chagres, VP-175A and VP-437R. The study demonstrated th=
e
  superiority of the Vero-cell culture system over newborn mice for primary
  isolation of virus isolates from Phlebotomids. By using infected Vero cel=
ls as
  complement-fixing antigen for typing isolates, the necessity of blind pas=
sing
  many viruses in order to establish mouse pathogenicity was eliminated.

AB: Following the widespread epizootic and epidemic of Venezuelan equine
  encephalitis in Mexico in 1971 [RAE/B 62, 104], isolated outbreaks occurr=
ed in
  the western States, including Guerrero, early in 1972, and a more intensi=
ve one
  began in June in Morelos and three contiguous central states. The conditi=
ons in
  which the disease had developed in Morelos were studied in July. Serologi=
cal
  studies on man, equines, bovines, pigs and dogs involved in the outbreak =
showed
  that there had been no previous contact with the virus. Antibodies were n=
ot
  found at initial examinations but were present at high titres at subseque=
nt
  ones. Morbidity both in man and equines and mortality in equines were
  consequently high. The virus was isolated from the blood and pharyngeal
  exudates of sick people and equines. It was isolated from 92% of the huma=
n and
  in 71.4% of the equine specimens studied, and its presence was also
  demonstrated in bovines, pigs and dogs; it was also isolated six times fr=
om
  sentinel mice. Some of the dogs showed transitory signs of neurological
  disorders. Mosquitos of the genera Psorophora, Culex, Aedes, Limatus and
  Anopheles were caught and processed for virus isolation. The virus was is=
olated
  from Psorophora confinnis (Lynch Arrib.), Culex coronator D. & K., C. p.
  fatigans Wied. (C. quinquefasciatus, auct.) and C. nigripalpus Theo. Viru=
s was
  active at all altitudes. There is seasonal movement of people and equines
  between Morelos and the State of Guerrero where the virus was active befo=
re the

AB: Serum samples were collected from a sample of domestic mammals and fowl
  residing in four study villages before the start of the 1970 Japanese
  encephalitis epidemic and three times during the epidemic year. Antibody-=
free
  pigs, placed in each village as sentinels, were bled every month from Apr=
il
  1970 until June 1971. Tree sparrows and bats were also trapped and bled i=
n the
  villages. Attempts to isolate the virus from domestic and wild animal spe=
cimens
  were unsuccessful. Census findings revealed that the turnover rate in one=
 year
  for pigs was much higher than for other domestic mammals. Virus transmiss=
ion to
  sentinel pigs was detected in each of the 14 consecutive months, except f=
or two
  months of the cool-dry season; transmission rapidly increased with the st=
art of
  the seasonal rains. The prevalence of HI antibody was high in dogs, cattl=
e and
  indigenous pigs, but, except for a small group of horses, the geometric m=
ean
  titre was much higher in pigs than in other mammals. Antibody to Tembusu =
virus,
  rather than to Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), was prevalent in high t=
itre
  in domestic fowl. Paired serum samples collected from indigenous pigs, ca=
ttle
  and dogs confirmed that primary JEV infections occurred during the human
  epidemic in these species; animals with prior JEV antibodies were not inf=
ected.
  Only a small percentage of tree sparrow and bat serum samples neutralized=
 JEV.
  One pig infected with JEV under laboratory conditions developed a viraemi=
a of
  high titre and long duration. Buffalo and cattle on the other hand, faile=
d to
  develop detectable viraemia and had a poor HI antibody response following
  exposure to JEV-infected Culex tritaeniorhynchus and repeated inoculation=
s of
  JEV. One of three dogs developed low level viraemia after being bitten by=
 JEV
  -infected mosquitoes. The serological responses of these experimentally
  infected animals mimicked the serological patterns observed in domestic a=
nimals
  in the field. All of these results together suggest that pigs are importa=
nt in
  the epidemiology of JEV in the Chiangmai Valley; the role of other domest=
ic
  mammals is less certain. A pig-mosquito-man transmission sequence may be
  sufficient to account for human infections that occur throughout the year=

AB: Pigs are susceptible to asymptomatic infection with Japanese encephalit=
is
  virus and are effective amplifiers in the natural cycle [cf. RAE/B 58, 16=
65].
  Immunisation should modify this cycle. An account is given of a study in =
which
  serial isolations of virus and tests for haemagglutination-inhibiting ant=
ibody
  to it in pigs were made in non-immunised animals and in others immunised =
before
  the onset of the epidemic season, and associated mosquitos were examined =
for
  virus. Viraemia and serological evidence of infection were seen in all te=
n pigs
  that were not immunised. In the immunised group, 6 of 11 pigs did not sho=
w
  viraemia; in the other five, it was of shorter duration than that seen in=
 the
  non-immunised animals. Japanese encephalitis virus was recovered from 38 =
of 486
  pools of mosquitos (comprising 97 000 individuals of the complex of Culex
  tritaeniorhynchus Giles and C. vishnui Theo.) trapped at five sites near =
the
  pig pens. Most of these recoveries were made in July and August. The rate=
 of
  virus isolation from mosquitos caught in the pen containing immunised pig=
s was
  higher than that from mosquitos caught in the pen containing susceptible
  animals. Sentinel rabbits kept in the two pens showed no differences; all
  developed antibodies to the virus and some developed viraemia. Neverthele=
ss,
  immunisation clearly reduced the extent of viraemia, virus titre and the
  duration of viraemia in pigs exposed to natural infection.

AB: The epidemiology of western equine encephalitis in Culex tarsalis Coq.,
  house sparrows (Passer domesticus) and man was studied in Hale County, Te=
xas in
  1965-69 [cf. RAE/B 60, 300]. In 1965 and 1966 when 11 and 12 cases were
  observed in man, the percentages of nestling sparrows found infected in w=
eeks
  27-36 of each year were much higher (26.9 and 28.3%) than in the years 19=
67-69
  when no human cases occurred (4.8-8.5%). However, in 1965-66, the infecti=
on
  rates of C. tarsalis in weeks 27-36 (39.2%) and the antibody rates in Oct=
ober
  -November in sparrows (54.5-56.4%) and sentinel fowls (85-85.7%) were onl=
y
  slightly higher than in the non-epidemic years of 1967-69 (when they were=
 28.7
  -30.8%, 35.6-44.5% and 42.9-70.1%, respectively). The virus was also foun=
d in
  sparrows a little earlier in the year in the two epidemic years than in t=
he 3
  non-epidemic years. The house sparrow forms over two-thirds of the bird
  population in the county, and it is considered that this species may be t=
he
  major amplifying host of western equine encephalitis virus.

AB: A serological survey for antibodies to group A and group B arboviruses,
  Pseudomonas pseudomallei, and Rickettsia tsutsugamushi was conducted in
  Thailand. Serum samples were collected from 232 sentry dogs and 222 human=
 dog
  handlers at the time of their arrival in that country and quarterly there=
after
  for 1 year. Tests with the four antigens were negative for dogs and handl=
ers on
  arrival. Both dogs and handlers developed haemagglutination-inhibiting
  antibodies to group A arboviruses at the rate of 3% annually. Rates of ch=
ange
  of serotest results to positive for group B arbovirus antibody were 41% f=
or
  dogs and 34% for human handlers. Neither human handlers nor dogs develope=
d
  detectable antibodies against P. pseudomallei or R. tsutsugamushi. The hi=
ghest
  incidence of group B arbovirus antibody occurred during September to Dece=
mber.
  Dogs developed detectable antibody in 55% of the collection periods, and =
may
  therefore be of value as sentinel animals. A survey at Da Nang Air Base, =
South
  Vietnam, consisting of single samples from each of 50 sentry dogs, gave
  negative results, except that most had antibodies to group B arboviruses.
