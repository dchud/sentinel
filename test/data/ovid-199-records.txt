AB  - The outbreak of avian influenza A due to an H7N7 virus in Dutch poultry farms turned out to have public-health effects for those who were involved in the management of the epidemic and who were thus extensively exposed to contaminated excreta and dust. An outbreak-management team (OMT) of experts in virology, infectious diseases and public health advised the Dutch government with respect to the potential health effects on humans. Strict hygiene measures were advised. Moreover, vaccination against human influenza was advised to prevent emergence of a new pandemic virus in humans. Since the human influenza virus H3N2 circulated at the same time, a double infection and emergence of a new human virus was the main fear on which prevention was focused. Conjunctivitis was observed in about 10% of the people involved. The conjunctivitis was sometimes accompanied by mild flu-like symptoms and incidental transmission between humans occurred as well. Because of the unexpected hig!
h !
incidence of symptomatic infections, proven to be caused by the H7N7 strain, oseltamivir was advised as an additional control measure, both for the treatment of symptoms and prophylactically for those with prolonged occupational exposure. After the unfortunate death of a veterinarian due to pneumonia caused by the avian virus, the preventive policy was further extended to people with short and incidental exposure to infected flocks. It is concluded that the policy was adequate, in spite of the unforeseen victim.

AB  - The authors describe an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis among students working with calves as part of their veterinary science technology program. After an off-campus provider identified an index case, school authorities requested cryptosporidium (crypto) as part of the stool ova and parasite examination of all students presenting to the college health center with significant gastroenteritis. Thirteen students submitted stool specimens that were examined for crypto; 7 were positive, and all were from veterinary science students. One of the calves used in the program also tested positive for crypto. All of the students were immunocompetent and recovered uneventfully. The outbreak was contained by strictly enforcing infectious-disease precautions in the calf barn. The authors recommend considering crypto as a cause of gastroenteritis, especially among farm-animal workers, and urge strict infectious disease precautions for those who attend to livestock.

AB  - Comamonas species are environmental gram-negative rods that grow forming pink-pigmented colonies. Despite their common occurrence in nature, they rarely cause human infection. We present a case of Comamonas bacteremia that we think may have been related to tropical fish exposure. The patient was treated successfully with levofloxacin. [References: 10]

AB  - During the past couple of decades, numerous surveys for the occurrence and distribution of food-borne trematodes in Vietnam have been carried out. However, the majority of the data obtained have not been published in international journals, and therefore, the seriousness of these trematode parasitic zoonoses in the country has not been fully appreciated. To correct this, over 40 Vietnamese language reports and local publications were translated and organized as a status review for an international audience. The results show that such serious trematode zoonoses as clonorchiasis, opisthorchiasis, paragonimiasis and fascioliasis are common in many regions of Vietnam, and, in the case of fascioliasis and paragonimiasis, are increasing. Data on the species of intermediate hosts involved in the transmission of these zoonoses, and the effect of host sex and age on infection frequencies are presented, along with findings on food preference/behavior investigations. Finally, the!

uthors present recommendations for further research to provide a more comprehensive picture of the status of these zoonoses, and to obtain the risk assessment information needed to design prevention and control programs. [References: 90]

AB  - Zoonotic transfer of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) from chimpanzees and sooty mangabeys to humans has been documented on at least seven occasions. Several recently identified SIV isolates have also been shown to replicate efficiently in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in vitro, indicative of the potential for additional cross-species transmission via T cell infection. Although SIV predominantly uses the macrophage-tropic HIV chemokine coreceptor CCR5, little is known about the ability of SIV to infect human macrophages. In this study, 16 SIV isolates belonging to five different primate lentivirus lineages were tested for their ability to infect human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). Twelve of the viruses were capable of infecting MDMs, and 11 of these were also able to replicate in human PBMCs. The replication capacity of the isolates differed within and between the various families and was dependent on particular donor macrophages. Our resul!
 ts!
 suggest that most simian lentiviruses characterized to date not only have the ability to infect primary human T lymphocytes but also replicate efficiently in macrophages, thereby increasing the potential for cross-species transmission into the human population. Comparative studies using these isolates may facilitate the identification of characteristics that contribute to virus infectivity and pathogenicity.

AB  - Swine hepatitis E Virus (swine HEV), a ubiquitous agent recently discovered in pigs, is antigenically and genetically closely related to the human HEV. Swine HEV infection in pigs generally occurs at about 2-3 months of age, and about 80%-100% of the pigs in commercial farms in the USA were infected. Swine HEV infections have now been recognized in pigs in many other countries of the world. Interspecies transmission has been documented, as swine HEV infects non-human primates and some strains of human HEV infect pigs. Recent seroepidemiological studies showed that swine veterinarians and other pig handlers are at higher risk of HEV infection compared to normal blood donors. In addition, novel strains of human HEV recovered from hepatitis patients in the USA, Japan and Taiwan are genetically more closely related to strains of swine HEV from respective countries than to other strains of human HEV. The ubiquitous nature of the virus in pigs and the demonstrated ability of!
  c!
ross-species infection raise a potential concern for swine HEV infection in xenotransplantation with pig organs. This chapter discusses the recent advances in HEV research with emphases on potential zoonosis and xenozoonosis. [References: 86]

AB  - Porcine organs, cells and tissues provide a viable source of transplants in humans, though there is some concern of public health risk from adaptation of swine infectious agents in humans. Limited information is available on the public health risk of many exogenous swine viruses, and reliable and rapid diagnostic tests are available for only a few of these. The ability of several porcine viruses to cause transplacental fetal infection (parvoviruses, circoviruses, and arteriviruses), emergence or recognition of several new porcine viruses during the last two decades (porcine circovirus, arterivirus, paramyxoviruses, herpesviruses, and porcine respiratory coronavirus) and the immunosuppressed state of the transplant recipients increases the xenozoonoses risk of humans to porcine viruses through transplantation. Much of this risk can be eliminated with vigilance and sustained monitoring along with a better understanding of pathogenesis and development of better diagnostic!

ests. In this review we present information on selected exogenous viruses, highlighting their characteristics, pathogenesis of viral infections in swine, methods for their detection, and the potential xenozoonoses risk they present. Emphasis has been given in this review to swine influenza virus, paramyxovirus (Nipah virus, Menagle virus, LaPiedad paramyxovirus, porcine paramyxovirus), arterivirus (porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus) and circovirus as either they represent new swine viruses or present the greatest risk. We have also presented information on porcine parvovirus, Japanese encephalitis virus, encephalomyocarditis virus, herpesviruses (pseudorabies virus, porcine lymphotropic herpesvirus, porcine cytomegalovirus), coronaviruses (TGEV, PRCV, HEV, PEDV) and adenovirus. The potential of swine viruses to infect humans needs to be assessed in vitro and in vivo and rapid and more reliable diagnostic methods need to be developed to assure safe supply of!

AB  - Significant progress in making animal-to-human transplantation a viable adjunct to human organ donation will require a greater understanding of the intricacies of immunologic rejection. Recent success in generating cloned knockout piglets increases the possibility that xenotransplantation may find its way into the clinics. Nonhuman primates' organs have been used for human transplants in the past and there is reason to believe that if ethical considerations and inherent problems with supply were overcome, their close genetic proximity to humans would lessen complications of rejection. Unfortunately, nonhuman primates harbor several pathogens known to be infectious in humans and the potential of other viral infections has precluded further use of monkeys in this setting. Baboons are generally considered the nonhuman primate species of choice yet this species carries several retroviruses considered a threat to humans in transplantation.

AB  - Herpesviruses are found throughout the animal kingdom. Members of this family share properties including a highly orchestrated system of transcription, destruction of the host cell by active viral replication and an ability to persist in the host in a latent form. Human herpesviruses have all been implicated in causing substantial disease after allotransplantation. Often transmission of these viruses has been through the donor organ or blood products. Analogous species of herpesviruses exist in nonhuman primates. Accordingly, concern regarding the risk of their transmission and disease exists with xenotransplant procedures. This chapter reviews herpesviruses of nonhuman primates and their potential implication for causing disease after xenotransplantation. [References: 86]

AB  - Animals have always been a major source of human infectious disease. Some infections like rabies are recognized as primary zoonoses caused in each case by direct animal-to-human transmission, whereas others like measles become independently sustained within the human population so that the causative virus has diverged from its morbillivirus progenitor in ruminants. Recent examples of direct zoonoses are variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease arising from bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and the H5N1 avian influenza outbreak in Hong Kong. Recent epidemic diseases of animal origin are the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic, and the acquired immune deficiency syndrome pandemic caused by human immunodeficiency virus. Some retroviruses move into and out of the chromosomal DNA of the host germline, so that they may oscillate between being an avirulent inherited Mendelian trait in one species and an infectious pathogen in another. Cross-species viral and other infections are reviewed h!

AB  - A mass outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the Amoy Gardens housing complex in Hong Kong at the end of March, 2003, affected more than 300 residents in less than a month, and has epidemiologists all over the world puzzled about the mode of transmission of this new disease, which until then was thought to be transmitted solely by respiratory droplets. The source of the outbreak was later traced to an individual with SARS who spent two nights at Amoy Gardens. Official explanations failed to account for the large number of residents infected over a wide area within a short time. A powerful environmental mechanism that efficiently amplified and distributed the causal agent must have been at work to cause this outbreak. One such mechanism could be an animal vector, most probably roof rats, that was infected by the index patient and subsequently spread the disease to more than 150 households.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging disease, which was first recognized in Guangdong Province, China, in November 2002. In the meantime, SARS has been recognized in patients on all five continents. A novel coronavirus, which is not related to the hitherto known coronaviruses, has been proven to be associated with the disease. Our genomic analyses strongly suggest that the new SARS-coronavirus did not emerge through mutation or recombination and that it has probably been transmitted from a so far not identified animal species to humans. Therefore, it is most likely that SARS virus is a zoonotic agent. A broad body of knowledge originating from research in veterinary medicine indicates that development of vaccines against the SARS-coronavirus may be problematic. The potential danger of such vaccines should not be neglected during the process of vaccine development. [References: 23]

AB  - The distribution of human risk for West Nile virus was determined by spatial analysis of the initial case distribution for the New York City area in 1999 using remote sensing and geographic information system technologies. Cluster analysis revealed the presence of a statistically significant grouping of cases, which also indicates the area of probable virus introduction. Within the cluster, habitat suitability for potentially infective adult mosquitoes was measured by the amount of vegetation cover using satellite imagery. Logistic regression analysis revealed satellite-derived vegetation abundance to be significantly and positively associated with the presence of human cases. The logistic model was used to estimate the spatial distribution of human risk for West Nile virus throughout New York City. Accuracy of the resulting risk map was cross-validated using virus-positive mosquito sample sites. These new epidemiological methods aid in rapid entry point identification!

AB  - As the British bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) epidemic declines towards extinction, the European epidemic continues to grow. The introduction of active surveillance in Europe and elsewhere makes direct comparison with past events in Britain difficult. BSE is increasingly recognized to be a global problem. While the epidemics in other countries may never reach the scale experienced in Britain, failure to learn from the British experience will prolong consumer concerns and the consequences for international trade for many years. There are still more clinical cases in Britain per year than in any other country. Nevertheless, the risk of exposure of British cattle may for some time have been greatest from imported products. The tightening of British feed controls in 1996 has had a significant effect, but feed controls were only tightened in Europe in 2000 and 2001. The covert nature of exposure means that risks are not recognized until long after the critical event!
  o!
f exposure has occurred. Recent consideration by the European Commission's Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) of the risks of importing BSE suggests that dispersal of infectivity from European countries was wide-spread even before the disease was first recognized in Britain in 1986.

AB  - AIM: This is a review of the natural Campylobacter colonization and transmission among ruminant livestock in the dairy farm environment. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using cultural detection methods and enumeration techniques the distribution of Campylobacter in ruminant animals at birth, on the farm, at slaughter and in the farm environment have been examined. Colonization and shedding rates are higher among young animals while patterns of shedding in adult animals may be seasonal. Stored and land-dispersed slurries provide a reservoir for scavenging birds and flies and a source for runoff. CONCLUSIONS: The dairy farm plays a significant role in the dissemination of Campylobacter subtypes that can cause disease in the human community. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: An understanding of the role of the dairy farm in the environmental cycle of Campylobacter is required in order to devise intervention strategies.

AB  - Pandemic influenza is a zoonosis. Studies on influenza ecology conducted in Hong Kong since the 1970s in which Hong Kong essentially functioned as an influenza sentinel post indicated that it might be possible, for the first time, to have influenza preparedness at the baseline avian level. This appreciation of influenza ecology facilitated recognition of the H5N1 'bird flu' incident in Hong Kong in 1997 in what was considered to be an incipient pandemic situation, the chicken being the source of virus for humans and, if so, was the first instance where a pandemic may have been averted. The 2001 and 2002 H5N1 incidents demonstrated that it was possible to have an even higher order of baseline preparedness with the recognition in chicken of a range of genotypes of H5N1-like viruses before they had the opportunity to infect humans. Investigations of these incidents revealed a complex ecology involving variously precursor avian H5N1 virus in geese and ducks, and H9N2 and H!
 6N!
1 viruses in quail, the quail possibly functioning as an avian 'mixing vessel' for key genetic reassortment events for onward transmission of H5N1 viruses highly pathogenic for chicken and humans. These findings highlight the importance of systematic virus surveillance of domestic poultry in recognizing changes in virus occurrence, host range and pathogenicity as signals at the avian level that could presage a pandemic. For example, there is now an increasing prevalence of avian influenza viruses in terrestrial (in contrast to aquatic) poultry. Prior to 1997, no particular virus subtype other than H4N6 would have been considered a candidate for pandemicity and this was based, in the absence of any other data, on its high frequency of occurrence in ducks in southern China. Now,with the isolation of H5N1 and H9N2 viruses from humans supported by genetic, molecular and biological studies on these and other avian isolates, there is credible evidence for the candidacy, in order, !
 of!
 H5N1, H9N2 and H6N1 viruses.These viruses have been made available for the production of diagnostic reagents and exploratory vaccines. The 1997 incident upheld the hypothesis that southern China is an epicentre for the emergence of pandemic influenza viruses. However, the intensification of the poultry (chicken) industry worldwide coupled with the spread of viruses such as the Eurasian lineage of H9N2 suggest that the genesis of a pandemic could take place elsewhere in the world. This re-emphasizes the importance of systematic virus surveillance of poultry globally for international public health and for economic and food concerns. Faced with an incipient pandemic in 1997, Hong Kong brought in international experts to join the investigative effort. Good teamwork at all levels is essential in dealing with the many facets. The threat of a pandemic should not be minimized, nor should governments be lulled into a sense of false security. The media is a powerful channel and has !
 th!
e responsibility and the avenues to convey and influence public perception of events. Close liaison between the media and those on the operational side ensures effective, accurate and timely dissemination of information. This will enhance public confidence in the investigative process and in steps taken for its safety and health.

AB  - Since 1994, a number of novel viruses have been described from bats in Australia and Malaysia, particularly from fruit bats belonging to the genus Pteropus (flying foxes), and it is probable that related viruses will be found in other countries across the geographical range of other members of the genus. These viruses include Hendra and Nipah viruses, members of a new genus, Henipaviruses, within the family Paramyxoviridae; Menangle and Tioman viruses, new members of the Rubulavirus genus within the Paramyxoviridae; and Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV), a member of the Lyssavirus genus in the family Rhabdoviridae. All but Tioman virus are known to be associated with human and/or livestock diseases. The isolation, disease associations and biological properties of the viruses are described, and are used as the basis for developing management strategies for disease prevention or control. These strategies are directed largely at disease minimization through good farm manag!
 em!
ent practices, reducing the potential for exposure to flying foxes, and better disease recognition and diagnosis, and for ABLV specifically, the use of rabies vaccine for pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis. Finally, an intriguing and long-term strategy is that of wildlife immunization through plant-derived vaccination. [References: 91]

AB  - West Nile virus was first recorded in the New World during August 1999 in New York City. Aetiology of the disease in the Old World indicated birds as the likely introductory and amplifying hosts with ornithophilous mosquitoes, e.g. Culex pipiens, as the principal vectors. Speculation regarding likely agents for movement of the virus in its new environment focused on migratory birds, but evidence to date is equivocal. While spread of the disease has been fairly rapid, at a rate of roughly 70 km a month, it has not shown the kind of long-distance, leap frog movements one might expect if transient birds were the principal introductory hosts. Furthermore, movement of the disease has not been focused southward, but shows a radiating pattern with detection sites located in all directions from New York where terrestrial habitat was available. In addition, tests among potential New World, avian hosts have revealed prolonged viraemia (up to 5 days) only in the relatively non-mi!
 gr!
atory House Sparrow (Passer domesticus). Dispersal movements by this species could account for the observed pattern of West Nile virus spread in the Western Hemisphere to date. Regardless of whether avian migration, dispersal, or some other agent is responsible, West Nile virus should reach the New World tropics in another 1-2 years, at which time a vast number of new potential introductory and amplifying avian hosts would be exposed to the disease and mosquito vectors would be available throughout most of the year, likely causing serious, long-term threats to human health and vulnerable avian populations in the region.

AB  - The aims of this study are to report evidence of the first laboratory-acquired infection of Vibrio parahaemolyticus associated with handling experimentally infected abalones and to describe the virulence of the two bacterial strains tested in these animals. Two strains of V. parahaemolyticus, one from the stool of a patient with acute gastroenteritis (strain 880713) and the other from the hemolymph of a diseased small abalone Haliotis diversicolor supertexta (strain 880915), were identified and characterized. Both strains were lethal to small abalone, with similar LD(50) values (8.36-8.41 x 10(4) colony-forming units/g abalone). Laboratory-acquired infection resulted in one individual experiencing two episodes of acute gastroenteritis due to handling virulence tests during a 1-week interval. Our present results suggest that a V. parahaemolyticus strain isolated from the stool of a patient with gastroenteritis was infectious for small abalone, a major species of edible !
 mo!
llusk abalone cultured in Taiwan, while a similar strain isolated from hemolymph of a diseased small abalone was infectious for humans. This is the first report of V. parahaemolyticus virulent to small abalone as a zoonotic pathogen.

AB  - The intricate causal relationships between disease in man and disease in animals first began to be elucidated in the mid-19th century. Although the connections between animal and human disease are now generally understood, individuals as well as societies remain slow to act on this knowledge. This paper examines the gradual recognition of these disease connections and explores the parallel theme of man's reluctance to appreciate the implications of these connections. It identifies factors that have inhibited the realization of the links between disease in man and animals, and discusses several milestones in the scientific elucidation of these links. Beginning with emerging concerns over the relationship between bovine and human tuberculosis in the 1860s, it follows the discovery of insect vectors, animal reservoirs, and the links between animals, influenza, and man. Despite warnings of the potential significance for human disease of patterns of changes in the relations!

p with animals and the natural world, scientists have continued to treat human and animal health as largely independent disciplines, while historians too have neglected this important aspect of human disease.

AB  - An epidemic-geographic rabies study was carried out in which 72 animal and human brain samples were analyzed for Lyssaviruses by a direct immunofluorescent technique (DIFT) and a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Fifty-two samples were also tested by a mouse inoculation test. Lyssavirus RNA was detected in 60 of 72 samples. Five DIFT-negative bat samples tested by a nested PCR assay showed evidence of the presence of rabies virus RNA. Sequencing of amplified rabies virus nucleoprotein encoding segments of a selection of the samples resulted in the formation of clusters, corresponding to samples originating from cattle and equines from the same hydrographic basin. Genomically related Lyssavirus strains of bat origin were found in each cluster, most likely because of the role of the bat in the epidemiology of the virus. All samples studied were of genotype 1. With exception of the human sample, all were distinct from the reference sample.

AB  - The presence of anti-Toxoplasma gondii IgG antibodies in a high titer of 1:8,000 was found in 2 out of 9 examined rabbits (22.2%), kept on a farm where cases of human toxoplasmosis were noted. A virulent Toxoplasma gondii strain was isolated in mice from the brain of a seropositive rabbit that showed clinical signs of disease: apathy, weight loss, skin lesions. The presence of T. gondii DNA in the peritoneal exudate of mice inoculated with the brain suspension of the dissected rabbit was confirmed by the positive results of PCR test. No toxoplasmas were found in mice inoculated with suspensions of other organs of the examined rabbit (liver, spleen, kidneys, lungs, heart, skeletal muscles). In the sections of the rabbit's brain the typical cysts of Toxoplasma gondii were found, filled with bradyzoites. On the basis of strain isolation and microscopic findings, toxoplasmosis of the central nervous system was diagnosed in the rabbit. The results of this study suggest that!

AB  - Zoonosis has been suggested for hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection, but so far is based only on indirect evidence. We experienced a series of cases of HEV infection among people who had eaten uncooked deer meat 6-7 weeks before. On testing, a left over portion of the deer meat, kept frozen to eat in the future, was positive for HEV RNA, whose nucleotide sequence was identical to those from the patients. Patients' family members who ate none or very little of the deer meat remained uninfected. These findings provide direct evidence for HEV infection to be a zoonosis.

AB  - To determine whether the agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE) (Anaplasma phagocytophilum) may be maintained in a parallel enzootic cycle between cottontail rabbits and their ticks, we sampled these hosts from a zoonotic site during five transmission seasons. Evidence of infection was sought by microscopy and polymerase chain reaction from rabbit blood or splenic tissue, and from ticks collected from rabbits or from vegetation. Approximately 27% of all rabbits sampled contained evidence of active infection, and 66% were seropositive. The vectorial capacity of Ixodes dentatus was demonstrated by xenodiagnosis studies; in addition, 2% of host-seeking nymphs were infected. Haemaphysalis leporispalustris was not a competent vector. Because of their propensity to densely inhabit peridomestic sites, and because I. dentatus may be transported by birds, a parallel cycle of transmission in cottontail rabbits would facilitate introduction and perpetuation of the agent o!

AB  - A five-year project to prevent human deaths from rabies in Phetchabun Province, Thailand involved increasing accessibility of post-exposure treatment with the Thai Red Cross intradermal (2-2-2-0-1-1) regimen for humans exposed to potentially and confirmed rabid animals; intensifying documentation of post-exposure treatment; increasing educational awareness through advocacy in provincial schools, television programmes, and newspapers; reducing canine rabies by monitoring the dog population and implementing vaccination and sterilization programmes; increasing the cooperation between the Ministries of Public Health, Agriculture, and Education on a provincial level; and assessing the impact of the programme through intensified follow-up of patients exposed to suspected and laboratory-confirmed rabid animals. Between 1996 and 2001, 10350 patients received post-exposure treatment; 7227 of these received the Thai Red Cross intradermal regimen. Fewer than 3% of exposed patient!
 s !
received rabies immunoglobulin. Seventy-three percent of all patients presented with WHO category III exposures. In a retrospective study, 188 patients exposed to laboratory-confirmed rabid animals were followed to determine their health status. Of these patients, 20 received the intramuscular Essen regimen and 168 the Thai Red Cross intradermal regimen (148 received 0.1 ml purified chick embryo cell rabies vaccine, 10 received 0.1 ml purified vero cell rabies vaccine, and 10 received 0.2 ml purified duck embryo cell rabies vaccine). All patients were alive one year after exposure. Two human deaths occurred in the first two years of the programme - neither patient had received vaccine or rabies immunoglobulin after exposure. No deaths occurred during the last three years of the programme, which indicated that the programme was successful.

AB  - Meat is an important source of protein and a valuable commodity in resource-poor communities. In many developing countries, lack of appropriate slaughtering facilities and unsatisfactory slaughtering techniques are causing unnecessary losses of meat as well as invaluable by-products from animal carcasses. Slaughtering places are frequently contaminated and may not be protected against dogs, rodents and insects. Meat products coming from such conditions are often deteriorated due to bacterial infection or contaminated, which may cause food poisoning or diseases in consumers. In many developing countries, regulations concerning meat inspection and/or control are inadequate or non-existent allowing consumers to be exposed to pathogens including zoonotic parasites. In Nepal, buffaloes contribute about 64% of the meat consumed, followed by goat meat (20%), pork (7%), poultry (6%) and mutton (2%). Goat and poultry meat is acceptable to all castes of people while buffalo meat!
  i!
s consumed mainly by the Newar ethnic group. Previously, pork was consumed only by people belonging to low castes, however, in recent years, the consumption of pork has increased in higher castes as the caste system has become more relaxed. Until recently, there were no official meat inspection regulations in the country, however, in 1999, the national government legislated an as-yet-to-be implemented Animal Slaughtering and Meat Inspection Act which mandates slaughterhouse construction and meat inspection and control. Due to the lack of implementation of the Meat Inspection Act and resultant absence of meat inspection, meat from sick or parasite-infected animals is serving as a source of infection to humans as well as other animals. In addition, meat quality is adversely affected by careless handling conditions in the slaughtering places as well as in the meat markets or shops. For improvement in animal slaughtering and meat inspection in both rural and urban areas of Nepal!
 , !
several strategies are to be recommended. Sustainable capacity building should be introduced including training of veterinarians, meat inspectors and butchers as well as building of slaughter facilities. Government policies on slaughter procedures including ante-mortem examination, meat inspection and stamping of meat should be implemented. Programmes should be instituted with strong focus on prevention and control of meat-borne diseases to reduce infection risk of consumers and meat handlers and to avoid contamination of the environment. Lastly, emphasis should be put on improving the animal husbandry system in Nepal. These same actions can be undertaken in other developing countries to assist with improving meat inspection and control, thus helping with prevention and control of cysticercosis as well as other important meat-borne diseases.

AB  - Rickettsialpox, a spotted fever rickettsiosis, was first identified in New York City (NYC) in 1946. During the next five years, approximately 540 additional cases were identified in NYC. However, during the subsequent five decades, rickettsialpox received relatively little attention from clinicians and public health professionals, and reporting of the disease diminished markedly. During February 2001 through August 2002, 34 cases of rickettsialpox in NYC were confirmed at CDC from cutaneous biopsy specimens tested by using immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, PCR analysis, and isolation of Rickettsia akari in cell culture, as well as an indirect immunofluorescence assay of serum specimens. Samples were collected from patients with febrile illnesses accompanied by an eschar, a papulovesicular rash, or both. Patients originated predominantly from two boroughs (Manhattan and the Bronx). Only 8 (24%) of the cases were identified prior to the reports of bioterrorism-associat!
 ed!
 anthrax in the United States during October 2001, and lesions of several patients evaluated during and subsequent to this episode were suspected initially to be cutaneous anthrax. IHC staining of biopsy specimens of eschars and papular lesions were positive for spotted fever group rickettsiae for 32 patients. Of the eleven patients for whom paired serum samples were obtained, all demonstrated fourfold or greater increases in antibody titers reactive with R. akari. The 17-kDa protein gene sequence of R. akari was amplified from eschars of five patients. Four isolates of R. akari were obtained from cutaneous lesions. Possible factors responsible for the increase in clinical samples evaluated for rickettsialpox during this interval include renewed clinical interest in the disease, improved diagnostic methods, epizootiological influences, and factors associated with the recent specter of bioterrorism.

AB  - Orf, or contagious ecthyma, is a rare viral dermatosis caused by a member of the genus Parapoxvirus. The typical lesion consists of solitary or multiple papules that progress through a series of stages, terminating in complete resolution. This zoonotic disease is most commonly transmitted to humans from infected sheep or goats. We report a case of human orf, likely contracted from exposure to deer carcasses.

AB  - This review aims to summarise some of the recent studies that have been undertaken on parasites of the genus Echinococcus and the diseases which they cause. Although the adult parasite, which inhabits the intestine of various carnivore species is not pathogenic, the larval or metacestode stages can be highly pathogenic, causing economic losses to livestock and various forms of echinococcosis in humans, some of which have a high fatality rate. There is growing evidence that there are at least 5 species of Echinococcus rather than the generally accepted 4 species. Within these species there are a number of genotypes or strains. This can have implications for surveillance and control. In some wealthy countries, cystic echinococcosis caused by Echinococcus granulosus has been successfully controlled or indeed eradicated. However, in most parts of the world it remains a serious threat to human health. In the former Soviet Union, the disease has rapidly increased in incidenc!
 e !
after the end of communist administration. Human alveolar echinococcosis, caused by Echinococcus multilocularis, is more sporadic. However, in some Chinese communities there is a disturbingly high human prevalence and in Europe there has been an increase in the detection rate of E. multilocularis in animals in the last 10 years. Echinococcosis can present diagnostic challenges, particularly in the definitive host in areas of low endemicity. Much of the recent work relating to the use of coproantigen and PCR to overcome these difficulties is summarized. New ideas for controlling the parasite are becoming available and these include both the use of vaccination and the application of mathematical models to determine the most cost effective means of control. Effective measures that are affordable are vital if the parasite is to be controlled in poor countries. [References: 78]

AB  - As medical knowledge continues to expand, the division between animal and human diseases continues to decrease. The popularity of small mammals in lieu of the increased numbers of immunocompromised individuals will require increasingly broader understandings of zoonotic disease. The vast amount of animal research in areas of human disease requires diligent study to stay abreast of emerging diagnostics and therapeutics. The core requirements of skin scrapings, fungal culture, and microscopy for the diagnosis of small mammal fungal disease, however, are unchanged. [References: 50]

AB  - Zoophlic dermatophytes are common cause of tinea infections in Europe, especially in Mediterranean area. The aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of zoophilic dermatophytes in Sarajevo area, during a five-year period (1998-2002). Samples (skin scrapings or nail fragments) were taken from 2,142 patients who presented with suspected dermatophytoses and cultured on Sabouraud agar. After three weeks of incubations 465 (21.7%) dermatophytes were identified based on macroscopic and microscopic morphology. Zoophilic dermatophytes were found in 421 (90.5%) patients. The most common zoophilic species was Microsporum canis (80.0%), whereas Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Trichophyton verrucosum were less frequently isolated, in 9.7% and 0.9%, respectively. Lesions of tinea capitis were the most prevalent clinical type of Microsporum canis infections (28.8%), followed by tinea corporis (27.4%), tinea faciei (14.8%), tinea pedum (10.2%), tinea unguium (7.8%), tinea man!
 uu!
m (7.5%) and tinea cruris (3.5%). The findings in our study indicate a constant increase in frequency of the zoophilic microsporiasis in recent years in Sarajevo area.

AB  - We conducted a survey on how much veterinary clinics staff, mostly veterinary technicians, know about zoonosis and how extensively they inform pet owners of ways to prevent zoonosis. The number of people who took part in the survey was 1,057. The ratio of people who said their knowledge on zoonosis is "neither sufficient nor insufficient" was 53.8%, which is larger than the ratio of people who replied "sufficient" or "insufficient." The percentage of those who said their way of giving information on zoonosis to pet owners is "neither sufficient nor insufficient" was 52.4%. The ratios of people who knew about Spirometra erinacei, Dipylidium canium or Giardia lamblia were 64.7%, 73.6% and 57.6%, respectively. The longer they worked, the more they knew about Cryptosporidium spp. (20.1%), Hymenolepis nana (31.8%), Echinococcus spp. (45.7%), Ancylostoma spp. (73.3%), Dirofilaria immitis (80.5%), Toxoplasma gondii (82.4%), and Toxocara canis (86.5%).

AB  - In 1876, Robert Koch established anthrax as the first disease linked to a microbial agent. But Koch's efforts had followed more than 150 years of scientific progress in characterizing anthrax as a specific human and veterinary disease. Focusing on France and the period between 1769 and 1780, this brief review examines noteworthy early events in the characterization of anthrax. It suggests that some "new" diseases like anthrax might be "discovered" not only by luck, brilliance, or new technologies, but by clinical/epidemiological "puzzle-fitting," which can assemble a cohesive picture of a seemingly specific disease entity. If such processes have operated over 2 or more centuries, studying them may yield clues about desirable interactions between epidemiology/public health and experimental science in the characterization of new diseases.

AB  - Toxocariasis in man is traditionally thought to be contracted through the ingestion of eggs from contaminated soil. The disease may manifest itself in different syndromes such as ocular larval migrans, visceral larval migrans and covert toxocariasis. This paper assesses the evidence for the soil contamination hypothesis and proposes that direct contact with dogs may provide a better explanation of the epidemiology of the disease. Hair was collected from 60 dogs from various places in Ireland and the UK and examined for the presence of Toxocara canis eggs. T. canis eggs were found in the hair of 25 per cent of the dogs; in total, 71 eggs were recovered, of which 4.2 per cent were embryonated and 23.9 per cent were embryonating. The maximum densities of the embryonating and embryonated eggs were 180 and 20 eggs per gram of hair, respectively, much higher than the densities reported for soil samples. It is suggested that dogs infected with T. canis may infect people by di!

AB  - In 1995-1999 the aggravation of the epidemiological situation in rabies took place in the Krasnodar Territory. In the region of Great Sochi this was due to the emergency situation (armed conflict) on the adjoining territory (in Abkhazia), which led to the migration of domestic animals, turning wild, to the Black Sea coast where the situation with this infection had earlier been favorable. In 1995-1997 on the territory of Great Sochi 4 persons died of rabies as a consequence of getting dog bites and then failing to apply for medical assistance. A threat for human health is also created by cutting down work on the extermination of stray dogs and cats, the insufficient provision of medical institutions with antirabic preparations. The efforts of the medical service of the Territory should be concentrated on the prophylactic measures for controlling rabies.

AB  - Information on recent epizootic activity on the territories with natural foci of plague, situated in the Chechen Republic and the Republic of Ingushetia, is presented. Opinion is advanced concerning an increase in the epidemiological potential of the Terek-Sunzha hill focus and the Caspian sand focus of plague, which under the conditions of complicated socio-political situation in the area does not exclude the possibility of epidemiological complications.

AB  - During the last two years the natural foci of plague in the North Caucasus were controlled with relatively low intensity. Nevertheless, every year rodents of different species and their fleas, both infected with Yersinia pestis, were detected in all 5 foci. According to the available data, no intensive, expanding epizootics were registered at the period under consideration. In the areas where stable manifestations of plague, irrespective of the density of the population of vector rodents, were observed for decades only a few infected rodents or local epizootics of plague were mainly registered.

AB  - The aggravation of the epidemiological situation in the North Caucasian region of Russia was shown to be possible in view of the unfavorable conditions in a number of dangerous zoonotic infections in this region. The positive effect of human activities, aimed mainly at obtaining economic advantages, on the natural environment was noted. Only in a number of cases these activities lead to a decrease in the epidemic potential of infections.

AB  - Zoonoses are diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans. More than 250 distinct zoonoses have been described in the literature. It is estimated that 56% of United States households contain at least one pet, and although considerable research has been performed regarding the more common household animals including dogs, cats, small birds, and rodents, surprisingly little is known about the zoonotic hazards of owning the more exotic pets. According to the 1997 USPHS/IDSA Report on the Prevention of Opportunistic Infections in Persons Infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus, the immunocompromised patient should avoid contact with feces-laden soil, litter boxes, reptiles, most pet birds, and any animal less than 6 months old . It has also been documented that because of their inquisitive nature, children are at even higher risk for infection from animals than adolescents or immunocompetent adults. In this article the authors have reviewed the available data!
  r!
egarding hazards associated with the hedgehog, flying squirrel, iguana, chinchilla, and cockatoo. With the growing popularity of such exotic pets, further observation and research is warranted. Physicians need to be aware of the possibility of zoonotic disease related to exotic pet ownership, and they should address this issue when obtaining a history and formulating a differential diagnosis of cutaneous lesions suggestive of such illnesses.

AB  - Tularemia is a rare but potentially fatal disease that develops in numerous wild and domestic animals, including lagomorphs, rodents, cats, and humans. The disease occurs throughout much of the United States and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute febrile illness, particularly when risk factors such as contact with wild mammals or tick exposure are present. Veterinarians may be at increased risk of acquiring tularemia from contact with infected animals, but standard precautions should greatly reduce this risk. Outbreaks of tularemia warrant investigation, especially given the possibility of the use of F tularensis as an agent of bioterrorism. [References: 70]

AB  - Despite intensive research and considerable effort to eradicate infectious diseases, modern medicine has failed to control many infectious diseases which have been thought to be easy to overcome with advances in medical science and technology. In fact, infectious diseases remain a dominant feature in public health considerations for the 21st century. Some infectious agents already known to be pathogenic have gained increasing importance in recent decades due to changes in disease patterns. Furthermore, many new, previously unknown infectious agents with a high pathogenic potential have been identified. Nearly all of these emergent disease episodes have involved zoonotic or species-jumping infectious agents. The complex interaction of factors like environmental and ecological changes, social factors, decline of health care, human demographics and behaviour influences the emergence of re-emergence of such diseases. Viruses, especially RNA viruses with their ability to ad!
 ap!
t quickly to changing environmental conditions, are among the most prominent examples of emerging pathogens. In this review, we present the important examples of zoonotic viruses and discuss the factors playing a key role in the emergence and resurgence of these diseases. Copyright 2003 S.

AB  - The role of Toxocara cati as a zoonosis is reviewed. It is suggested that, despite case histories of human infection in the literature, historical factors have led to T. cati being under-recognized as a zoonosis, particularly when compared with the prominence given to Toxocara canis in dogs. Differentiation of the two infections remains challenging even today. It is recommended that further work be conducted to facilitate differentiation so that the importance of T. cati as a zoonosis can be clearly defined. [References: 43]

AB  - The Nipah virus outbreak represented one of several bat-derived paramyxoviruses that has emerged during the last decade to cause severe human and animal disease. The pathogenesis of Nipah infection is associated with its ability to infect blood vessels and extravascular parenchyma in many organs, particularly in the central nervous system. The clinical manifestations of acute Nipah infection range from fever and mild headache to a severe acute encephalitic syndrome in which there is a high mortality. Much remains to be understood about this new disease, including its intriguing ability to cause relapsing encephalitis in some survivors. This review provides an overview of the Nipah outbreak, focussing on what is presently known about it as an infectious disease, including the clinical aspects, pathology and pathogenesis.

AB  - Transmission of Cryptosporidium sp. within the general public was studied. We were looking for a possible risk of infection associated with animal contacts. Investigation of the animal contacts of affected individuals led to the formulation of the hypothesis that animals are a source of cryptosporidiosis. The research was done in the Region of Ljubljana, an area with 587,000 inhabitants during a period of three years. Stool specimens of 338 persons with acute enteric diseases were positive for Cryptosporidium sp. Diagnosis was done with an immunofluorescence test and modified Ziel-Neelsen staining. Processing of statistical data was done with the medical software application EPI INFO 6. According to our questionnaire, direct contact with animals occurred in 49 of the 338 cases of cryptosporidiosis, and was more frequently registered in males (Odds ratio = 1.96). Subgenotyping analysis revealed the presence of two subgenotypes of Cryptosporidium parvum bovine (GPB and G!
 PC!
) in humans. These data indicate that genetic heterogeneity in C. parvum bovine genotype exists in a localized area and that farm animals can be a source of infection.

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate zoonosis and vector surveillance systems in major countries, conducted by quarantine, health and environment authorities, and compare the results with the current Japanese systems. METHODS: We elaborated a questionnaire for zoonosis and vector surveillance systems regarding target diseases, vectors, period and area of operation, type of surveillance (active and/or positive), and feedback mechanisms which was then mailed to ten countries having strong trade and tourism links with Japan. We visited some authorities for further discussions. RESULTS: Eight countries which responded answered that all were conducting zoonosis and vector surveillance. Target diseases included those designated by the International Health Regulations and others with a higher priority for control and prevention in the individual countries. The type of surveillance was classified as: regular monitoring of the vector population, active detection of pathogens in vectors duri!
 ng!
 a specific time period of a year, and intensive pathogen characterization when problems occurred. CONCLUSIONS: The significance of zoonosis and vector surveillance was recognized through this investigation, where we found differences in target diseases, and type of operation. The results should be utilized for generation of more useful and efficient surveillance systems in Japan.

AB  - We summarize an unusual postoperative wound infection that was caused by Pasteurella multocida from a house cat licking the incision in an obese gynecologic oncology patient. A 48-year-old morbidly obese woman had a wound abscess 6 weeks after hysterectomy and panniculectomy for a International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IA grade 1 endometrial cancer. P multocida was cultured from the abscess and the patient was treated with drainage and intravenous antibiotics. Further history revealed that her house cat had licked the wound. P multocida wound infection is a potential complication for people with dog or cat contact postoperatively. Penicillin G is the antibiotic of choice for treatment.

AB  - The emergence of rabies among terrestrial wildlife poses increasing but poorly defined risks to people. In particular, events leading to human exposure to rabies virus via mammalian reservoirs remain elusive. Thus, we determined those risk factors associated with human exposure to rabies-positive animals during a raccoon rabies epizootic in Connecticut. Existing passive surveillance data on animal rabies tests in Connecticut from 1991 through 1994 were evaluated for demographic, ecological, and behavioral characteristics of human exposure. Of 2,525 rabies-positive terrestrial animals identified, human contact was reported on 556 occasions (22%) and involved at least 939 individuals. The annual incidence of exposure rose from none during 1985-1990 to 66 in 1991 and then averaged 291 during 1992-1994. Exposure was most often indirect in nature, involved a rabies-positive raccoon, was mediated through a domestic animal, and occurred most frequently either near or inside t!
 he!
 home. These results suggest that human exposure to rabid animals represents a significant, reemerging public health concern in the United States. Analysis of the epizootiology of rabies infection and of individual exposure risks could reduce inappropriate administration of rabies postexposure prophylaxis, as well as inform other proposed interventions.

AB  - Between 1993 and 1998, 10 cases of clinical hantavirus infection were diagnosed in Brazil. Hantavirus-specific IgM, or positive immunohistochemical analysis for hantavirus antigen, or positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results for hantavirus RNA were used to confirm nine of these cases; eight were hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), and one was mild hantavirus disease. The remaining clinical case of hantavirus infection was fatal, and no tissue was available to confirm the diagnosis. During the first 7 months of 1998, five fatal HPS cases caused by a Sin Nombre-like virus were reported from three different regions in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil: two in March (Presidente Prudente Region), two in May (Ribeirao Preto Region), and one in July (Itapecerica da Serra Region). Epidemiologic, ecologic, and serologic surveys were conducted among case contacts, area residents, and captured rodents in five locations within the State of Sao Paulo in June o!
 f !
1998. Six (4.8%) of 125 case contacts and six (5.2%) of 116 area residents had IgG antibody to Sin Nombre virus (SNV) antigen. No case contacts had a history of HPS-compatible illness, and only one area resident reported a previous acute respiratory illness. A total of 403 rodents were captured during 9 nights of trapping (1969 trap nights). All 27 rodents that were found to be positive for IgG antibody to SNV antigen were captured in crop border and extensively deforested agricultural areas where four of the 1998 HPS case-patients had recently worked. The IgG antibody prevalence data for rodents suggest that Bolomys lasiurus and perhaps Akodon sp. are potential hantavirus reservoirs in this state of Brazil.

AB  - Since its recognition as a human pathogen in the early 1970s, Campylobacter jejuni has now emerged as the leading bacterial cause of food-borne gastroenteritis in developed countries. Poultry, particularly chickens, account for the majority of human infections caused by Campylobacter. Reduction or elimination of this pathogen in the poultry reservoir is an essential step in minimizing the public health problem; however, farm-based intervention measures are still not available because of the lack of understanding of the ecological aspects of C. jejuni on poultry farms. Although Campylobacter is highly prevalent in poultry production systems, how poultry flocks become infected with this organism is still unknown. Many investigations indicate that horizontal transmission from environmental sources is the primary route of flock infections by Campylobacter. However, some recent studies also suggest the possibility of vertical transmission from breeder to progeny flocks. The!
  t!
ransmission of the organism is not well understood, but it is likely to be through both vertical and horizontal transmission and may be affected by the immune status of the poultry host and the environmental conditions in the production system. Intervention strategies for Campylobacter infection in poultry should consider the complex nature of its transmission and may require the use of multiple approaches that target different segments of the poultry production system.

AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, particularly the O157(:H7) serogroup, has become a worldwide public health concern. Since cattle feces are often implicated as the source of E. coli O157 in human infections, considerable resources have been devoted to defining the epidemiology and ecology of E. coli O157 in cattle environments so that control might begin at the farm level. Diagnostic limitations and the complexity of often interrelated microbial, animal, herd, environmental and production factors have hindered the determination of the epidemiology, ecology and subsequent farm-level control of E. coli O157. The widespread distribution of E. coli O157, the transitory nature of fecal shedding, multiple potential environmental sources, lack of species specificity, and age-, feed- and time-related differences in cattle prevalence are documented. However, the significance and/or role of these factors in the epidemiology and ecology of E. coli O157 is still unclear. Cattle!

re a major source of E. coli O157, but it may be simplistic to believe that most herds are relatively closed systems with small percentages of cattle serving as true reservoirs. Practical on-farm control may require explicit definitions of the seemingly complex system(s) and the microbial, animal, herd, environmental and production factors involved in themultiplication, maintenance and transmission of E. coli O157.

AB  - AIMS: To characterize a number of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) isolates from sheep and to discuss the potential of these isolates as human pathogens. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twelve different O-groups and seven different H-types were identified by standard serotyping methods. The most common serotypes were O5:NM, O6:H10, O91:NM and O128:NM. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for the detection of virulence factor genes. Of 102 isolates, 86.3% carried stx1 and 83% of these were also positive in the stx1OX3-specific PCR. stx2 was carried by 55.9% of the isolates and 77.2% of these were also positive in the stx2d-specific PCR. The Vero cell assay showed high toxin production in 70.6% of the isolates. None of the isolates carried eae. CONCLUSIONS: The study supports the animal-host relationship suggested in other studies with STEC serogroups O5, O91 and O128 strongly associated with sheep. Most sheep STEC carry stx1OX3 (except O91) and the dominating stx2!
  v!
ariant is stx2d. One stx profile clearly dominates within a serotype. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: In spite of the predominance of certain sheep-associated STEC, sheep cannot be excluded as carriers of human pathogenic STEC.

AB  - The anaerobic intestinal spirochaete Brachyspira pilosicoli commonly colonizes the large intestine of a number of species, including chickens and human beings. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether an isolate of B. pilosicoli recovered from an HIV-infected patient with diarrhoea could infect and cause disease in adult chickens. Over a 4-week period following experimental infection, a group of eight inoculated chickens showed a persistent and significant increase in faecal water content ( approximately 6-7 %). The faeces of three of the eight birds became culture-positive, and remained so. At post-mortem examination, no specific pathological changes were found, and no spirochaetal attachment to the caecal epithelium was observed. These findings confirm that B. pilosicoli strains can infect across species barriers and cause chronic mild diarrhoea in intact adult chickens.

AB  - On a farm housing cattle and goats an abortion storm occurred affecting 50% of the goats during the lambing season 2000/2001. In one of three investigated caprine abortions Chlamydophila abortus could be identified as etiology. During this time a pregnant woman (pregnancy week 19/20) had contact with aborting goats. She developed a severe generalized infection and aborted. The placenta contained Chlamydophila abortus shown by immunohistochemistry and PCR. Aim of the present case report is to alert veterinarians about the potential zoonotic risk of ovine/caprine abortions.

AB  - We describe a model of microparasite transmission within a multigroup managed farming system. The model was formulated to represent transmission of Escherichia coli O157 within a typical UK dairy herd and was used to suggest possible on-farm control strategies. The model includes birth, death, maturation, the dry/lactating cycle and various types of transmission (i.e. direct, pseudovertical (representing direct faecal-oral transmission between dam and calf within the first 48 h) and indirect (via free-living infectious units in the environment)). A combination of numerical and analytical techniques was used to analyse the model. We found that pseudovertical transmission and indirect transmission via infectious units in the 'general' environment can lead to more groups being affected, but otherwise have relatively little effect on the invasion criteria. To reduce infection within the herd, we suggest that efforts be directed at reducing the opportunity for group-specifi!
 c !
indirect transmission-particularly within the weaned group.

AB  - The last half of the 20th Century witnessed an increase in the occurrence and recognition of urban zoonoses caused by members of the genera Bartonella, Coxiella, Ehrlichia, and Rickettsia, all traditionally considered to be members of the family Rickettsiaceae. In recent years, new human pathogens (Bartonella elizabethae, Bartonella henselae, and Rickettsia felis) have been recognized in urban environments. Other newly recognized pathogens (Ehrlichia chaffeensis and Ehrlichia phagocytophila in the United States) have sylvan zoonotic cycles but are present in urban areas because their vertebrate hosts and associated ectoparasitic arthropod vectors are able to survive in cities. Still other agents, which were primarily of historical importance (Bartonella quintana) or have not traditionally been associated with urban environments (Rickettsia rickettsii), have been recognized as causes of human disease in urban areas. Some diseases that have traditionally been associated !
 wi!
th urban environments, such as rickettsialpox (caused by Rickettsia akari) and murine typhus (caused by Rickettsia typhi), still occur in large cities at low or undetermined frequencies and often go undetected, despite the availability of effective measures to diagnose and control them. In addition, alternate transmission cycles have been discovered for Coxiella burnetii, Rickettsia prowazekii, and R. typhi that differ substantially from their established, classic cycles, indicating that the epidemiology of these agents is more complex than originally thought and may be changing. Factors leading to an increase in the incidence of illnesses caused by these bacteria in urban areas include societal changes as well as intrinsic components of the natural history of these organisms that favor their survival in cities. Transovarial and transstadial transmission of many of the agents in their arthropod hosts contributes to the highly focal nature of many of the diseases they cause b!
 y !
allowing the pathogens to persist in areas during adverse times when vertebrate amplifying hosts may be scarce or absent. Domesticated animals (primarily cats, dogs, and livestock) or commensal rodents [primarily Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) and house mice (Mus musculus)] can serve as vertebrate amplifying hosts and bring these agents and their ectoparasitic arthropod vectors into direct association with humans and help maintain transmission cycles in densely populated urban areas. The reasons for the increase in these urban zoonoses are complex. Increasing population density worldwide, shifts in populations from rural areas to cities, increased domestic and international mobility, an increase in homelessness, the decline of inner-city neighborhoods, and an increase in the population of immunosuppressed individuals all contribute to the emergence and recognition of human diseases caused by these groups of agents. Due to the focal nature of infections in urban areas, contr!
 ol!
 or prevention of these diseases is possible. Increased physician awareness and public health surveillance support will be required to detect and treat existing urban infections caused by these agents, to determine the disease burden caused by them, to design and implement control programs to combat and prevent their spread, and to recognize emerging or resurging infections caused by members of these genera as they occur.

AB  - HISTORY AND ADMISSION FINDINGS: A 36-year-old woman initially noticed a red spot, about pea-sized, with a central pimple over the right eyebrow and a swollen submandibular lymph node. A pressure-sensitive, 4 cm large, node developed out of this small spot, with a central, black, tightly-adhering crust bearing several varioliform vesicles around its edge. In addition to swelling of the right half of the face, the patient had a fever up to 39.5 degrees C, general malaise, nausea and vomiting. Various antibiotics were ineffective. The woman was hospitalized with a diagnosis of facial erysipelas. She owned a cat which had developed a purulent nodule on a forepaw a few days before onset of the patient's disease. LABORATORY TEST: ESR and CRP were moderately elevated, no leukocytosis and blood cultures were sterile. Wound smears showed colonization with Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae. DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT AND COURSE: The patient's general condition improved un!
 de!
r initially calculated antibiotic dosages, which was later adapted to the measured resistance. The black-crusted nodes became larger, however, and incision was performed on the 8 th day after hospitalization, under the suspicion of fluctuation. However, no pus was removed, but there was massive inflammatory infiltration of the soft tissue. Examination of samples of skin and part of the crust revealed orthopox virus (cowpox virus). Spontaneous healing followed within 3 weeks, leaving only a small scar. CONCLUSIONS: This was a cowpox virus in the sense of a zoonosis transmitted by the cat. In Germany, now that smallpox has been eradicated, the clinical presentation of infections with the orthopox virus, which are closely related to variola virus, are too little recognized. Atopic and immunocompromised patients are at risk of a cutaneous dissemination with a more severe course of the infectious illness; even a lethal outcome has been reported in Germany.

AB  - Sporotricosis is a ubiquitous mycosis characterized by nodular lesions of the cutaneous or subcutaneous tissues and adjacent lymphatics that usually suppurate and ulcerate. Secondary spread to the articular surface and bone or dissemination to the central nervous system, genitourinary tract or lungs is also possible. All forms of sporothricosis are caused by a single species, Sporothrix schenkii. In the great majority of cases the fungus gains entrance into the body through trauma to the skin with some kind of plant materials such as thorns or splinters. Zoonotic transmission is also possible and several animals are implicated. This kind of transmission is most frequently a professional hazard of people dealing with animals but in some parts of the world, including Rio de Janeiro city and metropolitan region, an increase in transmission by pet cats has been noted. In these cases the infection may be observed in the family environment, an important epidemiological consi!

AB  - The change of the dominant strains of intestinal viruses in the different regions of Russia during 1980-2001 was analyzed. In the North-Western regions the following dynamics was observed: enteroviruses ECHO 4, 6, 14, 30, Koksaki B 5, 6, ECHO 4, 11, 20, rotaviruses, new enteroviruses (serotypes 68-71). The last years the polytype of agents is registered. The prevalence of enteroviruses Koksaki A5, B5, ECHO 7, 13, 24, 30, new enteroviruses (serotype 70) is observed in the Far-Eastern region of Russia. Koksaki A, B, ECHO, new enteroviruses (serotypes 70, 71) were noted in the Central and Southern regions. The standard bacteriological examination of 158 patients who had come from the epidemic focus of acute intestinal infections (AII) showed that the agents were in 33 (21%) patients (in 19%--Sh. Flexneri 2a and in 2%--EPIR O124). In the remaining 125 (79%) persons the etiological agent wasn't detected. The additional investigation of fecal and blood samples obtained from !
 al!
l admitted patients showed that among the AII agents of uncertain etiology rotaviruses (49%), ECHO viruses (18%) and Koksaki A (8%) prevailed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of cryptosporidiosis among groups at risk (animal handlers) and among domestic animals. DESIGN: Comparative study with zoonotic aspect. METHOD: Stool samples were collected from 60 animal handlers, 175 non-animal handlers and 198 domestic animals (60 cows, 45 sheep, 45 goats, 25 horses and 23 camels). Direct smear method and then formalin-ether sedimentation method were carried out for stool samples to detect intestinal parasites. Faecal smears were prepared from the sediment and stained by the modified Ziehl-Neelsen method for the recovery of red-pink oocysts of Cryptosporidium. RESULTS: Out of the 60 animal handlers, 30 (50%) were found to be positive for intestinal parasites compared to 26 (14.8%) of non-animal handlers (P < 0.01). Cryptosporidium oocysts were found to be excreted by three (5%) animal handlers and two (1.14%) of the non-animal handlers (P > 0.05). Cryptosporidiosis was also diagnosed in 20%, 13.3%, 17.7% and !
 12!
% of cattle, sheep, goats and horses respectively. No single positive case was detected among the examined camels. CONCLUSION: Veterinarians, butchers and breeders should be aware of the disease among farm animals in order to avoid great losses and to prevent its transmission to humans.

AB  - The epidemiology of chronic diarrhoea in adults with late-stage HIV infection was investigated in a prospective study in Bangkok, Thailand. During this investigation, 34 Cryptosporidium isolates were obtained from the faeces of 36 patients, with mean CD4(+) counts of only 14 x 10(6) CD4(+) cells/litre (range = 2 x 10(6) - 53 x 10(6)/litre), who had symptomatic cryptosporidiosis. Genotyping of these isolates, by RFLP analysis and DNA sequencing of the hypervariable region of the 18S rRNA gene, indicated that only 17 (50%) were of the C. parvum human genotype. The rest were of C. meleagridis (seven), the C. parvum 'bovine' genotype (five), C. felis (three) and C. canis (two). Extensive genotypic heterogeneity was observed among the C. parvum isolates, and two other isolates, one of C. meleagridis and the other of C. felis, produced atypical restriction patterns and were only identified by sequencing. This appears to represent the first report of C. canis and the 'bovine'!

AB  - The knowledge of anthrax as a disease and its importance as a zoonosis in the Greco-Roman world is revealed through a selection of classical texts and mythological sources, taking into account evidence of reworking and reuse of these texts up until the nineteenth century. The numerous names given to the disease throughout history and their linguistic origins will also be examined in this paper. The narrative of the epizoonoses in Noricum in Virgil's Georgics; taken by several to represent a description of an anthrax epidemic, and which had a great influence in written works on veterinary medicine up until the discovery of bacteria, will be given particular attention. The crucial term is "Sacer Ignis", synonymous for several different human and animal diseases through time. This term will be analysed in terms of linguistic origin and the changes in meaning it acquired throughout the centuries.

AB  - Over the past few years, the cercarial dermatitis has become a new problem of public health, obviously linked to the prolonged stay of migrant birds on our territory. This is a skin affection characterized by pruriginous and papulous eruptions caused by penetration of avian bilharzian larvae under the skin. These larvae are emitted by molluscs, mostly limneids. In aquatic birds, especially in migrating Anatidae, these larvae reach the visceral vessels, become adults in a few weeks, lay eggs, then degenerate. Corresponding miracidia contaminate new limneids. Since 1993, the total number of annual cases of cercarial dermatitis has increased from only ten to thousands in France and the affection rages in pools where limneids, migrating water birds and swimmers gather together. Fever, respiratory and/or digestive allergic symptoms appear in some cases. This clinical pattern has encouraged to undertake research on the future of these bilharzian larvae in mammals organism. A!
  p!
reliminary investigation on a rodent model showed that, once the skin barrier had been crossed, the schistosomulae migrated into the lungs of the host; there they survived a week and induced lesions. The goal of this study is to carry on the research, over a longer period, after exposure to cercariae, simultaneously in mammals and birds, with two species of bilharziae present in France. The selected models are the gerbil Meriones unguiculatus for mammals, and the ducks Anas platyrhynchos and Cairina moschata, for birds. 5 M. unguiculatus and 2 A. platyrhynchos were exposed to cercariae emitted by Radix auricularia; 2 gerbils and 5 A. platyryhnchos to larvae of R. peregra, 3 C. moschata to larvae emitted by two species of molluscs: 70-230 from R. auricularia and 330-585 from R. peregra. 5 gerbils died between 2 and 5 weeks after exposure, 2 gerbils sacrificed early, served as control animals for skin manifestations. Eight ducks were sacrificed between 2 and 4 weeks after; the!
  2!
 last ones, exposed several times, were sacrificed respectively 7 and 13 weeks after the first exposure. Visceral and skin samples were submitted to histological study. The control gerbils developed skin dermatitis. In ducks, R. auricularia was the vector of Trichobilharzia franki, whose selective dwelling site was the mesentery; R. peregra was the vector of an indeterminate species found in the lungs and nose. This species is called Bilharzia sp. in this study. The ducks, exposed to two kinds of larvae, displayed worms in these two main locations. In gerbils, T. franki induced lesions in the mesenteric veins and the peritoneum. Bilharzia sp. gave rise to lesions in lung arteries, pleura and liver veins. Vascular changes encompassed endothelitis and lymphocytic vasculitis, while serosa displayed mesothelial hyperplasia. The types of lesions observed in gerbils were noticed in ducks, and, according to the species of bilharzia, in the homologous viscera. Additional foreign bod!
 y !
granulomas centred on worm's debris or their eggs, and vascular thromboses were present, too. In addition, ducks displayed lesions involving several other viscera including the intestine, the kidneys and the peripheral nerves. These changes were multiple and diffuse in C. moschata exposed to two species of bilharziae. They were observed mainly in mesenteric and intestinal vessels, pulmonary arteries and hepatic veins. In gerbils, the lesions persisted 2 to 5 weeks after exposure, but worms were not identified in the neighbouring tissues near the damaged vessels. In ducks, lesions were important between 2 and 7 weeks after exposure; they co-existed with live or dead worms, sometimes paired, with or without eggs. The hepatic lesions regressed 13 weeks, after exposure. In mammals and birds, young worms could migrate into the same visceral vessels, and stimulating formation of persistent lesions. In individuals exposed to the same cercariae, development of similar lesions would !
 be!
 probable.

AB  - Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) are dementing diseases and have been known to affect humans for over 90 years. The most common of these is the sporadic form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD), followed by its familial (fCJD) and an iatrogenic (iCJD) form. 1996 a variant of CJD (vCJD) has been described in the UK, of which so far 131 cases have been observed worldwide. Specific biochemical and neuropathological signatures allow to distinguish between vCJD and sCJD and lead to the hypothesis that vCJD is due to transmission of BSE prions to humans. Although promising therapeutical approaches are being investigated, human TSE remain untreatable entities. Thus preventive measures are essential. In Switzerland the population has been exposed to BSE prions, too, but no case of vCJD as described in the UK has been observed until now. Since 2001, however, a so far unexplained increase of sCJD cases is being observed. [References: 23]

AB  - Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are degenerative disorders affecting the central nervous system (CNS) occurring in a variety of species. The causative agent is thought to be composed of an abnormal form of the host encoded prion protein (PrPC), termed PrPSc. The conformational change of PrPC into PrPSc can occur spontaneously, however, it can also be induced by PrPSc. Prion diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), scrapie and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob-Disease (vCJD) are most likely caused by peripheral uptake of prions. The process by which prions proceed to the CNS following peripheral uptake is referred to as neuroinvasion. Infection with prions is thought to occur in two phases: After ingestion prions first replicate in lymphatic tissue and then gain access to the CNS via peripheral nerves. Studies looking at the biochemical and clinical characteristics of BSE and vCJD demonstrated that BSE is most likely responsible for vCJD in humans. [Re!

AB  - Current trends in epidemic manifestation of some bacterial zoonoses with natural focality and their role in human infectious pathology have been reviewed and analyzed. Update information on the etiological agents of "emerging" and "re-emerging" infections--Astrakhan spotted fever, bartonellosis, ixodes tick-borne borrelioses, monocytic erhrlichiosis and canine brucellosis, recently isolated on the territory of Russia, is presented. The main factors at play in the process of urbanization of bacterial zoonoses are discussed. [References: 40]

AB  - Zoonotic babesiosis has received increased attention recently, due mainly to the interest in tick-borne zoonotic diseases generated by the emergence of Lyme borreliosis and to increased awareness of diagnostic and treatment difficulties associated with co-infection cases. The vast majority of European cases have been caused by Babesia divergens in splenectomised patients, and although rare, this disease is very dangerous, requiring aggressive treatment. The use of atovaquone, a recently developed anti-protozoan agent for human treatment, may be considered in future cases. Most human babesiosis caused by B. microti have occurred in the north-eastern states of the USA and can affect spleen-intact as well as asplenic patients. The majority of infections are subclinical or follow a mild chronic course, but dangerous acute infections can occur in immunocompromised patients. The role of B. microti in apparently unresponsive cases of Lyme borreliosis and treatment of co-infec!
 ti!
ons require further investigation. The zoonotic potential of B. microti in Europe is still unresolved, but the vector competence of Ixodes ricinus for at least some European (and American) strains has been demonstrated. [References: 28]

AB  - Considerable progress continues to be made in understanding chlamydial organisms, their host species, diagnosis, and treatment. (1-3) Thus, national guidelines are updated annually to provide a standardized approach to handling infections in humans and birds. (2-3) Prior to development of these guidelines, considerable variation in approach by state agencies has been documented. (39) A more recent national assessment of state regulations and procedures has not been conducted. Decreasing imports of birds and increasing education may contribute to a reduction in human risk from avian infections. Keeping new birds separate from old birds in aviaries and poultry production facilities may reduce the incidence of avian chlamydiosis. Although wide-scale testing of birds may not be cost effective, (28) focal testing and treatment may help reduce human risk. The recent loss of a major source for pelleted feed for small birds, such as budgerigars, was a severe setback for veteri!

rians and local agencies in managing this disease. However, new medication formulas under development may help to address this problem. (2-3) [References: 39]

AB  - Fascioliasis is now imposing itself as a zoonotic disease in sheep and cattle raising countries. In Egypt, human fascioliasis is increasing. During the years 1994 to 1997 the overall slaughtered animals in Egyptian abattoirs was 2,003,200 sheep and goats, 2,624,239 cattle and 3,536,744 buffaloes. The overall rates of fascioliasis were 2.02% for sheep and goats, 3.54% for cattle and 1.58% for buffaloes. Macroscopic examination of sheep liver showed up to 100 flukes per liver inside a largely dilated thick walled bile ducts. Cattle liver showed up to 275 flukes per liver inside thickened dilated and calcareous bile ducts with offensive yellowish brown bile. Buffaloes liver showed up to 330 flukes per liver. Microscopic examination showed mainly thickened wall, hyperplasia and marked fibrosis. The discussion focused on the zoonotic importance of fascioliasis in Egypt, diagnosis, treatment and prevention. No doubt, adequate control of fascioliasis is more or less a problem!
 , !
since it requires the control of snail intermediate host(s) and control of infection in all affected animals and man.

AB  - In order to shed some light on the different opinions regarding the importance of Salmonella infections in dogs, we gathered some data from our laboratory database. Of the 6589 faecal samples from diarrhoeic dogs examined, 69 (1%) yielded Salmonella spp. Another eleven isolates were cultured from materials other than faeces. If Salmonella spp. can be cultured directly from faeces, this should be interpreted as clinically significant; however, even if the organism is found only after enrichment it may still be a clinical case. Antibiotic therapy is indicated in all dogs that are severely ill or have systemic infection, fluoroquinolones or trimethoprim/sulphonamides being drugs of choice. Double-blind placebo-controlled studies of humans with gastroenteritis have shown that the length of postconvalescent excretion of Salmonella is not affected by antimicrobials. For the elimination of the carrier state, however, fluoroquinolones are successful in human medicine. Salmonel!
 la!
e are zoonotic agents and transmission from dog to man has been reported. This should be taken into account when deciding on antimicrobial therapy. Of our isolates (n = 80), 96% were susceptible to enrofloxacin, 94% to trimethoprim/sulphonamides, 94% to gentamicin, 86% to ampicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, 47% to cephalexin and 63% to tetracycline.

AB  - While outbreaks of animal anthrax zoonoses still regularly occur in France, little is known about the epidemiology links between them. We have used the eight-locus multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis typing technique against a collection of 50 Bacillus anthracis isolates from France. There were eight distinct genotypes belonging to two dissimilar genetic clusters. Regional strain patterns were observed, with the B2 genotypes prevalent in southern France and the A1a genotypes found only in northern France.

AB  - Campylobacter jejuni is a major cause of pediatric diarrhea in developing countries-free-ranging chickens are presumed to be a common source. Campylobacter strains from monthly surveillance and diarrhea cases were compared by means of restriction-fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), rapid amplified polymorphic DNA, and Lior serotyping. RFLP analysis of 156 human and 682 avian strains demonstrated identical strains in chickens and humans in 29 (70.7%) of 41 families, and 35%-39% of human isolates from diarrhea and nondiarrhea cases were identical to a household chicken isolate. Isolation of the same RFLP type from a household chicken and a human within 1 month was highly protective against diarrhea (odds ratio, 0.07; P<.005). Campylobacter strains from symptomatic humans were unlikely to be identical to strains recently carried by household chickens, limiting the potential benefits from household-based control measures.

AB  - Campylobacter jejuni isolates of human, canine, feline, bovine and poultry origin were investigated for their genomic diversity using O-antigen typing (n = 271), SmaI (n = 158) and XhoI (n = 158) macrorestriction analysis and ERIC-PCR (n = 107). The O-antigens O:1/44, O:2, O:4 complex, O:37. O:40 were identified and 53.7% of the human and 56.1% of the animal strains were typable with the available antisera. Two ERIC-PCR pattern groups were generated representing human and animal strains as well as those exclusively of animal origin. XhoI macrorestriction analysis also distinguished 'human' and 'non-human' strain clusters, but by SmaI restriction mainly serotype-associated clusters were found. In conclusion, genomic differences may occur between 'human' and 'non-human' strains and this may reflect their potential to overcome the barrier from animals to humans.

AB  - Although transmission of human hepatitis B virus (HBV) variants to nonhuman primates is well documented, it remains to be elucidated whether nonhuman primate HBV is transmissible to humans. The prevalence and transmission routes of gibbon HBV were analysed in 101 captive gibbons in Thailand. Approximately 40 % of these animals showed at least one marker of HBV infection; 19 animals were chronic HBV carriers, characterized by elevated levels of alanine amino transferase and the presence of HBV DNA. Some of the chronic animals were found to be anti-HBc (HBV core antigen) negative (4 of 19), while precore promoter point mutations (nt 1762 or 1764) were determined in four animals by RFLP analysis. Phylogenetic tree analysis of the complete surface gene sequences revealed that gibbon viruses clustered separately from hepadnaviruses of other hosts. Evidence for horizontal and vertical transmission in captive gibbons was obtained. HBV DNA was also detected in the saliva of HB!

carrier gibbons. Although some of the animal caretakers at the Krabok Koo Wildlife Breeding Centre were found to be chronic HBV carriers, genotype and sequence analysis did not reveal any evidence for zoonotic disease transmission.

AB  - The survey of 326 human blood samples in the endemic area of Surat Thani and Narathiwat, the provinces in the south of Thailand, revealed that 5 of them were infected with Brugia malayi. Similarly, 53 feline blood samples were also investigated and found that 15 of the domestic cats were also infected with B. malayi. Upon the examination of human and feline blood specimens, a pair of human and domestic cat stayed in the same house and region. The periodicities of human B. malayi and feline B. malayi were similar as well as the results of Giemsa and acid phosphatase stained blood films of microfilaria positive cases. Likewise, the PCR-RFLP profile of Hha I repeat genes and PCR amplification of Trans-Spliced Leader Exon I (SLX) demonstrated that 15 samples the feline B. malayi were the same as those of human B. malayi. The data indicated that domestic cat plays an important role as the animal reservoir for B. malayi in the endemic areas of Thailand. Copyright 2002 Elsevi!

AB  - Leishmaniasis, an important zoonosis, was serologically found to coexist with leptospirosis, another important zoonosis. The proportion of dogs positive to leishmaniasis was approximately 36%. Significant differences were observed between dogs located in greater Athens and those from rural Greece. Although dogs from either of the groups had a similar chance to be infected, rural dogs had significantly (p<0.01) higher titers (1/1,600) than dogs from greater Athens. Thirty two of the 344 dog serum samples examined had positive antibody titers against Leptospira spp., but only 13 of them had titers of 1/400 or over to both of the infectious agents. Whilst noted differences in the antibody titers of samples with evidence of leishmaniasis and leptospirosis were not observed their coexistence may complicate the clinical outcome of cases of mixed infection.

AB  - A case of septic shock caused by Streptococcus suis type 2 occurred in a 36-year-old truck driver who transported pigs. Here, as well as in nearly all other cases of S. suis infections reported to date, close occupational contact with pork or pigs preceded the incident. This epidemiological link may be explained by the frequent occurrence of S. suis as a commensal and opportunistic germ in pigs. In order to assess the potential risk for an infection with S. suis, 132 workers in pig slaughtering, pork dissecting and processing industries were examined in a cross sectional study for the occurrence of S. suis in their pharynx, and compared with an age and sex matched control group. The evaluation of the pharyngeal swabs showed an atypical colonisation by a variety of microorganisms in some of the employees who were so far healthy, but potentially at risk. The colonisation of the case group with S. suis amounted to 5.3%.

DNA fingerprint patterns suggested recent transmission. An investigation found no active cases of tuberculosis in humans; however, tuberculin skin-test conversions in humans were associated with training elephants and attending an elephant necropsy.

AB  - In 1998, an outbreak of acute encephalitis with high mortality rates among pig handlers in Malaysia led to the discovery of a novel paramyxovirus named Nipah virus. A multidisciplinary investigation that included epidemiology, microbiology, molecular biology, and pathology was pivotal in the discovery of this new human infection. Clinical and autopsy findings were derived from a series of 32 fatal human cases of Nipah virus infection. Diagnosis was established in all cases by a combination of immunohistochemistry (IHC) and serology. Routine histological stains, IHC, and electron microscopy were used to examine autopsy tissues. The main histopathological findings included a systemic vasculitis with extensive thrombosis and parenchymal necrosis, particularly in the central nervous system. Endothelial cell damage, necrosis, and syncytial giant cell formation were seen in affected vessels. Characteristic viral inclusions were seen by light and electron microscopy. IHC anal!
 ys!
is showed widespread presence of Nipah virus antigens in endothelial and smooth muscle cells of blood vessels. Abundant viral antigens were also seen in various parenchymal cells, particularly in neurons. Infection of endothelial cells and neurons as well as vasculitis and thrombosis seem to be critical to the pathogenesis of this new human disease.

AB  - The cause of Texas fever in cattle, which is characterised by lysis of erythrocytes leading to anaemia, icterus, haemoglobinuria, and death, remained unsolved for many decades and assorted theories were proposed as an explanation for a disease being transmitted by apparently healthy animals. From 1889 to 1893, Theobald Smith and Frederick L. Kilbourne could demonstrate in elegantly conducted experiments how the disease was spread from cattle to cattle by ticks serving as the vector of transmission. Furthermore, they were able to identify the pathogen of Texas fever, an intra-erythrocytic protozoan which Smith named Pyrosoma bigeminum. Today it is recognised that either of two species of the now renamed genus Babesia, Babesia bigemina and Babesia bovis, may be involved in Texas fever and that babesiosis is generally transmitted by ticks. In animals, genera like Boophilus spp., Dermacentor spp. and Rhipicephalus spp. are possible vectors. The first case of tick-transmitt!
 ed!
 babesiosis in a human was reported by Skrabalo and Deanovic in 1957 and occurred near Ljubliana in the small town of Strmec, Croatia. In humans, the vectors of most reported cases are ticks of the genus Ixodes, which are among the most predominant ticks in Austria. However, cases of human babesiosis in Austria remain to be studied. Smith and Kilbourne's work was the first demonstration that ticks transmit disease of any kind. Furthermore, by proving that ticks carry Babesia microti--which causes babesiosis in animals and humans--this is the first account of a zoonotic disease and the foundation of all later work on the animal host and the arthropod vector.

AB  - At least six tick-borne zoonoses are transmitted by members of the Ixodes ricinus species complex in northern hemisphere temperate regions, and include the relatively recently emerged diseases, Lyme borreliosis and ehrlichiosis. An understanding of the biology of these ticks is essential for the prevention and control of the zoonoses they transmit and this review summarises established knowledge in addition to addressing recent work on host specificity of ticks, inter- and intra-specific biological variation and factors affecting tick distribution and abundance.

AB  - Cross-species transfers of pathogens (zoonoses) cause some of the most virulent diseases, including anthrax, hantavirus and Q fever. Zoonotic infections occur when a pathogen moves from its reservoir host species into a secondary host species. Similarly, commensal infections often have a primary reservoir location within their hosts' bodies from which they rarely cause disease symptoms, but commensals such as Neisseria meningitidis cause severe disease when they cross into a different body compartment from their normal location. Both zoonotic and commensal infections cause either mild symptoms or severe disease, but rarely intermediate symptoms. We develop a mathematical model for studying three factors that affect the probability of severe disease: the size of the inoculum, the route of inoculation and the frequency of naturally occurring infections that do not cause symptoms but do induce protective immunity (vaccinating inoculations). With a single route of infectio!
 n,!
 increasing pathogen density causes inoculations to develop more often into disease rather than asymptomatic vaccinations that provide protective immunity. With two routes of infection, it may happen that a lower density of a pathogen or of a particular antigenic variant leads to a relatively higher frequency of disease-inducing versus vaccinating inoculations. This reversal occurs when one route of infection tends to vaccinate against relatively common pathogens but less often vaccinates against relatively rare pathogens, whereas the other route of infection is susceptible to disease-inducing inoculation even at relatively low pathogen density.

AB  - Ongoing endemics and epidemics of prion disease afflict several species of ruminants regularly consumed by humans. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is epidemic in British cattle, and is now found in the cattle of more than 20 countries. A large, and apparently growing, epidemic of chronic wasting disease plagues deer and elk in North America. Finally, scrapie has been endemic in the sheep of most countries for many decades. It was once assumed that humans were not susceptible to these ruminant forms of prion disease, but an outbreak of a new form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) among young Britons, almost certainly due to dietary exposure to BSE-contaminated beef, has disproved this supposition. Although all prion diseases share the same fundamental pathologic mechanism, transmission between species is sometimes inefficient. The basis of this "species barrier" is incompletely understood, but interspecies differences in the amino acid sequence of the prion prot!
 ei!
n and the strain of prions involved play critical roles. Reliable experimental models for determining the resistance of humans to animal prion diseases do not yet exist. It is possible that animal to human transmission of prion disease may manifest as CJD with unusual characteristics, but this is not necessarily the case. In the absence of a reliable means for determining the susceptibility of humans to animal prion disease, measures to minimize human exposure to animal prions should be emphasized. [References: 37]

AB  - The fear of terrorist attacks has increased since the events of 11 September 2001 in New York. In the weeks following the terrorist attack, letters containing anthrax spores were received at various locations in the USA. This shows that bioterrorism is possible and that is necessary to be prepared for the potential release of biological agents. Such agents can be distributed not only via the air and drinking water but also via household pets. The aim of terrorist attacks, namely, the disruption of society and daily life, can be achieved in three ways, ways which are of importance to practising veterinarians, namely, via pets, via contamination of pet foods of animal origin, and by the spread of infectious animal diseases that have far-reaching economic consequences. These ways are discussed in this article, together with possible ways in which veterinarians can act to diminish the consequences of such an event.

AB  - Trichinellosis is a helminth zoonosis, which is known since long, but which is emerging or re-emerging in several regions of the world. During the last years the number of cases of trichinellosis in pigs and man in several East-European countries has increased very much due to the breakdown of the veterinary services because of the difficult political and socio-economic situation. In several third world countries on the other hand trichinellosis has become more important due to the increasing number of small traditional pig farms, in which the hygienic conditions are suboptimal. Furthermore, outbreaks of human trichinellosis have been reported due to recently discovered new species such as T. pseudospiralis and T. papuae. Over the last 25 years horsemeat has been more important as a source of human trichinellosis within the European Union than pork or wild boar meat. In Belgium, however, no cases of human trichinellosis have been reported since 1979. A review is presen!
 te!
d of the available data on animal trichinellosis in Belgium. The potential risk for the consumer is discussed. Finally, some suggestions are made for a new approach of trichinellosis control in Belgium and the European Union. [References: 41]

AB  - A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique was used for detection of the Leptospira interrogans rrs gene in kidney tissue from 115 rats, 50 zebu cattles and 13 pigs in an attempt to identify a possible animal reservoir of leptospirosis in Madagascar. In addition, serological testing of 105 individuals in close contact with animals was carried out. The PCR analysis was negative for all the samples tested and only one person was found seropositive at a low titer. The findings suggest that leptospirosis, if prevalent in Madagascar, is likely rare.

AB  - Investigations of 1167 dairy cows out of 105 herds with fertility disorders on secretion of Coxiella burnetii (C. burnetii) by the genitals as well as serological studies of these animals using ELISA demonstrated that C. burnetii infections are significantly associated with abortions but not with repeated inseminations without success or vaginal excretions. The demonstration of an increased risk of infections for persons caring for those dairy herds could be shown by a total of 253 serological studies. A comparison of these studies of farmers caring for dairy herds suffering from abortions a seroprevalence of > or = 20% showed that these persons revealed significantly more frequent antibodies against C. burnetii than farmers of the group compared with. Further studies showed that in herds suffering from abortions a seroprevalence of > or = 20% means an additional risk of infections of farmers. Vice versa abortions of the cows in herds with a seroprevalence of > or = 20!

AB  - Vector-borne viruses are no respecters of international boundaries. The recent outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and Yemen in September 2000 clearly sends a message that once pathogens cross their known geographic limits, they tend to adapt to the local ecology in order to survive and maintain transmission. This paper examines the various factors that may contribute to the establishment of RVF in the Arabian Peninsula (AP) and its possible spread to other countries. The annual influx of over 2 million pilgrims for the Hajj (annual pilgrimage for Muslims) in the KSA, as well as the large migrant population in this region, generates high human and animal traffic that presents a challenging agenda for public health. The potential risks within this period as well as other peculiar ecological factors are discussed.

AB  - To facilitate ecotourism and research, free-ranging mountain gorillas of Uganda have been habituated to humans. Testing of fecal samples of gorillas (n = 100), people sharing gorilla habitats (n = 62). and local pre- and postweaned cattle (n = 50) having access to these habitats with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated monoclonal antibodies revealed Giardia duodenalis cysts at prevalences of 2, 5, and 10%, respectively. The identification of G. duodenalis was confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization with 2 species-specific 18-bp oligonucleotide probes conjugated to hexachlorinated 6-carboxyfluorescein. The mean pathogen concentration was 2.5, 2.8, and 0.2 x 10(4) cysts/g of the gorilla, people, and cattle feces, respectively. All cyst isolates aligned with genotype (assemblage) A, as confirmed by polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing of a 130-bp region near the 5' end of the small subunit-ribosomal RNA gene. A single genotype (assemblage) A rec!
 ov!
ered from 3 genetically distant but geographically united host groups indicates anthropozoonotic transmission of G. duodenalis. A large percentage of the local community does not follow park regulations regarding the disposal of their fecal waste, as self-reported in a questionnaire. This genotype may have been introduced into gorilla populations through habituation activities and may have then been sustained in their habitats by anthropozoonotic transmission.

AB  - Some viral diseases are transmitted to human by arthropods (arboviroses), or by animals (zoonoses). Among more than 500 arboviruses and epizootic viruses that are classified into seven families, only a few are responsible for zoonoses or cause severe human diseases. Infected patients may show an acute disease associated with different symptoms, ranging from high fever to encephalitis, pulmonary distress, and haemorrhages. Some diseases show one or more of these symptoms and the factors responsible for severe outcomes, either linked to the virus, or to the host, or to the vector, remain poorly understood. Arboviroses and zoonoses are emerging or re-emerging diseases that need a multidisciplinary effort to control the propagation of the infectious agent and the pathogenesis in infected patients. Some viruses could be used for bioterrorism attacks. In virology, studies on the interactions of the viruses with their vectors and vertebrate hosts and on the pathophysiology of!
  t!
he infections will allow a better prevention of these diseases.

AB  - In 1997, 18 people were infected in Hong Kong with an avian influenza A(H5N1) virus from chicken. This type of interspecies transmission was never detected before and could have resulted in the development of a pandemic strain. The occurrence suggests that the pig is not needed for the emergence of pandemic influenza virus strains. Characteristics of the strains involved are discussed in relation to the question why, on the one hand, these strains were able to infect humans but on the other hand were not able to start an epidemic.

AB  - Worldwide pandemics of human influenza virus caused extensive morbidity and mortality around the world had been documented in the 20th century. However, the mechanisms involved in the emergence of novel influenza virus and the epidemiological factors leading to pandemics are unpredictable. Southern China is postulated as the epicentre of influenza epidemics due to its agricultural-based communities and high population density. Pandemic influenza viruses are through to arise from avian viruses through genetic reassortment among influenza viruses.An influenza virus (H5N1) known to infect only birds previously was found to infect human causing disease and death in Hong Knog in 1997 and the outbreak involved 18 patients with six deaths. Prior to the human outbreak, the H5N1 virus was found to cause extensive death in chickens in three farms in Hong Kong. The significance of this outbreak raised worldwide concern on the possibilities that such an influenza virus may become !
 th!
e next influenza pandemic strain. Investigations were initiated to find the source of the virus. In addition the extend of spread in individuals in contact with the index case and infected poultry was studied by H5-specific serology. Results demonstrated that individuals in close contact with the index case or with exposure to poultry were at risk of being infected. Out of the 18 cases of human infection, eleven had severe infection with symptoms of pneumonia and multi-organ failure. All severe cases presented with lower respiratory infection and lymphopenia and six eventually died. Case-fatality ratio was high among patients over 12 years of age (five out of nine).Control measures aimed at reducing exposure of human to potential H5-positive poultry were instituted which included culling of all poultry in Hong Kong, the segregation of water fowls and chicken, and the introduction of import control measures for chickens. Such measures had successfully controlled the outbreak !
 an!
d continuous surveillance of the poultry in Hong Kong of H5N1 infection is maintained to minimize future human exposure.

AB  - Influenza is a zoonotic disease caused by a constantly varying RNA virus resulting in a need for continuous surveillance to update human vaccines. Our knowledge indicates that the intermittent pandemics of influenza originate from influenza viruses or gene segments from influenza viruses in lower animals and birds. These pandemics can be mild to catastrophic. While we have learned a great deal about the ecology and molecular properties of "animal" influenza viruses, we do not have a system for comprehensive international surveillance. The 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic that originated from lower animals and the recent H5N1 bird flu incident in Hong Kong serves to remind us that influenza is an emerging disease. The challenge for the 21st century is to accumulate the necessary epidemiological data on animal influenza viruses so that an international surveillance system can be devised. This epidemiological data may provide clues on how to reduce interspecies transmissio!
 n !
of influenza. The separation of aquatic birds from other "land based" domestic poultry in Hong Kong after the H5N1 bird flu incident indicates that animal husbandry practices could influence the interspecies transmission of influenza viruses.

AB  - Dogs and cats are important members of many families; however, they can harbour gastrointestinal parasites that may infect their owners. Some of these parasites, e.g. Echinococcus sp., can have a significant impact on human health. However, with appropriate education, management and anthelmintic regimes, zoonotic transmission of these parasites can be minimised. [References: 33]

AB  - Neurocysticercosis, cystic echinococcosis and alveolar echinococcosis are the three major zoonotic larval cestodiases worldwide and threatening human life. Early therapeutic treatment based on early differential diagnosis at the early stage of infection and epidemiological surveillance with the expectation for control and prevention are the keys for improvement of quality of human life. Recent advances in (1). differential serodiagnosis of these three diseases, (2). molecular identification of human taeniid species and (3). polymorphism of mitochodrial DNA highly informative for future molecular epidemiology are reviewed in this article.

AB  - It is known that Helicobacter pylori is a cause of chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer disease in humans. However the origin and transmission of this bacterium has not been clearly explained. One of the suggested theories is transmission via raw milk from animals to human beings. In this study, the presence of H. pylori was investigated in sheep milk that is commonly consumed as human food. For this purpose, a total of 440 raw sheep milk samples collected from the Burdur region of Turkey were examined by specific cultural procedures, however, H. pylori was not isolated in any sample.

AB  - Giardia lamblia which parasitize humans belong to either of two genotypes, A or B, based on specific signature sequences in the 5' end of the small subunit (16S) ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. These two genotypes also were found in cysts from fecal samples of animal origin such as dogs, cats, some farm animals and wild animals. In addition, trophozoites recovered from cysts obtained from environmental samples belonged to these two genotypes as well, suggesting that the G. lamblia genotypes A and B are widespread and possibly zoonotic. Trophozoites were recovered from rats and these isolates might belong to another genotype of G. lamblia. Deer mice and one dog appeared to be parasitized by genotypes of Giardia with close affinity to G. microti. This species, therefore, also consists of a genotype complex.

AB  - Zoonotic diseases are an ever-present concern in small animal veterinary practice and are often overlooked. A variety of nonparasitic zoonotic diseases may be encountered in small animal practice, including cat scratch disease (bartonellosis), cat bite abscesses, rabies, leptospirosis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, salmonellosis, avian chlamydiosis, campylobacteriosis, dermatophytosis, and blastomycosis. These may cause human disease ranging from mild and self-limiting to fatal. The risk of development of a zoonotic disease can be lessened by early recognition of infected animals, proper animal handling, basic biosecurity precautions, and, most importantly, personal hygiene.

AB  - Toxocara canis and Ancylostoma spp. are geohelmints that parasites dogs and can eventually affect humans, mainly children, causing visceral and cutaneous larva migrans respectively, constituting a serious public health problem. This study was carried out in two towns located in the xerophilous forest Chaco salteno where humans live closely with many animals, including dogs. Hematological values and anti-Toxocara canis antibodies, determined by ELISA in serum, were evaluated in 98 children from this area. Thirty-six children presented with eosinophilia of 10% or higher in peripheral blood. Twenty out of 98 (20.4%) children had antibodies against antigen from L2 larvae of Toxocara canis. A high percentage (55.6%) of the children with eosinophilia presented anti-Toxocara canis antibodies. Nine children had multiple serpiginous lesions typical of cutaneous larva migrans. Feces from dogs were collected in the area where children lived, in order to search for parasite contam!
 in!
ation. Three different techniques of stool examination were employed and eggs were counted. Out of the 106 feces examined, parasites were found in 82 samples (77.4%). Ancylostoma spp eggs were found in 74 (69.8%) samples and eggs from Toxocara canis were found in 19 (17.2%). The average number of T. canis and Ancylostoma spp eggs/gr of feces, were 200 and 3,871 respectively. Giardia spp (14.5%), Trichuris vulpis (7.6%), Genus Endamoeba (2.8%) and Taenia spp (1.9%) were also identified in the stools. Sanitary control and health education in order to control these parasitoses are emphasized.

AB  - Cats co-occupy one third of all residences in the United States. As common household pets, they serve as sources of joy and companionship for their owners. However, feline ownership also comes with its own inherent risks, as cats can transmit an array of diseases to their owners, ranging from trivial to fatal ailments. By understanding the pathogenesis of cat-associated diseases, owners and their pets can live together with little risk of disease transmission. This article reviews cat-related diseases, with an emphasis on their prevention and management. [References: 70]

AB  - Comparison of tuberculosis epizootic tension with some parameters characterizing the epidemiological situation in areas with different incidence rates of cattle tuberculosis under present conditions showed their inverse correlation. It is suggested that with a drastic improvement of the epizootic situation, the cattle becomes an agent of natural immunization of inhabitants in poor districts, as evidenced not only by the lack of new cases of tuberculosis in human beings, but by an increase in cases with residual posttuberculous changes in the lung (14.1% of the stock breeders examined in the long poor tuberculosis area versus 3.7% in this infection-free area), as well as by high infection rates (74.2 versus 43.5%).

AB  - Unprecedented mortality occurred in bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) at DeGray Lake, Arkansas, during the winters of 1994-1995 and 1996-1997. The first eagles were found dead during November, soon after arrival from fall migration, and deaths continued into January during both episodes. In total, 29 eagles died at or near DeGray Lake in the winter of 1994-1995 and 26 died in the winter of 1996-1997; no eagle mortality was noted during the same months of the intervening winter or in the earlier history of the lake. During the mortality events, sick eagles were observed overflying perches or colliding with rock walls. Signs of incoordination and limb paresis were also observed in American coots (Fulica americana) during the episodes of eagle mortality, but mortality in coots was minimal. No consistent abnormalities were seen on gross necropsy of either species. No microscopic findings in organs other than the central nervous system (CNS) could explain the cause of !
 de!
ath. By light microscopy, all 26 eagles examined and 62/77 (81%) coots had striking, diffuse, spongy degeneration of the white matter of the CNS. Vacuolation occurred in all myelinated CNS tissue, including the cerebellar folia and medulla oblongata, but was most prominent in the optic tectum. In the spinal cord, vacuoles were concentrated near the gray matter, and occasional swollen axons were seen. Vacuoles were uniformly present in optic nerves but were not evident in the retina or peripheral or autonomic nerves. Cellular inflammatory response to the lesion was distinctly lacking. Vacuoles were 8-50 microns in diameter and occurred individually, in clusters, or in rows. In sections stained by luxol fast blue/periodic acid-Schiff stain, the vacuoles were delimited and transected by myelin strands. Transmission electron microscopy revealed intramyelinic vacuoles formed in the myelin sheaths by splitting of one or more myelin lamellae at the intraperiodic line. This lesion i!
 s !
characteristic of toxicity from hexachlorophene, triethyltin, bromethalin, isonicotinic acid hydrazide, and certain exotic plant toxins; however, despite exhaustive testing, no etiology was determined for the DeGray Lake mortality events. This is the first report of vacuolar myelinopathy associated with spontaneous mortality in wild birds.

AB  - Twelve separate outbreaks of confirmed cowpox, 10 involving humans, were reviewed. Six of the patients, including three children, had severe infections and five were admitted to hospital. In three outbreaks both people and cows were affected but it was not known how the infections entered the herds. In seven outbreaks no direct contact with cattle was established and clinical and serological examination failed to show evidence of cowpox in the bovine population. Comparison of these data with information about infections known to be enzootic in cattle leads to the suggestion that cows are not the natural reservoir of cowpox. This should be remembered when diagnosis is considered. The role of small wild animals as hosts and vectors of "cowpox" should be investigated.

AB  - Hantaviruses have emerged as agents of significant morbidity and mortality in human beings. These pathogens are maintained in nature as not clinically apparent, persistent infections in roden reservoirs, varying with each virus, and are shed via rodent feces, urine, and salivary excretions. Human exposure to hantaviruses principally occurs through the respiratory tract route and is focal and discontinuous, paralleling the distribution of virus in reservoir species and the likelihood of human-rodent interactions. Prior to 1993, hantaviruses were established etiologic agents of human febrile nephropathies and hematologic abnormalities on several continents, exclusive of North America. An episode of severe respiratory tract illness developed in association with a group of novel hantaviruses in the United States during 1993-1994, resulting in at least 98 confirmed cases of disease from 21 states and 51 deaths. Current evidence suggests that hantaviruses of zoonotic potenti!

AB  - Zoonotic diseases are an ever-present concern in small animal veterinary practice and are often overlooked. A variety of nonparasitic zoonotic diseases may be encountered in small animal practice, including cat scratch disease (bartonellosis), cat bite abscesses, rabies, leptospirosis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, salmonellosis, avian chlamydiosis, campylobacteriosis, dermatophytosis, and blastomycosis. These may cause human disease ranging from mild and self-limiting to fatal. The risk of development of a zoonotic disease can be lessened by early recognition of infected animals, proper animal handling, basic biosecurity precautions, and, most importantly, personal hygiene.

AB  - A man died in endocarditis due to listeriosis in the late autumn. He had been looking after two goats during the summer. Listeria monocytogenas was isolated from a rectal swab from one of the goats. The goat faeces isolate and the human blood isolate were of identical serovar. The two isolates, however, were shown to be different by multilocus electrophoretic enzyme analysis and ribotyping, as well as by biotyping. Thus, these results do not support the hypothesis that the man was infected by the goat.

AB  - We report about the infection of an 18-year-old man with an orthopox virus (OPV) which was transmitted by a cat. The infectious route from cat to man could be proved by epidemiological, virological and serological methods. The corresponding techniques are described. The patient had not been vaccinated against smallpox and was intensively immunosuppressed by medication on account of a severe endogeneous eczema combined with an allergic asthma bronchiale. A cyclic poxvirus disease developed with a generalised, partly confluent pox virus exanthema disseminated over the body. The clinical symptoms were similar to a "variola pustulosa haemorrhagica". The young man died of a lung embolism in the course of the intensive medical therapy. The haemorrhagic character of the pox virus pustules with central necrosis (pox navel) could be reproduced in the rabbit skin and on chorioallantois membranes. The pox virus isolated from the patient could be differentiated from variola, vacci!

a and monkeypox virus. It is a member of the group of "cowpox-like viruses". The environmental importance of these OPVs is discussed.

AB  - New developments in the field of Zoonosis research are discussed. They include: 1. New emerging viral zoonosis 2. Multicausal zoonoses 3. Genetic aspects of the origin of new zoonoses 4. Transmission of zoonoses to man through foodstuffs of animal origin 5. The environment and zoonoses. Continuous zoonosis research with new molecular biological techniques is a necessity. In the final analysis, there are no true limits in the field of infectiology. Such research requires cooperation between ecologists, zoologists, botanists, molecular biologists, physicians and veterinarians. [References: 16]

AB  - The heightened worldwide recognition of the health burden of tickborne infection derives largely from the increasing incidence of Lyme disease, human babesiosis, and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis, both individually and in concert. Because these infections share the same rodent reservoir and tick vector hosts, they can be cotransmitted to human hosts. Indeed, human coinfections involving various combinations of these pathogens are common, and some tend to be particularly severe. Diagnostic procedures and clinical management of the resulting disease syndrome is rendered complex by the diversity of pathogens involved and by the unusual diversity and duration of symptoms.
