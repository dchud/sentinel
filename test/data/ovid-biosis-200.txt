AB  - As new infectious diseases, such as West Nile virus, monkeypox, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) are recognized in the United States, there are critical questions about how these infectious diseases will affect pregnant women and their infants. In addition, the implications of bioterrorist attacks for exposed pregnant women need to be considered. In this article, the authors address the following questions for a number of infectious disease threats: (1) does pregnancy affect the clinical course of these novel infectious diseases?, (2) what are the implications for prophylaxis and treatment of exposed or infected pregnant women?, and (3) are these novel infectious diseases transmitted during pregnancy, labor and delivery, or breastfeeding?

AB  - Approximately 50% of the US population received smallpox vaccinations before routine immunization ceased in 1972 for civilians and in 1990 for military personnel. Several studies have shown long- term immunity after smallpox vaccination, but skepticism remains as to whether this will translate into full protection against the onset of orthopoxvirus- induced disease. The US monkeypox outbreak of 2003 provided the opportunity to examine this issue. Using independent and internally validated diagnostic approaches with >= 95% sensitivity and >= 90% specificity for detecting clinical monkeypox infection, we identified three previously unreported cases of monkeypox in preimmune individuals at 13, 29 and 48 years after smallpox vaccination. These individuals were unaware that they had been infected because they were spared any recognizable disease symptoms. Together, this shows that the US monkeypox outbreak was larger than previously realized and, more importantly, shows tha!
 t cross- protective antiviral immunity against West African monkeypox can potentially be maintained for decades after smallpox vaccination.

AB  - Vaccination with live vaccinia virus affords long- lasting protection against variola virus, the agent of smallpox. Its mode of protection in humans, however, has not been clearly defined. Here we report that vaccinia- specific B-cell responses are essential for protection of macaques from monkeypox virus, a variola virus ortholog. Antibody- mediated depletion of B cells, but not CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cells, abrogated vaccine- induced protection from a lethal intravenous challenge with monkeypox virus. In addition, passive transfer of human vaccinia-neutralizing antibodies protected nonimmunized macaques from severe disease. Thus, vaccines able to induce long- lasting protective antibody responses may constitute realistic alternatives to the currently available smallpox vaccine (Dryvax).

AB  - The use of classical smallpox vaccines based on vaccinia virus (W) is associated with severe complications in both naive and immune individuals. Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (WVA), a highly attenuated replication-deficient strain of W, has been proven to be safe in humans and immunocompromised animals, and its efficacy against smallpox is currently being addressed. Here we directly compare the efficacies of MVA alone and in combination with classical W-based vaccines in a cynomolgus macaque monkeypox model. The MVA-based smallpox vaccine protected macaques against a lethal respiratory challenge with monkeypox virus and is therefore an important candidate for the protection of humans against smallpox.

AB  - The Geneva Protocol of 1925 commits the signatory nations to refraining from the use of biological weapons. However, the terrorist assaults of September 2001 and, subsequently, the anthrax-containing letters are cause for great concerns: new threats to the security of nations are expected, as terrorist organizations seem to increasingly explore novel ways of spreading terror. In this context. naturally emerging diseases such as SARS, monkeypox or West Nile fever assume new importance because it is difficult to distinguish between natural epidemics and possible bioweapon assaults. Great efforts on the part of governments and public health authorities are necessary to counteract these threats.

AB  - Genes for TNF-binding proteins (CrmBs) of the variola virus (VARV), monkeypox virus (MPXV) or cowpox virus (CPXV) were isolated by PCR from viral genomes and expressed in a baculovirus system in the Sf21 insect cell line. Properties of the purified recombinant proteins were studied by various physicochemical and immunological methods. Using solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, it was shown that viral proteins inhibited hTNF binding with polyclonal anti-hTNF antibodies, with the efficiency of inhibition decreasing in the series VARV-CrmB > CPXV-CrmB > MPXV-CrmB. Biological activity of the recombinant protein preparations was assessed by their ability to neutralize TNF cytotoxicity on the L929 murine fibroblast cells line. CrmBs were shown to neutralize cytotoxicity of human, mouse, and rabbit TNF in a species-specific manner. It was also shown that the efficiency of VARV-CrmB in inhibiting hTNF cytotoxicity exceeded that of polyclonal anti-hTNF antibodies. Ort!
 hopoxviral CrmB proteins can provide a basis for development of new, anti-TNF drugs.

AB  - Novel strategies are required to combat pox virus infections, whether caused by escape of viruses such as monkeypox from indigenous areas or intentional release of smallpox. Anti-smallpox drugs with a unique mode of antiviral action, inhibition of transcription termination, were known but not therapeutically useful. Using a combinatorial method, variants of the basic isatin-beta-thiosemicarbazone structure were prepared and examined for cytotoxicity and antiviral activity in vaccinia virus- and cowpox virus-infected human cells. Potent and much more selective N-aminomethyl-isatin-beta-thiosemicarbazones were discovered.

AB  - Starting in the 1960, electron microscopy (EM) became widely applied also in viral diagnosis. During the 1970(th) and 80(th), many new agents were characterized from diagnostic cell cultures and clinical specimens. The wide introduction of ELISA- and PCR-techniques as well as cost-arguments recently reduced the role of EM in routine viral diagnosis. Compared to other diagnostic techniques, however, EM excells by speed and "open view", i.e. by the ability to detect also the "un-expected" without the need for specific reagents. As shown in 2003 by the elucidation of the SARS pandemia and the human monkey ox outbreak in US, EM is well suited as a safe, front-line diagnostic method in infectious diseases emergencies and/or in possible bioterrorist attacks.

AB  - Studies of experimental infection of prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) with monkeypox virus are described. After intraperitoneal infection, all of the animals died within 11 days. Virus was cultured from their blood and oropharynx several days before death; at necropsy, most of the organs tested contained monkeypox virus. Marked hepatic and splenic necrosis were observed,. along with mild inflammatory changes in the lungs. After intranasal (IN) infection, the primary pathologic changes were in the lungs and pleural cavity. Some of the IN infected animals (40%) survived, and monkeypox virus could be cultured from their nasal discharge and oropharynx for <= 22 days. Ulcerative lesions also developed on the lips, tongue, and buccal mucosa of the surviving animals. Our findings support an earlier report, which suggested that infected prairie dogs can transmit monkeypox virus by respiratory and mucocutaneous contact with susceptible animals and persons.

AB  - As a consequence of the September 2001 terrorist events, programs to protect against further such acts including potentially the use of biological warfare agents have been launched in the USA and elsewhere. As part of these initiatives, Vaccinia virus was procured for the pre-emptive vaccination of key personnel against smallpox as well as population-wide protection after an eventual exposure. The introduction of this live virus into a population at a relatively large scale represents a theoretical challenge for the safety of the blood supply, and potentially for plasma for fractionation. To strengthen further the demonstration of safety margins for plasma derived products against Vaccinia virus, the capacity of sterile filtration procedures to remove the virus was investigated. An infectivity assay for the Vaccinia virus strain which represents the majority of smallpox vaccine stocks available currently was used to investigate the potential removal of this virus by st!
 erile filtration processes during the manufacture of plasma derivatives. Vaccinia virus behaves as predicted based on its size, i.e., an artificially added virus load is removed about 10,000-fold by the sterile filtration procedures tested. As the current investigation covered a range of different protein concentrations, filter materials and filters from different manufacturers, the results obtained are considered to be widely applicable. The current investigation supports further the high safety margins of plasma derivatives against any potential Vaccinia virus content of plasma for fractionation. As the large size is a general feature of Orthopox viruses, the results would also provide assurance against poxviruses identified more recently, for example, Monkeypox virus.

AB  - Background: Human monkeypox, an emerging viral zoonosis first recognized in Africa, has recently emerged in the mid-western US. Initially, it presents with skin eruptions and fevers with diaphoresis and rigors. Clinically, the skin lesions progress from papules to vesiculopustules to resolving eschars. Methods: Three cutaneous biopsy specimens from two patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-proven monkeypox were available for review. The histologic, immunohistochemical and electron-microscopic features were identified. Results: The clinical progression of lesions is mirrored histologically with ballooning degeneration of basal keratinocytes and spongiosis of a mildly acanthotic epidermis progressing to full thickness necrosis of a markedly acanthotic epidermis containing few viable keratinocytes. A lichenoid-mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate is present, which exhibits progressive exocytosis with the keratinocyte necrosis. Inflammation of the superficial and dee!
 p vascular plexes, eccrine units and follicles is also present. Viral cytopathic effect is manifest by multinucleated syncytial keratinocytes. Immunohistochemically, viral antigen is detected within keratinocytes of the lesional epidermis, follicular and eccrine epithelium and few dermal mononuclear cells. Electron microscopy reveals virions at various stages of assembly within the keratinocyte cytoplasm. Conclusions: The histologic differential diagnosis includes herpes simplex virus, varicella and other pox viruses, such as smallpox. The first one may be differentiated histologically, immunohistochemically and electron microscopically. The last two may be differentiated using PCR assay for the monkeypox extracellular-envelope virus protein gene.

AB  - Background. In 2003, human monkeypox was first identified in the United States. The outbreak was associated with exposure to infected prairie dogs, but the potential for person-to-person transmission was a concern. This study examines health care worker (HCW) exposure to 3 patients with confirmed monkeypox. Methods. Exposed HCWs, defined as HCWs who entered a 2-m radius surrounding case patients with confirmed monkeypox, were identified by infection-control practitioners. A self-administered questionnaire and analysis of paired serum specimens determined exposure status, immune response, and postexposure signs and symptoms of monkeypox. Results. Of 81 exposed HCWs, 57 (70%) participated in the study. Among 57 participants, 40 (70%) had gtoreq1 unprotected exposure; none reported signs or symptoms consistent with monkeypox illness. One exposed HCW (2%), who had been vaccinated for smallpox within the past year, had serological evidence of recent orthopoxvirus infection;!
  acute- and convalescent-phase serum specimens tested positive for anti-orthopoxvirus IgM. No exposed HCWs had signs and symptoms consistent with monkeypox. Conclusion. More than three-quarters of exposed HCWs reported at least 1 unprotected encounter with a patient who had monkeypox. One asymptomatic HCW showed laboratory evidence of recent orthopoxvirus infection, which was possibly attributable to either recent infection or smallpox vaccination. Transmission of monkeypox likely is a rare event in the health care setting.

AB  - A method for one-stage rapid identification of four orthopoxvirus species pathogenic to humans based on multiplex polymerase chain reaction (MPCR) was developed. Five pairs of oligonucleotide primers-one. genus-specific and the rest, species-specific for variola. monkeypox, cowpox, and vaccinia viruses, respectively-were used Concurrently for MPCR assay of orthopoxvirus DNAs. Specificity and sensitivity of the method developed were evaluated using DNAs of 57 orthopoxvirus strains, including the DNAs isolated from human case clinical materials. Copyright 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Poxvirus Bioinformatics Resource Center (PBRC) has been established to provide informational and analytical resources to the scientific community to aid research directed at providing a better understanding of the Poxviridae family of viruses. The PBRC was specifically established as the result of the concern that variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, as well as related viruses, might be utilized as biological weapons. In addition, the PBRC supports research on poxviruses that might be considered new and emerging infectious agents such as monkeypox virus. The PBRC consists of a relational database and web application that supports the data storage, annotation, analysis and information exchange goals of the project. The current release consists of over 35 complete genomic sequences of various genera, species and strains of viruses from the Poxviridae family. Sequence and annotation information for these viruses has been obtained from sequences publicly ava!
 ilable from GenBank as well as sequences not yet deposited in GenBank that have been obtained from ongoing sequencing projects. In addition to sequence data, the PBRC provides comprehensive annotation and curation of virus genes; analytical tools to aid in the understanding of the available sequence data, including tools for the comparative analysis of different virus isolates; and visualization tools to help better display the results of various analyses. The PBRC represents the initial development of what will become a more comprehensive Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center for Biodefense that will be one of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases' 'Bioinformatics Resource Centers for Biodefense and Emerging or Re-Emerging Infectious Diseases'. The PBRC website is available at http://www.poxvirus.org.

AB  - Exotic pets, including hedgehogs, have become popular in recent years among pet owners, especially in North America. Such animals can carry and introduce zoonotic agents, a fact well illustrated by the recent outbreak of monkeypox in pet prairie dogs. We reviewed known and potential zoonotic diseases that could be carried and transmitted by pet hedgehogs or by wild-caught hedgehogs that have been rescued.

AB  - It is unknown whether smallpox vaccination would protect human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected individuals, because helper CD4+ cells, the targets of HIV-1 infection, are necessary for the induction of both adaptive CD8+ cell and B cell responses. We have addressed this question in macaques and have demonstrated that, although smallpox vaccination is safe in immunodeficient macaques when it is preceded by immunization with highly attenuated vaccinia strains, the macaques were not protected against lethal monkeypox virus challenge if their CD4+ cell count was 300 cells/mm3. The lack of protection appeared to be associated with a defect in vaccinia-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) switching from IgM to IgG. Thus, vaccination strategies that bypass CD4+ cell help are needed to elicit IgG antibodies with high affinity and adequate tissue distribution and to restore protection against smallpox in severely immunocompromised individuals.

AB  - The demand for nonhuman primates will undoubtedly increase to meet biomedical needs in this current age of biodefense. The availability of funding has increased the research on select agents and has created a requirement to validate results in relevant primate models. This review provides a description of current and potential biological threats that are likely to require nonhuman primates for the development of vaccines and therapeutics. Primates have been an invaluable resource in the dissection of viral disease pathogenesis as well as in testing vaccine efficacy. DNA vaccine approaches have been studied successfully for Ebola, Lassa, and anthrax in nonhuman primate models. Nonhuman primate research with monkeypox has provided insight into the role of cytokines in limiting disease severity. Biodefense research that has focused on select agents of bacterial origin has also benefited from nonhuman primate studies. Rhesus macaques have traditionally been the model of ch!
 oice for anthrax research and have yielded successful findings in vaccine development. In plague research, African green monkeys have contributed to vaccine development. However, the disadvantages of current vaccines will undoubtedly require the generation of new vaccines, thus increasing the need for nonhuman primate research. Unfortunately, the current biosafety level (BSL)-3 and BSL-4 facilities equipped to perform this research are limited, which may ultimately impede progress in this era of biodefense.

AB  - The migration of people and the transport of animals beyond their natural environment result in the more and more frequent transfer of some diseases from one continent to another, outside epidemic areas. The last epidemic among people of an illness caused by an animal virus is eighty one cases of monkeypox noted in the United States up until June of 2003. This is the first case of the epidemic of this sickness observed in the northern hemisphere. Most cases of the disease occurred after patients had been bitten or scratched by pet prairie dogs, commonly kept in American homes. It has been proved that the animals became infected from imported Ghana rodents, African rats that constitute a natural reservoir of the microbe.

AB  - September 11, 2001 demonstrated dramatic voids in national preparedness, and catalyzed massive efforts to identify and remedy vulnerabilities. Since Part I of this series appeared in August 2002, significant improvements have been achieved especially in bioterrorism and chemical terrorism for first responders and emergency medicine, law enforcement, and public health (surveillance). Such efforts manifested benefits during the SARS outbreaks and monkeypox cases of 2003. Nevertheless, emerging infectious diseases will continue to pose a threat if we do not remain vigilant and continue to invest in training, surveillance, and treatments. As expected, many poison centers and toxicologists have taken leadership roles nationwide. In regions where such leadership existed, preparedness levels are strong and collaborations resulted in the development of valuable response plans and training, including the Advanced Hazardous Life Support (AHLS) and Basic Disaster Life Support (BD!
 LS) courses. Early success notwithstanding, experts suggest that current national preparedness has improved slightly from "'1" (9/11) to "3'' out of "10". Increasingly it has become evident that the nuclear threat, including radiation terrorism, is significant, against which the US remains inadequately prepared. Arguably the nuclear threat-whether accidental or planned-remains our highest consequence vulnerability, and we must rapidly improve our readiness across disciplines. Special populations including the elderly and children remain marginalized in preparedness protocols. Local vulnerabilities including chemical manufacturing and transportation - not just a risk for terrorism but industrial accidents - continue unabated. Our early success is not an endpoint; much work remains and time is fleeting. This report examines vulnerabilities that must be addressed to enhance preparedness.

AB  - Background. The outbreak of monkeypox in the Midwestern United States during June 2003 marks the first documented human infection in the Western Hemisphere. Consistent with those in outbreaks in Africa, most cases in this outbreak were associated with febrile rash illness. We describe a cluster of monkeypox in a family with a spectrum of clinical illness, including encephalitis, and outline the laboratory confirmation of monkeypox. Methods. Standardized patient information was collected by questionnaire and medical chart review; all cases described were laboratory confirmed. Laboratory methods included nucleic acid detection, viral culture, serologic testing, histopathologic evaluation, and immunohistochemical testing. Results. Of 3 family members with monkeypox, 2 had rash illness only, and 1 required hospitalization for severe encephalitis. The family member with the mildest clinical course had previously received smallpox vaccination. Diagnostic testing by both poly!
 merase chain reaction and culture revealed infectious monkeypox virus in skin lesions of all 3 patients; 2 patients had orthopoxvirus detected by immunohistochemistry in skin lesions. The patient with encephalitis had orthopoxvirus-reactive immunoglobulin M (IgM) in cerebrospinal fluid. All patients had detectable IgM responses to orthopoxvirus antigens. Conclusions. These 3 patients illustrate a spectrum of clinical illness with monkeypox despite a common source of exposure; manifestation and severity of illness may be affected by age and prior smallpox vaccination. We report that monkeypox, in addition to causing febrile rash illness, causes severe neurologic infection, and we discuss the use of novel laboratory tests for its diagnosis.

AB  - A proposed new small-animal (rodent) model for studying the pathogenesis and treatment of severe orthopoxvirus infections is described. Thirteen-lined ground squirrels (Spermophilus tridecemlineatus) were infected intraperitoneally and intranasally with monkeypox virus (MPXV). A fulminant illness developed in all animals, and they died 6-9 days after infection. Virus was cultured from the blood and oropharynx several days before death; at necropsy, all of the organs tested contained relatively high titers of MPXV. The major pathologic findings were in the liver, which showed centrilobular necrosis, steatosis, and basophilic inclusion bodies in hepatocytes. Splenic necrosis was also observed, as well as interstitial inflammation in the lungs. The pathologic features of MPXV in ground squirrels are similar to that described with MPXV in macaques and severe variola (smallpox) virus infection in humans.

AB  - During the summer of 2003, an outbreak of human monkeypox occurred in the Midwest region of the United States. In all, 52 rodents suspected of being infected with monkeypox virus were collected from an exotic pet dealer and from private homes. The rodents were euthanized and submitted for testing to the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases by the Galesburg Animal Disease Laboratory, Illinois Department of Agriculture. The rodent tissue samples were appropriately processed and then tested by using an integrated approach involving real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, an antigen-detection immunoassay, and virus culture. We designed and extensively tested two specific real-time PCR assays for rapidly detecting monkeypox virus DNA using the Vaccinia virus F3L and N3R genes as targets. The assays were validated against panels of orthopox viral and miscellaneous bacterial DNAs. A pan-orthopox electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay wa!
 s used to further confirm the presence of Orthopoxvirus infection of the rodents. Seven of 12 (58%) animals (seven of 52 (15%) of all animals) tested positive in both monkeypox-specific PCR assays and two additional pan-orthopox PCR assays (in at least one tissue). The ECL results showed varying degrees of agreement with PCR. One hamster and three gerbils were positive by both PCR and ECL for all tissues tested. In addition, we attempted to verify the presence of monkeypox virus by culture on multiple cell lines, by immunohistology, and by electron microscopy, with negative results. Sequencing the PCR products from the samples indicated 100% identity with monkeypox virus strain Zaire-96-I-16 (a human isolate from the Congo). These real-time PCR and ECL assays represent a significant addition to the battery of tests for the detection of various orthopoxviruses. In light of the recent monkeypox virus transmissions, early detection of the virus is crucial for both natural outb!
 reaks and potential acts of bioterrorism.

AB  - Orthopoxviruses, including smallpox, monkeypox and molluscipox, pose risks to human health through bioterrorist acts or natural transmission. There is no approved therapy for orthopoxvirus infections; however, cidofovir (CDV) has been approved as an investigational new drug for emergency treatment of adverse effects following smallpox vaccination. For evaluation of new therapies directed against orthopoxvirus infections, we have utilized immunocompetent, hairless mice (SKH-1) inoculated by a cutaneous route with cowpox virus (CV) or vaccinia virus (W). Mice subsequently developed skin lesions and virus was recovered from the site of inoculation and quantified. Skin biopsies were evaluated microscopically, revealing brick-like eosinophilic, intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies characteristic of orthopoxvirus infection. SKH-1 mice fully recovered from either CV or VV infection. Immunodeficient Athymic or Rhino mice inoculated with CV or VV had more lesions and severe diseas!
 e than SKH-1 mice. CV-infected SKH-1 mice were treated either with systemic or topical CDV. Although some protection was achieved with systemic treatment, 5% topical CDV was most effective at reducing virus titers in skin, lung, kidney, and spleen. These models may provide a means for evaluating efficacy of new therapies directed against orthopoxvirus diseases and further confirm the topical activity of CDV against cutaneous infections.

AB  - Background: The limited circulation of many of the agents that are likely to be used in a bioterrorism attack precludes the ready availability of positive controls. This means that only specialized laboratories can screen for the presence of these agents by nucleic amplification assays. Calibrated controls are also necessary for quantitative measurements. Primers and probes to be used in both conventional and real-time PCR assays were designed for the detection of agents likely to be used by a bioterrorist. Three plasmids, each of which contains 4 to 6 specific sequences from agents on the CDC Category A and B list (excluding RNA viruses) were constructed. Two plasmids incorporate the sequences of Category A and B agents, respectively. The third plasmid incorporates sequences from Variola major and organisms that cause rash-like illnesses that may be clinically confused with smallpox. An "exogenic sequence", introducing a NotI restriction site was incorporated in the n!
 ative sequences of the bioterrorism agents inserted in plasmids. The designed molecular system for detection of bioterrorism agents was tested on each of these agents (except Monkeypox virus, Smallpox virus and 2 Burkholderia species for which no native DNA was available) and a collection of 50 isolates of C. burnetii using constructed plasmids as positive controls. Results: Designed primers and probes allowed molecular detection, in either single or multiplex assays, of agent-specific targets with analytical sensitivities of between 1 and 100 DNA copies. The plasmids could be used as positive controls. False-positive results due to contamination by the positive control were easily detected by sequencing and eliminated by digestion with NotI. Conclusion: Plasmid A and B can be used as positive controls in molecular assays for the detection of bioterrorism agents in clinical specimens or environmental samples. Plasmid C can be used as a positive control in differentiation of!
  vesicular rashes. It is also possible to avoid or to ensure i!
 mmediate
 detection of false positive results due to contamination by positive controls using these plasmids. These plasmids and the corresponding primers and probes are immediately available for all clinical microbiology laboratories provided they have molecular amplification equipment.

AB  - Two decades after a worldwide vaccination campaign was used to successfully eradicate naturally occurring smallpox, the threat of bioterrorism has led to renewed vaccination programs. In addition, sporadic outbreaks of human monkeypox in Africa and a recent outbreak of human monkeypox in the U.S. have made it clear that naturally occurring zoonotic orthopoxvirus diseases remain a public health concern. Much of the threat posed by orthopoxviruses could be eliminated by vaccination; however, because the smallpox vaccine is a live orthopoxvirus vaccine (vaccinia virus) administered to the skin, the vaccine itself can pose a serious health risk. Here, we demonstrate that rhesus macaques vaccinated with a DNA vaccine consisting of four vaccinia virus genes (L1R, A27L, A33R, and B5R) were protected from severe disease after an otherwise lethal challenge with monkeypox virus. Animals vaccinated with a single gene (L1R) which encodes a target of neutralizing antibodies develop!
 ed severe disease but survived. This is the first demonstration that a subunit vaccine approach to smallpox-monkeypox immunization is feasible.

AB  - Nucleoside analogs were investigated for their potential to inhibit cowpox virus (a surrogate for variola and monkeypox viruses) in cell culture and in lethal respiratory infections in mice. Cell culture antiviral activity was determined by plaque reduction assays, with cytotoxicity determined by cell proliferation assays. Selectivity indices (SI's, 50% cytotoxic concentration divided by 50% virus-inhibitory concentration) were determined for 15 compounds. Three arabinofuranosyl (Ara) nucleosides showed activity in mouse mammary tumor (C127I) cells: guanine (Ara-G), thymine (Ara-T), and adenine (Ara-A) with SI's of 113, 61, and 95, respectively. The 2'-fluoro-Ara nucleosides of 5-F-cytosine (FIAC), 5-methyluracil (FMAU), and 5-iodouracil (FIAU) exhibited SI's of 148, 77, and 29, respectively. Other potent compounds included cidofovir (a positive control) and 3'-O-methyladenosine, with SI values of 164 and 56, respectively. In general, assays performed in African green !
 monkey kidney (Vero) cells produced lower SI's than in C127I cells, except for 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine (IDU) which had an SI of > 71 in Vero cells and 3.1 in C127I cells. Intranasal infection of mice with cowpox virus was followed a day later by twice daily intraperitoneal treatment with compounds for 5 days. Ara-A was active at 300 mg/kg/day (40% survival), FMAU at 100 mg/kg/day (70% survival), and cidofovir (given for 1 day only) at 100 mg/kg (80-100% survival). None of the other compounds, including IDU, prevented death nor delayed the time to death. Cidofovir had the best potential for treating orthopoxvirus infections of those tested.

AB  - (+-)-1-Deazaaristeromycin (4) has been reported to be an inactivator of S-adenosyhomocysteine (AdoHcy) hydrolase and, as a consequence, to affect S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) mediated macromolecular biomethylations. To extend this to our program focused on 5'-noraristeromycin derivatives as inhibitors of the same hydrolase enzyme as potential antiviral agents, both enantiomers of 1-deaza-5'-noraristeromycin (5 and 20) have been prepared. Compounds 5 and 20 were evaluated against the following viruses: vaccinia, cowpox, monkeypox, Ebola, herpes simplex type 1 and 2, human cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr, varicella zoster, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV-1 and HIV-2, adenovirus type 1, measles, Pichinde, parainfluenza type 3, influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2), influenza B, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, rhinovirus type 2, respiratory syncytial, yellow fever, and West Nile. No activity was found nor was there any cytotoxicity to the viral host cells.

AB  - During May and June 2003, the first cluster of human monkeypox cases in the United States was reported. Most patients with this febrile vesicular rash illness presumably acquired the infection from prairie dogs. Monkeypox virus was demonstrated by using polymerase chain reaction in two prairie dogs in which pathologic studies showed necrotizing bronchopneumonia, conjunctivitis, and tongue ulceration. Immunohistochemical assays for orthopoxviruses demonstrated abundant viral antigens in surface epithelial cells of lesions in conjunctivae and tongue, with lower amounts in adjacent macrophages, fibroblasts, and connective tissues. Viral antigens in the lung were abundant in bronchial epithelial cells, macrophages, and fibroblasts. Virus isolation and electron microscopy demonstrated active viral replication in lungs and tongue. These findings indicate that both respiratory and direct mucocutaneous exposures are potentially important routes of transmission of monkeypox vir!
 us between rodents and to humans. Prairie dogs offer insights into transmission, pathogenesis, and new vaccine and treatment trials because they are susceptible to severe monkeypox infection.

AB  - The potential use of smallpox as a biological weapon has led to the production and stockpiling of smallpox vaccine and the immunization of some healthcare workers. Another public health goal is the licensing of a safer vaccine that could benefit the millions of people advised not to take the current one because they or their contacts have increased susceptibility to severe vaccine side effects. As vaccines can no longer be tested for their ability to prevent smallpox, licensing will necessarily include comparative immunogenicity and protection studies in non-human primates. Here we compare the highly attenuated modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) with the licensed Dryvax vaccine in a monkey model. After two doses of MVA or one dose of MVA followed by Dryvax, antibody binding and neutralizing titres and T-cell responses were equivalent or higher than those induced by Dryvax alone. After challenge with monkeypox virus, unimmunized animals developed more than 500 pustula!
 r skin lesions and became gravely ill or died, whereas vaccinated animals were healthy and asymptomatic, except for a small number of transient skin lesions in animals immunized only with MVA.

AB  - The evolutionary relationships of 26 sequenced members of the poxvirus family have been investigated by comparing their genome organization and gene content and by using DNA and protein sequences for phylogenetic analyses. The central region of the genome of chordopoxviruses (ChPVs) is highly conserved in gene content and arrangement, except for some gene inversions in Fowlpox virus (FPV) and species-specific gene insertions in FPV and Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV). In the central region 90 genes are conserved in all ChPVs, but no gene from near the termini is conserved throughout the subfamily. Inclusion of two entomopoxvirus (EnPV) sequences reduces the number of conserved genes to 49. The EnPVs are divergent from ChPVs and between themselves. Relationships between ChPV genera were evaluated by comparing the genome size, number of unique genes, gene arrangement and phylogenetic analyses of protein sequences. Overall, genus Avipoxvirus is the most divergent. The n!
 ext most divergent ChPV genus is Molluscipoxvirus, whose sole member, MCV, infects only man. The Suipoxvirus, Capripoxvirus, Leporipoxvirus and Yetapoxvirus genera cluster together, with Suipoxvirus and Capripoxvirus sharing a common ancestor, and are distinct from the genus Orthopoxvirus (OPV). Within the OPV genus, Monkeypox virus, Ectromelia virus and Cowpox virus strain Brighton Red (BR) do not group closely with any other OPV, Variola virus and Camelpox virus form a subgroup, and Vaccinia virus is most closely related to CPV-GRI-90. This suggests that CPV-BR and GRI-90 should be separate species.

AB  - Monkeypox virus disease is a rare zoonosis that until recently was limited to Central Africa. We describe the clinical features of the third child in the United States reported with this newly emerging infection. This child was part of a large cluster of individuals in the Midwest infected by prairie dogs that had contracted the virus when housed with infected small mammals imported from Africa. The differential and laboratory diagnoses and the difficulty finding physicians and nurses to care for this patient are discussed.

AB  - Highly efficient and practical methodology for the syntheses of D- and L-4,5-O-isopropylidene-2-cyclopentenone (9 and 22), versatile intermediates for the synthesis of carbocyclic nucleosides, have been developed via a ring-closing metathesis reaction from D-ribose in eight steps. The utility of D- and L-4,5-O-isopropylidene-2-cyclopentenone is demonstrated by their application for the preparation of D-cyclopentyl-6-azauridine 12 and D-cyclopentenyl-5-halocytosine nucleosides (33-35) using Mitsunobu reaction to introduce pyrimidine bases as potential antiviral agents. Preliminary antiviral activity against orthopox viruses (smallpox, monkeypox, and cowpox virus) of the synthesized nucleosides are described.

AB  - BACKGROUND During May and June 2003, an outbreak of febrile illness with vesiculopustular eruptions occurred among persons in the midwestern United States who had had contact with ill pet prairie dogs obtained through a common distributor. Zoonotic transmission of a bacterial or viral pathogen was suspected. METHODS We reviewed medical records, conducted interviews and examinations, and collected blood and tissue samples for analysis from 11 patients and one prairie dog. Histopathological and electron-microscopical examinations, microbiologic cultures, and molecular assays were performed to identify the etiologic agent RESULTS The initial Wisconsin cases evaluated in this outbreak occurred in five males and six females ranging in age from 3 to 43 years. All patients reported having direct contact with ill prairie dogs before experiencing a febrile illness with skin eruptions. We found immunohistochemical or ultrastructural evidence of poxvirus infection in skin-lesion !
 tissue from four patients. Monkeypox virus was recovered in cell cultures of seven samples from patients and from the prairie dog. The virus was identified by detection of monkey-pox-specific DNA sequences in tissues or isolates from six patients and the prairie dog. Epidemiologic investigation suggested that the prairie dogs had been exposed to at least one species of rodent recently imported into the United States from West Africa. CONCLUSIONS Our investigation documents the isolation and identification of monkeypox virus from humans in the Western Hemisphere. Infection of humans was associated with direct contact with ill prairie dogs that were being kept or sold as pets.

AB  - It is unclear when, where and how novel pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), monkeypox and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) will cross the barriers that separate their natural reservoirs from human populations and ignite the epidemic spread of novel infectious diseases. New pathogens are believed to emerge from animal reservoirs when ecological changes increase the pathogen's opportunities to enter the human population and to generate subsequent human-to-human transmission. Effective human-to-human transmission requires that the pathogen's basic reproductive number, R0, should exceed one, where R0 is the average number of secondary infections arising from one infected individual in a completely susceptible population. However, an increase in R0, even when insufficient to generate an epidemic, nonetheless increases the number of subsequently infected individuals. Here we show that, as a consequence of this, the probability of pathogen evolution !
 to R0>1 and subsequent disease emergence can increase markedly.

AB  - During the past year, the public has become keenly aware of the threat of emerging infectious diseases with the global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the continuing threat of bioterrorism, the proliferation of West Nile virus, and the discovery of human cases of monkeypox in the United States. At the same time, an old foe has again raised its head, reminding us that our worst nightmare may not be a new one. In 2003, highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza virus, including the H5N1 and H7N7 subtypes, again crossed from birds to humans and caused fatal disease. Direct avian-to-human influenza transmission was unknown before 1997. Have we responded to these threats by better preparing for emerging disease agents, or are we continuing to act only as crises arise? Here we consider progress to date in preparedness for an influenza pandemic and review what remains to be done. We conclude by prioritizing the remaining needs and exploring the reasons f!
 or our current lack of preparedness for an influenza pandemic.

AB  - Background: Early detection of orthopoxvirus infection is critical to medical and public health management. Variola encodes the smallpox inhibitor of complement enzymes (SPICE), a complement regulatory protein that is homologous to the vaccinia virus complement control protein (VCP). Both SPICE and VCP are functionally similar to the family of mammalian complement regulatory proteins (CRPs), which inhibit complement and prevent inadvertent injury to bystander cells and tissues during complement activation. While VCP and SPICE are 95.6% identical, SPICE is 100-fold more potent than VCP at inhibiting human C3b and more human complement specific. Methods: A rapid and sensitive PCR assay was developed using consensus sequences to amplify different fragments of SPICE or VCP in plasma. Results: The most sensitive primer set led to a detection of 10 pfu/mul of vaccinia in mouse plasma samples. Vaccinia infection in BALB/c was detectable in the plasma 2 days p.i. following i.d!
 . inoculation with 5X107 pfu in the hind footpads. This assay demonstrates for the first time that viremia occurs after i.d. injection of vaccinia. In addition, DNA sequence analysis reveals that all variola strains contain an SspI site at bp 681-686 of SPICE that can be used to identify a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). This RFLP can be used to differentiate variola from other orthopoxviruses since VCP and homologous proteins in cowpox, ectromelia, and camelpox lack the SspI site; Monkeypox species have a truncated CRP gene that also lack the SspI site. To confirm the RFLP results agreed with the DNA sequence prediction, plasmids containing SPICE and VCP were subjected to fragment amplification and SspI digestion. The SPICE amplicon was digested by SspI, while the VCP amplicon was not. Conclusions: The PCR-RFLP assay can detect and differentiate vaccinia and variola in plasma samples. This may be used to differentiate smallpox infection from symptomatic co!
 mplications of vaccinia.

AB  - Bioterrorist attacks occupy a special place amongst the innumerable potential types of terrorist attack, with the intentional release of pox viruses being especially feared in this connection. Apart from the variola virus, the agent responsible for smallpox in humans, the monkeypox virus and numerous other animal pox viruses pose potential risks for humans and animals. This risk scenario also includes recombinations between the various pox viruses, changes in hosts and genetically engineered manipulations of pox viruses. For over 200 years, the method of choice for combatting smallpox was via vaccination with a reproductive, original vaccinia virus. Worldwide eradication of smallpox at the end of the 1970s and the discontinuation of routine smallpox vaccination in 1980 can be credited to such vaccination. Unfortunately, these vaccinations were associated with a large number of postvaccinal impairments, sometimes resulting in death (e.g. postvaccinal encephalitis). The !
 only way to restrict such postvaccinal complications was to carry out initial vaccination within the first 2 postnatal years. Initial vaccination at a later age led to such a sharp increase in the number of vaccines with complications that vaccination had to be discouraged. The dilemma of the smallpox vaccine stocks stems from the fact that a large portion of these stocks are produced with the same vaccinia strains as before. This is irresponsible, especially as the percentage of immune-suppressed persons in the population, for whom vaccination-related complications pose an especial threat, is increasing. One solution to the dilemma of the smallpox vaccine stocks is the MVA strain. It is harmless, protects humans and animals equally well against smallpox and can be applied parenterally.

AB  - Variola virus (VARV), causing smallpox, is a potential biological weapon. Methods to detect VARV rapidly and to differentiate it from other viruses causing similar clinical syndromes are needed urgently. We have developed a new microarray-based method that detects simultaneously and discriminates four orthopoxvirus (OPV) species pathogenic for humans (variola, monkeypox, cowpox, and vaccinia viruses) and distinguishes them from chickenpox virus (varicella-zoster virus or VZV). The OPV gene C23L/B29R, encoding the CC-chemokine binding protein, was sequenced for 41 strains of seven species of orthopox viruses obtained from different geographical regions. Those C23L/B29R sequences and the ORF 62 sequences from 13 strains of VZV (selected from GenBank) were used to design oligonucleotide probes that were immobilized on an aldehyde-coated glass surface (a total of 57 probes). The microchip contained several unique 13-21 bases long oligonucleotide probes specific to each vir!
 us species to ensure redundancy and robustness of the assay. A region approximately 1100 bases long was amplified from samples of viral DNA and fluorescently labeled with Cy5-modified dNTPs, and single-stranded DNA was prepared by strand separation. Hybridization was carried out under plastic coverslips, resulting in a fluorescent pattern that was quantified using a confocal laser scanner. 49 known and blinded samples of OPV DNA, representing different OPV species, and two VZV strains were tested. The oligonucleotide microarray hybridization technique identified reliably and correctly all samples. This new procedure takes only 3 h, and it can be used for parallel testing of multiple samples.

AB  - Although smallpox has been eradicated from the world, its causative agent, variola virus, is still considered a potential threat agent for bioterrorism. Within the orthopox virus genus (family: Poxviridae, subfamily: Chordopoxviridae), variola, vaccinia, cowpox and monkeypox viruses are the main agents causing human infections. Recombinant technology and remarkable progress in the understanding of Orthopox virus replication increase the potential for bioterrorists to use these large viruses to produce a new recombinant threat agent. To rapidly detect orthopoxvirus DNA, a LightCycler PCR real-time probe hydrolysis assay was designed to detect known orthopoxvirus hemagglutinin gene sequences. The assay detected DNA from five vaccinia virus strains, rabbitpox virus, racoonpox virus, and a plasmid containing the variola hemagglutinin gene, but it did not detect the viral DNA of herpes simplex, varicella-zoster, or adeno viruses. The analytical sensitivity assay on the DNA !
 of cultured vaccina virus spiked in blood showed this assay could detect 1 pfu per reaction vessel and showed no significant difference from the virus spiked in PBS. The analytical sensitivity of the assay to detect the plasmid DNA containing variola hemagglutinin gene was shown to be at 100 ag per reaction. The assay was specific for all orthopox viruses tested to date. Further test using genomic DNA from cowpox and monkeypox viruses and diffrentiaton from viruses of other genera is ongoing to confirm the Othopoxvirus genus specificity of this probe hydrolysis set in LightCycler PCR.

AB  - Orthopoxviruses, including variola and monkeypox, pose risks to human health through natural transmission or potential bioterrorist activities. Since vaccination has not recently been utilized for control of these infections, there is renewed effort in the development of antiviral agents not only for postexposure smallpox therapy but also for treatment of adverse reactions following vaccination. The objectives of this study were to expand on the results of others that cidofovir (CDV) is effective in mice inoculated with cowpox virus (CV) or vaccinia virus (VV) and to document the efficacy of single and interval dosing beginning prior to or after infection, particularly including evaluations using suboptimal doses of CDV. We utilized BALB/c or SCID mice inoculated with CV or VV as models for systemic poxvirus infections. BALB/c mice were inoculated intranasally with CV or VV and treated with CDV prior to or after virus inoculation. CDV, at concentrations as low as 0.7 t!
 o 6.7 mg/kg of body weight/day for 5 days, conferred significant protection when treatment was initiated as late as 72 to 96 h postinfection. A single-dose pretreatment or posttreatment with CDV at 3 to 100 mg/kg was effective when given as early as 5 days prior to infection or as late as 3 days after infection with either VV or CV. Interval treatments given every third day beginning 72 h postinfection using 6.7 or 2 mg of CDV/kg also proved effective against CV infections. When SCID mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with CV or VV and treated for 7 to 30 days with CDV, all the mice eventually died during or after cessation of treatment; however, significant delays in time to death and reduction of virus replication in organs occurred in most treated groups, and no resistance to CDV was detected.

AB  - Background: Cidofovir is approved for the treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis in humans. Although highly effective, the drug can cause renal toxicity in patients. There is much interest in cidofovir as a potential treatment for smallpox, monkeypox and other orthopoxvirus infections. A cyclic phosphonate form of cidofovir, 1-(((S)-2-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,4,2-dioxaphosphorinan-5-yl)-methyl)cytosine (cyclic HPMPC), was reported to be less nephrotoxic than cidofovir in animals. Thus, it was deemed important to directly compare the activities of cidofovir and cyclic HPMPC against poxvirus infections in mouse models. Methods: The compounds were evaluated by intraperitoneal and intranasal infection routes using multiple doses of each agent, with single doses of compound given 24 h after virus challenge. Results: By intraperitoneal route, cidofovir protected mice from mortality at 40, 80 and 160 mg/kg, whereas cyclic HPMPC was similarly protective only at 160 mg/kg. By intranasal!
  route, cidofovir was active down to 5 mg/kg, compared to cyclic HPMPC efficacy at 20 and 40 mg/kg. Intraperitoneal doses of 40, 80 and 160 mg/kg cidofovir significantly reduced mortality from vaccinia virus infections, compared to doses of 80 and 160 mg/kg cyclic HPMPC. Intranasal treatment with cidofovir at 5-40 mg/kg was comparably effective to cyclic HPMPC doses of 20 and 40 mg/kg in vaccinia virus infections. Active doses significantly reduced lung virus titers and lung consolidation. Overall, the potency of cyclic HPMPC was about 4 times less than that of cidofovir. Conclusions: Although cyclic HPMPC is reported to exhibit reduced nephrotoxicity in vivo, it is also less potent than cidofovir against orthopoxvirus infections. For this reason, cyclic HPMPC may not offer any advantage over cidofovir in treating these infections in humans.

AB  - The review considers recent data on the structural-functional organization of the genome of orthopoxviruses pathogenic for humans, including the variola, monkeypox, cowpox, and vaccinia viruses. Emphasis was placed on the structure of molecular virulence factors that suppress the inflammatory reactions, immune response, and interferon effects induced by virus infection.

AB  - Several animal models using mice (most frequently), rabbits, or monkeys have been used to identify compounds active against orthopoxvirus infections. The treatment of vaccinia virus infections has been well studied in models involving infection of scarified skin or eyes, or resulting from intravenous, intraperitoneal, intracerebral, or intranasal virus inoculation. Cowpox virus has been used in intranasal or aerosol infection studies to evaluate the treatment of lethal respiratory infections. Rabbitpox, monkeypox, and variola viruses have been employed to a lesser extent than the other viruses in chemotherapy experiments. A review of the literature over the past 50 years has identified a number of compounds effective in treating one or more of these infections, which include thiosemicarbazones, nucleoside and nucleotide analogs, interferon, interferon inducers, and other unrelated compounds. Substances that appear to have the greatest potential as anti-orthopoxvirus ag!
 ents are the acyclic nucleotides, (S)-1-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)cytosine (cidofovir, HPMPC) and 1-(((S)-2-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,4,2-dioxaphosphorinan-5-yl)methyl)cytosine (cyclic HPMPC), and the acyclic nucleoside analog, 2-amino-7-((1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxy)methyl)purine (S2242). Other classes of compounds that have not been sufficiently studied in lethal infection models and deserve further consideration are thiosemicarbazones related to methisazone, and analogs of adenosine-N1-oxide and 1-(benzyloxy)adenosine.

AB  - The potential use of variola or another orthopoxvirus such as monkeypox as a weapon of bioterrorism has stimulated efforts to develop new drugs for treatment of smallpox or other poxvirus infections. At the present time only cidofovir is approved for use in the emergency treatment of smallpox outbreaks. Although cidofovir is very active against the orthopoxviruses in vitro and in animal model infections, it is not active when given orally and must be administered with precaution so as to avoid renal toxicity. In an attempt to identify alternative treatment modalities for these infections we have determined the anti-poxvirus activity in vitro of most of the approved antiviral agents as well as a number of cidofovir analogs and prodrugs. From these studies, we have identified the nucleotide analog, adefovir dipivoxil, some alkoxyalkyl esters of cidofovir and a number of prodrugs of cidofovir that warrant further investigation as potential therapies for smallpox or other !
 orthopoxvirus infections.

AB  - We assessed the activities of 24 different antiviral compounds against smallpox (two strains of variola major and one of variola minor), monkeypox, vaccinia and cowpox viruses by a neutral red uptake assay. To establish assay parameters, we examined viral replication and its inhibition at various times postinfection and at several multiplicities of infection. Drugs were selected to target a range of functions involved in viral replication. Eight compounds (cidofovir, cyclic HPMPC (cHPMPC), HPMPA, ribavirin, tiazofurin, carbocyclic 3-deazaadenosine, 3-deazaneplanocin A and DFBA (1-(2,4-difluorobenzyloxy)adenosine perchlorate)-a derivative of adenosine N1-oxide) inhibited the replication of all three variola strains and the other orthopoxviruses at drug concentrations within a pharmacologically achievable range. Two others (methisazone and bis-POM-PMEA) showed a lesser degree of antiviral effect, while the remainder were inactive. To examine possible naturally occurring !
 drug resistance among a large number of variola isolates obtained from different geographical regions and at different times, we examined the sensitivity of 35 different strains of variola as well as other orthopoxviruses to a subset of three of the most active compounds: cidofovir, cHPMPC, and ribavirin. Preliminary data indicate that nearly all isolates appear to have similar drug sensitivities. These findings are currently being verified and expanded.

AB  - Two major infectious forms of vaccinia virus (VACV) have been described: the intracellular mature virion (IMV), and the extracellular enveloped virion (EEV). Due to their stability in the environment, IMVs play a predominant role in host-to-host transmission, whereas EEVs play an important role in dissemination within the host. In a previous report, we demonstrated that mice vaccinated with VACV L1R (IMV immunogen) and A33R (EEV immunogen) were protected from a lethal poxvirus challenge. Vaccination with a combination of both genes conferred greater protection than either gene alone, suggesting that an immune response against both IMV and EEV is advantageous. Here, we report that in mice individually administered DNA vaccines with two different VACV immunogens, A27L (IMV immunogen) or B5R (EEV immunogen), failed to significantly protect; however, vaccination with a combination of both genes conferred a high level of protection. Mice were completely protected when vacci!
 nated with a combination of four VACV genes (A27L+A33R+L1R+B5R). Rhesus macaques vaccinated with this four-gene-combination developed appropriate antibody responses to each protein. Antibody responses elicited by this vaccine cross-reacted with monkeypox virus orthologous proteins. These data indicate that a gene-based vaccine comprised of the VACV A27L+A33R+L1R+B5R genes may be a useful candidate to protect against other orthopoxviruses, including those that cause monkeypox and smallpox.

AB  - An improved method for the synthesis of enantiomerically pure D-cyclopentenyl nucleosides has been accomplished and their antiviral activity against orthopox viruses have been evaluated. The key intermediate, L-cyclopent-2-enone 13 was prepared from D-ribose using a ring closing metathesis reaction in eight steps. Among the synthesized nucleosides, the adenine 2 (Neplanocin A), cytosine 14, and 5-F-cytosine 15 analogues exhibited potent anti-orthopox virus activity, including smallpox virus.

AB  - Although it is often stated that only vaccination would be able to contain or protect the population against a catastrophic smallpox outbreak, the acyclic nucleoside phosphonate analog cidofovir offers a valuable alternative for the therapy and short-term pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis, not only of smallpox but also of other poxvirus infections and DNA viruses. Cidofovir has proven effective against vaccinia, cowpox and monkeypox in various animal model infections. In cell culture, cidofovir has demonstrated activity against variola virus, the etiological agent of smallpox, and in patients it has shown marked efficacy against molluscum contagiosum and orf, two poxvirus infections. Cidofovir is available as an aqueous solution for intravenous administration and could be reformulated for topical (cream or gel), intranasal (aerosol) or peroral (as a lipid prodrug) use, should the need arise.

AB  - The orthopoxvirus gene p4c has been identified in the genome of the vaccinia virus strain Western Reserve. This gene encodes the 58-kDa structural protein P4c present on the surfaces of the intracellular mature virus (IMV) particles. The gene is disrupted in the genome of cowpox virus Brighton Red (BR), demonstrating that although the P4c protein may be advantageous for virus replication in vivo, it is not essential for virus replication in vitro. Complementation and recombination analyses with the p4c gene have shown that the P4c protein is required to direct the IMV into the A-type inclusions (ATIs) produced by cowpox virus BR. The p4c gene is highly conserved among most members of the orthopoxvirus genus, including viruses that produce ATIs, such as cowpox, ectromelia, and raccoonpox viruses, as well as those such as variola, monkeypox, vaccinia, and camelpox viruses, which do not. The conservation of the p4c gene among the orthopoxviruses, irrespective of their cap!
 acities to produce ATIs, suggests that the P4c protein provides functions in addition to that of directing IMV into ATIs. These findings, and the presence of the P4c protein in IMV but not extracellular enveloped virus (D. Ulaeto, D. Grosenbach, and D. E. Hruby, J. Virol. 70:3372-3377, 1996), suggest a model in which the P4c protein may play a role in the retrograde movement of IMV particles, thereby contributing to the retention of IMV particles within the cytoplasm and within ATIs when they are present. In this way, the P4c protein may affect both viral morphogenesis and processes of virus dissemination.

AB  - Background: The threat of smallpox and monkeypox viruses as bioterrorist weapons has prompted the search for effective antiviral therapies. These viruses do not cause disease in mice. Thus, we used a lethal cowpox virus respiratory infection mouse model for antiviral evaluations. S2242 has been found to inhibit vaccinia virus in a non-lethal tailpox mouse model, making it a potential drug candidate. Methods: BALB/c mice were infected intranasally with cowpox virus (10 animals per group held for death and 5/group for tissue virus titer determinations). Intraperitoneal (i.p.) treatments with S2242 or cidofovir (a positive control by i.p. route but not orally active) or i.p. or oral treatments with HOE961 were done for 5 or 10 days starting 24 hours after virus exposure. Results: Once daily i.p. treatments with S2242 or HOE961 (each at 100 mg/kg/day) for 5 days protected 70-80% of mice from mortality. A dose of 30 mg/kg/day of either compound was not protective. Cidofovir!
  (30 mg/kg/day) protected 100% of mice from death by this regimen. Twice daily i.p. treatments at the same daily doses of these compounds caused similar survivor increases. S2242 (100 mg/kg/day) treatments once daily for 10 days starting 24 hours after virus challenge suppressed virus replication in lungs and nasal tissue to the same degree as cidofovir (30 mg/kg/day), but cidofovir treated mice recovered more quickly from the infection (as determined by rebound in body weight). HOE961 was orally active (80% survival) when given at 100 mg/kg/day for 10 days, but had less of an inhibitory effect on lung virus titers than the other compounds. Conclusions: S2242 and HOE961 were protective against the infections but less potent than cidofovir. Because HOE961 is orally active and cidofovir is not, the former compound may have utility in treating orthopoxvirus infections in a mass exposure situation.

AB  - Genes and proteins of the kelch superfamily were structurally analyzed in the smallpox (SPV), monkeypox (MPV), cowpox (CPV), and vaccinia (VV) viruses. Genes potentially coding for the kelch-like proteins were found only in the variable terminal regions of the orthopoxvirus genome. The set and sizes of their protein products varied with species. All genes of the superfamily proved to be disrupted by mutations in SPV, which is highly pathogenic for its only host, man. The largest set of kelch-like proteins was observed for CPV, which is low-pathogenic for humans and has the broadest animal host range. The kelch-like proteins of one virus showed low homology to each other, whereas isologs of different viruses were highly homologous. The results testified to the earlier assumption that CPV is the most ancient and an ancestor of the other orthopoxviruses pathogenic for humans.

AB  - There is a concern that there may be unregistered stocks of smallpox that can be used for bioterrorism or biological warfare. According to the WHO Advisory Committee on Variola Research, there is a need to develop strategies to treat smallpox infections should they reappear. It would also be important to have an effective drug at hand for the treatment of monkeypox disease in humans. We show here that 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine (IDU) is a potent inhibitor of vaccinia virus (VV) replication and that IDU inhibits VV DNA synthesis in a dose-dependent way. The in vivo protective effect of IDU was assessed in the VV tail lesion model in immunocompetent mice and in a lethal model for VV infection in SCID (severe combined immune deficiency) mice that had been infected either intranasally, intraperitoneally, or intravenously. Subcutaneous treatment with IDU at 150 and 100 mg/kg of body weight markedly reduced the number of tail lesions in immunocompetent NMRI mice. Untreated intra!
 nasally VV-infected SCID mice died at 20.8 +- 3.1 days after infection (mean +- standard deviation). Treatment with IDU (subcutaneously, 150 mg/kg/day (from day 0 to 4) and 75 mg/kg/day (from day 6 to 11)) delayed-virus induced mortality by 15 days (mean day of death +- standard deviation, 35.8 +- 6.7; P < 0.0001). This protective effect was associated with (i) an improvement of lung histology and (ii) a marked reduction in lung viral titers. IDU also delayed VV-induced mortality when mice had either been infected intraperitoneally or intravenously. Even when the start of treatment with IDU (in intraperitoneally VV-infected mice) was postponed until 2 or 4 days after infection, an important delay in virus-induced mortality was noted.

AB  - In 1995 a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol describing the specific detection of variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, was published by Knight and others. Virulent variola major strains could be differentiated from less virulent variola minor strains because of the distinct amplicon sizes. Here, we applied this PCR protocol to DNA from various orthopoxvirus isolates. There was no amplification with the orthopoxvirus species vaccinia, monkeypox, mousepox, or camelpox viruses. However, amplification was observed in six out of 15 cowpox virus strains investigated. The size of the amplicons corresponded exactly with the size described for variola minor strains and the nucleotide sequence identity accounted for 97%. Findings are discussed with respect to the evolution of orthopoxvirus species assuming that variola virus most probably stems from a rodent-transmitted cowpox virus-like progenitor.

AB  - Cidofovir ((S)-1-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)cytosine, HPMPC) has since 1996 been licensed for clinical use in the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in AIDS patients. Cidofovir has broad-spectrum activity against virtually all DNA viruses, including herpes-, adeno-, polyoma-, papilloma- and poxviruses. Among the poxviruses, vaccinia, variola (smallpox), cowpox, monkeypox, camelpox, molluscum contagiosum and orf have proven sensitive to the inhibitory effects of cidofovir. In vivo, cidofovir has shown high efficacy, even after administration of a single systemic (intraperitoneal) or intranasal (aerosolized) dose, in protecting mice from a lethal respiratory infection with either vaccinia or cowpox. Cidofovir has also demonstrated high effectiveness in the treatment of vaccinia virus infection in severe combined immune deficiency mice. In humans, cidofovir has been used successfully in the treatment, by both the topical and intravenous route, of recal!
 citrant molluscum contagiosum and orf in immunocompromised patients. Taken together, these data indicate that cidofovir should be effective in the therapy and short-term prophylaxis of smallpox and related poxvirus infections in humans, as well as the treatment of the complications of vaccinia that may arise in immunocompromised patients inadvertently inoculated with the smallpox vaccine (vaccinia).

AB  - Monkeypox virus (MPV) belongs to the orthopoxvirus genus of the family Poxviridae, is endemic in parts of Africa, and causes a human disease that resembles smallpox. The 196,858-bp MPV genome was analyzed with regard to structural features and open reading frames. Each end of the genome contains an identical but oppositely oriented 6379-bp terminal inverted repetition, which similar to that of other orthopoxviruses, includes a putative telomere resolution sequence and short tandem repeats. Computer-assisted analysis was used to identify 190 open reading frames containing gtoreq60 amino acid residues. Of these, four were present within the inverted terminal repetition. MPV contained the known essential orthopoxvirus genes but only a subset of the putative immunomodulatory and host range genes. Sequence comparisons confirmed the assignment of MPV as a distinct species of orthopoxvirus that is not a direct ancestor or a direct descendent of variola virus, the causative ag!
 ent of smallpox.

AB  - The Brighton strain of cowpox virus causes lethal bronchopneumonia when delivered as a small-particle (1 mum) aerosol to weanling BALB/c mice. We showed previously that this disease can be prevented or cured with one subcutaneous injection of cidofovir (HPMPC, Vistide(R)). To determine whether even better results could be obtained by delivering the drug directly to the respiratory tract, we administered cidofovir by small-particle aqueous aerosol before or after aerosolized cowpox infection. In a series of five experiments, aerosol doses of 0.5-5 mg/kg were always more effective than 25 mg/kg and sometimes more effective than 100 mg/kg injected subcutaneously, as measured by changes in body and lung weight, lung viral titers, pulmonary pathology and survival. A cyclic analog ((1-((S)-2-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,4,2-dioxaphosphorinan-5-yl)methyl) cytosine) (cHPMPC) was less protective. The results suggest that aerosolized cidofovir would be effective for prophylaxis or early post!
 -exposure therapy of human smallpox or monkeypox virus infection.

AB  - The WHO smallpox eradication program was concluded 21 years ago and the non-vaccinated population is now at risk of poxvirus infections, either by contact with monkeypox or through bioterrorism. Since drugs specific against poxvirus infections are limited, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that are effective in vivo may be an important tool in controlling poxvirus infections. To this end, we studied the efficacy of the mAb C3, reactive against the trimeric 14-kDa protein of vaccinia virus (VV) localized in the membrane of the intracellular form of mature virus, for its ability to neutralize VV infection in mice. The results show that prophylactic as well as therapeutic administration of mAb C3 can be an effective means of control of VV replication within the host. The interval of antibody efficacy following a single administration, before and after VV inoculation, has been defined. This study reinforces the notion that neutralizing mAbs should be developed to c!
 ontrol health-related human infections by poxviruses.

AB  - Organization of orthopoxvirus proteins of the kelch superfamily and their genes were analyzed and compared. Complete genomic sequences of variola (VAR), monkeypox (MPV), vaccinia (VAC), and species-specific regions of cowpox (CPV) viruses were used in the work. Despite the multiplicity of kelch-like proteins in orthopoxviruses, their function is still vague. It has been discovered that the genes of orthopoxvirus kelch-like proteins are localized only to the terminal variable regions of the genome and display species-specific differences in the lengths of the proteins they potentially encode. All the genes belonging to kelch superfamily in the genome of VAR, which has the only host-the man, are mutationally destroyed. However, CPV, displaying the widest host range among orthopoxviruses, encode the most numerous set of kelch-like proteins. Weak homologies between kelch-like proteins of one virus were demonstrated as well as high homologies between isologues of different !
 orthopoxvirus species. The comparison performed suggest that CPV virus is most ancient and may be considered as the ancestor of other orthopoxviruses pathogenic for humans.

AB  - Two inhibitors of cellular inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, mycophenolic acid (MPA) and ribavirin, were evaluated for inhibitory activity against orthopoxviruses. Unrelated antipoxvirus agents tested for comparison included 6-azauridine, cidofovir (HPMPC) and cyclic HPMPC. MPA inhibited camelpox, cowpox, monkeypox and vaccinia viruses by 50% in plaque reduction assays at 0.2-3 muM in African green monkey kidney (Vero 76) and mouse 3T3 cells. Ribavirin was considerably more active in 3T3 cells (50% inhibition at 2-12 muM) than in Vero 76 cells (inhibitory at 30-250 muM) against these viruses. In cytotoxicity assays, MPA and ribavirin were more toxic to replicating cells than to stationary cell monolayers, with greater toxicity seen in 3T3 than in Vero 76 cells. The superior antiviral potency and increased toxicity of ribavirin in 3T3 cells was related to greater accumulation of mono-, di- and triphosphate forms of the drug compared with Vero 76 cells. For both MPA a!
 nd ribavirin, virus inhibition was closely correlated to the extent of suppression of intracellular guanosine triphosphate (GTP) pools. Treatment with extracellular guanosine (which restored intracellular GTP levels) did not lead to complete reversal of the anticowpox virus activity of ribavirin. This suggests that other modes of virus inhibition also appear to contribute to the anti-orthopoxvirus activity of ribavirin. Biological differences in mode of action and immunosuppressive potential between ribavirin and MPA may account for why the former compound is active against orthopoxvirus infections in animals and the latter inhibitor is not.

AB  - Cidofovir (((S)-1-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)cytosine) (HPMPC))-resistant forms of camelpox, cowpox, monkeypox, and vaccinia viruses were developed by prolonged passage in Vero 76 cells in the presence of drug. Eight- to 27-fold-higher concentrations of cidofovir were required to inhibit the resistant viruses than were needed to inhibit the wild-type (WT) viruses. Resistant viruses were characterized by determining their cross-resistance to other antiviral compounds, examining their different replication abilities in two cell lines, studying the biochemical basis of their drug resistance, and assessing the degrees of their virulence in mice. These viruses were cross resistant to cyclic HPMPC and, with the exception of vaccinia virus, to (S)-1-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)adenine. Three of the four resistant cowpox and monkeypox viruses exhibited reduced abilities to infect and replicate in 3T3 cells compared to their abilities in Vero 76 cells. Compar!
 ed to the WT virus polymers the resistant cowpox virus DNA polymerase was 8.5-fold less sensitive to inhibition by cidofovir diphosphate, the active form of the drug. Intracellular phosphorylation of (3H) cidofovir was not stimulated or inhibited by infection with resistant cowpox virus. In intranasally infected BALB/c mice, WT cowpox virus was 80-fold more virulent than the resistant virus. Cidofovir treatment (100 mg/kg of body weight, given one time only as early as 5 min after virus challenge) of a resistant cowpox virus infection could not protect mice from mortality. However, the drug prevented mortality in 80 to 100% of the mice treated with a single 100-mg/kg dose at 1, 2, 3, or 4 days after WT virus challenge. By application of these results to human orthopoxvirus infections, it is anticipated that resistant viruses may be untreatable with cidofovir but their virulence may be attenuated. Studies will need to be conducted with cidofovir-resistant monkeypox virus in !
 monkeys to further support these hypotheses.

AB  - Vaccinia virus complement-binding protein (VCP) is secreted from the cells infected with the virus and controls the complement activation reactions. This protein contains four short consensus repeats (SCR), typical of the protein family of complement activation regulators. Organization of the VCP genes/proteins of orthopoxviruses-monkeypox (MPV), variola, cowpox and vaccinia viruses-and their cellular homologues (DAF and C4BP) were studied comparatively. For this purpose, VCP genes of three MPV strains were sequenced. VCP gene sequences of other human-pathogenic orthopoxvirus species and strains determined earlier were involved in the analysis. It has been demonstrated that a premature termination of the MPV VCP open reading frame results in a truncated protein sequence carrying a deletion of the C-terminal SCR4. This is an essential distinction of MPV from other orthopoxvirus species.

AB  - Cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were exposed by fine-particle aerosol to lethal doses of monkeypox virus, Zaire strain. Death, attributable to fibrinonecrotic bronchopneumonia, occurred 9 to 17 days postexposure. Lower airway epithelium served as the principal target for primary infection. The relative degree of involvement among lymphoid tissues suggested that tonsil, mediastinal, and mandibular lymph nodes were also infected early in the course of the disease, and may have served as additional, although subordinate, sites of primary replication. The distribution of lesions was consistent with lymphatogenous spread to the mediastinal lymph nodes and systemic dissemination of the virus through a monocytic cell-associated viremia. This resulted in lesions affecting other lymph nodes, the thymus, spleen, skin, oral mucosa, gastrointestinal tract, and reproductive system. The mononuclear phagocyte/dendritic cell system was the principal target within lymphoid tis!
 sues and may also have provided the means of entry into other systemic sites. Hepatic involvement was uncommon. Lesions at all affected sites were characterized morphologically as necrotizing. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining of select lesions suggested that cell death within lymphoid and epithelial tissues was due in large part to apoptosis. Skin and mucosal surfaces of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts also exhibited variable proliferation of epithelial cells and subjacent fibroblasts. Epithelial intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies, consistent with Guarnieri bodies, were usually inconspicuous by light microscopy, but when present, were most readily apparent in the stratified squamous epithelium of the oral mucosa and epidermis. Multinucleated syncytial cells were also occasionally observed in the stratified squamous epithelium of the tongue, tonsil, and skin, and in the intestinal mucosa. M!
 onkeypox virus antigen was readily demonstrated by immunohisto!
 chemistr
y using anti-vaccinia mouse polyclonal antibodies as well as anti-monkeypox rabbit polyclonal antibodies. Detectable poxviral antigen was limited to sites exhibiting obvious morphologic involvement and was most prominent within epithelial cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and fibroblasts of affected tissues. The presence of poxviral antigen, as determined by immunohistochemistry, correlated with ultrastructural identification of replicating virus. Concurrent bacterial septicemia, present in one monkey, was associated with increased dissemination of the virus to the liver, spleen, and bone marrow and resulted in a more rapidly fatal clinical course.

AB  - Monkeypox virus (MPV) causes a human disease which resembles smallpox but with a lower person-to-person transmission rate. To determine the genetic relationship between the orthopoxviruses causing these two diseases, we sequenced the 197-kb genome of MPV isolated from a patient during a large human monkeypox outbreak in Zaire in 1996. The nucleotide sequence within the central region of the MPV genome, which encodes essential enzymes and structural proteins, was 96.3% identical with that of variola (smallpox) virus (VAR). In contrast, there were considerable differences between MPV and VAR in the regions encoding virulence and host-range factors near the ends of the genome. Our data indicate that MPV is not the direct ancestor of VAR and is unlikely to naturally acquire all properties of VAR.

AB  - Although smallpox was eradicated 20 years ago, other members of the genus Orthopoxvirus (OPV), such as cowpox virus (CPXV) or monkeypox virus, are still a threat to humans. Because human CPXV infection is rare, it is seldom suspected on clinical grounds only. We report a boy who presented with two necrotic ulcers with surrounding erythema. Infection with OPV was suspected, as antibiotic treatment had not produced improvement and smears were negative for anthrax. An OPV was isolated and an OPV-specific polymerase chain reaction combined with a subsequent restriction enzyme fragment length polymorphism assay confirmed infection by CPXV. Although the patient's cat had had no skin lesions, OPV-specific antibodies were found a titre of 1 : 8 in a plaque reduction assay, suggesting that the cat had transmitted the virus to the boy.

This minireview provides guidelines for the isolation of patients and management of staff exposed to the following infectious diseases with documented person-to-person transmission: Andes hantavirus disease, anthrax, B virus infection, hemorrhagic fevers (due to Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Argentine hemorrhagic fever, and Bolivian hemorrhagic fever viruses), monkeypox, plague, Q fever, and rabies. Several of these infections may also be encountered as bioterrorism hazards (i.e., anthrax, hemorrhagic fever viruses, plague, and Q fever). Adherence to recommended isolation precautions will allow for proper patient care while protec!
 ting the health care workers who provide care to patients with known or suspected zoonotic infections capable of nosocomial transmission.

AB  - A restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay was developed to identify and differentiate Old World, African-Eurasian orthopoxviruses (OPV): variola, vaccinia, cowpox, monkeypox, camelpox, ectromelia, and taterapox viruses. The test uses amplicons produced from virus genome DNA by PCR with a consensus primer pair designed from sequences determined for the cytokine response modifier B (crmB) gene of 43 different OPV strains of known taxonomic origin. The primer pair amplified a single specific product from each of the 115 OPV samples tested. Size-specific amplicons identified and differentiated ectromelia and vaccinia virus strains, which contain a truncated crmB gene, and enabled their differentiation from other OPV species. Restriction digests of amplified products allowed the identification and differentiation of variola, monkeypox, camelpox, vaccinia, and cowpox virus species and strains.

AB  - Hunting provides one mechanism for the transmission of microbes across host species boundaries. It has generally been assumed that this mechanism leads to unidirectional transmission to humans. We report that wild chimpanzees occasionally prey on human children. This result and other evidence of chimpanzee hunting show the need for consideration of more complex predation-mediated host networks.

AB  - Transmission of an animal virus to man is probably a constant reality. Pathogenicity is is not inevitable. Some vaccines were contaminated by cell culture but remain safe. Haemorrhagic fevers, despite limited outbreaks, are often cited in the media. On the other hand, the influenza A virus has been responsible for a large mortality. The cases of human infection with simian viruses (herpes virus B, cytomegalovirus, spumavirus, immunodeficiency virus) were accidental and have always remained asymptomatic. Monkeypox virus emerges in only some outbreaks. No transmission of animal endogenous retrovirus has been described. The precautionary principle, in the face of an unquantifiable risk, supposes that preventive measures should be taken in advance to reduce the risk at each step: isolation of the animal source after hysterotomy, transport in a germ-free environment, procurement and transplantation in rigorous surgical conditions, long-term follow-up surveillance of the pat!
 ient, his or her family and healthcare workers. All the phases of the xenotransplantation procedure should be taken to limit the number of places and persons coming into contact with the recipient.

AB  - During and after the smallpox eradication campaign, human cases of monkeypox appeared in West and Central Africa, as isolated cases or as small epidemics. Since inter-human transmission has never or only very exceptionally been documented, monkeypox does not represent a serious threat to humans. The virus reservoir is among tree squirrels living in the tropical rain forests of Africa and humans are infected by hunting, killing and skinning these animals. However, the modernisation of society lessens human contact with the virus reservoir. Since the eradication of smallpox, stocks of variola virus have been maintained; whether these stocks should now be destroyed is a political question, which is seriously compromised by mistrust between countries.

AB  - Many new, emerging and re-emerging diseases of humans are caused by pathogens which originate from animals or products of animal origin. A wide variety of animal species, both domestic and wild, act as reservoirs for these pathogens, which may be viruses, bacteria or parasites. Given the extensive distribution of the animal species affected, the effective surveillance, prevention and control of zoonotic diseases pose a significant challenge. The authors describe the direct and indirect implications for public health of emerging zoonoses. Direct implications are defined as the consequences for human health in terms of morbidity and mortality. Indirect implications are defined as the effect of the influence of emerging zoonotic disease on two groups of people, namely: health professionals and the general public. Professional assessment of the importance of these diseases influences public health practices and structures, the identification of themes for research and allo!
 cation of resources at both national and international levels. The perception of the general public regarding the risks involved considerably influences policy-making in the health field. Extensive outbreaks of zoonotic disease are not uncommon, especially as the disease is often not recognised as zoonotic at the outset and may spread undetected for some time. However, in many instances, the direct impact on health of these new, emerging or re-emerging zoonoses has been small compared to that of other infectious diseases affecting humans. To illustrate the tremendous indirect impact of emerging zoonotic diseases on public health policy and structures and on public perception of health risks, the authors provide a number of examples, including that of the Ebola virus, avian influenza, monkeypox and bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Recent epidemics of these diseases have served as a reminder of the existence of infectious diseases and of the capacity of these diseases to occ!
 ur unexpectedly in new locations and animal species. The need !
 for grea
ter international co-operation, better local, regional and global networks for communicable disease surveillance and pandemic planning is also illustrated by these examples. These diseases have contributed to the definition of new paradigms, especially relating to food safety policies and more generally to the protection of public health. Finally, the examples described emphasise the importance of intersectorial collaboration for disease containment, and of independence of sectorial interests and transparency when managing certain health risks.

AB  - A combinatorial, phage-display library of human Fab antibody fragments was generated from IgG heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC) genes cloned from the lymphocytes of a vaccinia virus (VACV)-immune donor. To ascertain the complexity of the library, nucleotide sequences of the variable regions of the HC and LC genes were determined. Fourteen distinct HC and 18 distinct LC (7 kappa and 11 lambda) that formed a combinatorial library of 22 Fabs were identified. Immune-precipitation of radiolabeled VACV revealed that at least six different VACV proteins were recognized by the antibodies. Plaque-reduction neutralization demonstrated that six of the Fabs neutralized VACV in the presence of anti-human antibody. ELISA studies indicated that 15 of the Fabs were cross-reactive with monkeypox virus.

AB  - The open reading frame coding for the A-type inclusion body protein (ATI) of monkeypox virus (MPV) was identified and sequenced for two strains. Nucleotide sequence comparison revealed 72-95.3% homology with the reported open reading frame sequences of the ATIs of other orthopoxvirus species, such as variola, vaccinia, cowpox, ectromelia, and camelpox viruses. Each MPV strain contained an 8-bp deletion, which caused a frameshift that introduced a premature stop in the open reading frame at base 2091 relative to the ATI open reading frame of cowpox virus strain Brighton. The sequences enabled a primer pair to be designed that flanked the deletion and specifically amplified a 601-bp fragment that identified and differentiated 19 MPV strains examined from five other Old World orthopoxvirus species examined. The specificity was confirmed by cleavage of the 19 MPV strain amplicons with BglII, which produced three subfragments of expected sized, based on the determined MPV s!
 equences.

AB  - Orthopoxvirus species were identified and differentiated by polymerase chain reaction amplification of genome DNA using a single primer-pair based on sequences coding for the major protein component of the cowpox virus acidophilic-type inclusion body (ATI). DNA available for 6 of 8 Old World (cowpox, variola, monkeypox, camelpox, ectromelia and vaccinia viruses) and 3 New World (skunkpox, volepox, and raccoonpox) resulted in amplicons that ranged in size from 510 to 1673 base pairs depending on the species, except for raccoonpox virus DNA which did not amplify. XbaI digest gel electrophoresis profiles of the amplicons improved resolution of the differences.

AB  - We have sequenced DNA equivalent to the E5R ORF of Copenhagen vaccinia virus from an additional strain of vaccinia and from cowpox (three strains), camelpox (two strains), taterapox and ectromelia viruses. None of these showed the disruptions previously reported in the equivalent region of monkeypox virus. We also constructed a viable recombinant of vaccinia virus strain Dairen in which the E5R sequence was disrupted by a 436 hp deletion and substitution of the E. coli gpt gene. Quantitative analysis of the sequences, including available sequences from monkeypox, variola and vaccinia viruses revealed four main groupings, namely cowpox, ectromelia, monkeypox and a cluster which includes variola, camelpox, taterapox and vaccinia viruses. It was noted that, at over 75% of the positions which differentiated species, all species but one had a common nucleotide. Although the analysis covers one single gene only, the results accord with what is known of the biology of the vir!
 uses.

AB  - Rapid identification and differentiation of orthopoxviruses by PCR were achieved with primers based on genome sequences encoding the hemagglutinin (HA) protein, an infected-cell membrane antigen that distinguishes orthopoxviruses from other poxvirus genera. The initial identification step used a primer pair of consensus sequences for amplifying an HA DNA fragment from the three known North American orthopoxviruses (raccoonpox, skunkpox, and volepox viruses), and a second pair for amplifying virtually the entire HA open reading frame of the Eurasian-African orthopoxviruses (variola, vaccinia, cowpox, monkeypox, camelpox, ectromelia, and gerbilpox viruses). RsaI digest electropherograms of the amplified DNAs of the former subgroup provided species differentiation, and TaqI digests differentiated the Eurasian-African orthopoxviruses, including vaccinia virus from the vaccinia virus subspecies buffalopox virus. Endonuclease HhaI digest patterns distinguished smallpox vario!
 la major viruses from alastrim variola minor viruses. For the Eurasian-African orthopoxviruses, a confirmatory step that used a set of higher-sequence-homology primers was developed to provide sensitivity to discern individual virus HA DNAs from cross-contaminated orthopoxvirus DNA samples; Taql and HhaI digestions of the individual amplified RA DNAs confirmed virus identity. Finally, a set of primers and modified PCR conditions were developed on the basis of base sequence differences within the HA genes of the 10 species, which enabled production of a single DNA fragment of a particular size that indicated the specific species.

AB  - A ligase chain reaction (LCR) assay was developed to distinguish cowpox virus from other Orthopoxvirus species. The LCR targets two adjacent adenosine residues which are only present in the A-type inclusion protein gene (ATI-gene) of cowpox virus. Two primer pairs were designed with a one base pair overlap at the junction site and one primer of each pair was labeled radioactively. Detection of the ligation product was achieved after denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Prior to LCR, the corresponding region of the ATI-gene was amplified by a consensus primer-directed polymerase chain reaction. All 18 cowpox virus isolates investigated could be clearly discriminated from 10 vaccinia virus strains, 5 camelpox virus isolates, as well as from mousepox and monkeypox virus reference strains. The LCR method allows a fast identification of cowpox virus isolates and is a feasible tool for the analysis of small mutations within viral genes.

AB  - A PCR protocol was established that not only allows the detection of, but also the differentiation of species of the genus Orthopoxvirus. This assay was accomplished by the selection of oligonucleotides located within the gene that encodes the A-type inclusion protein of cowpox virus. The primer pair flanked a region exhibiting distinct and specific DNA deletions in the corresponding sequences of vaccinia, mousepox, monkeypox and camelpox virus. For this reason, PCR resulted in DNA fragments of different sizes. The presented PCR protocol. combined with BglII restriction digests, allowed the unequivocal assignment of 42 orthopoxvirus (OPV) strains and isolates to the correct OPV species. The resulting classification corresponded exactly with known biological data for the OPV strains investigated. Furthermore, 13 out of 22 cowpox virus isolates could be subtyped by the presence or absence of a small BglII fragment. DNA sequencing showed that the lack of this BglII fragme!
 nt was caused by a deletion of 72 nucleotides.

AB  - DNA from isolates of monkeypox virus, when digested with the endonuclease PstI, gave fragment-size profiles which correlated with the geographic area from which the isolate originated. Although some of the differences were located subterminally in the genome, others mapped to the central conserved region. Further differentiation of the viral genomes was sought by analysis of a short region within the central conserved part of the genome that appeared to be a partially deleted counterpart of an intact 1024 hp open reading frame (ORF) present in variola and vaccinia virus genomes. We reasoned that this region would not be conserved by functional selection and would therefore be likely to show more variation between isolates of monkeypox virus. The deletions found in monkeypox virus isolates from Liberia and from Benin were almost the same as that which we had previously found in the Denmark strain. A much shortened ORF, potentially coding for a product of 133 amino acids!
 , was retained in all three West African isolates, but three Zairean isolates each showed an identical series of small insertions and deletions which effectively abolish the ORF. Three deletions, present in all isolates, must pre-date the geographical separation of monkeypox virus lineages; other, presumably more recent, changes differ between the Zairean and West African isolates. In contrast, the base similarity was found to be more than 99% when all the monkeypox virus sequences were appropriately aligned. This, in a disrupted and presumably nonfunctional gene also indicates that the changes described are recent. It is suggested that insertions and deletions occur regularly during poxvirus DNA replication, but are preserved only in sequences that are not required for continued transmission in the natural host.

AB  - A 14-kDa gene-specific probe of vaccinia virus Western Reserve (WR) hybridized to homologous sequences in the genomes of the orthopox virus species cowpox, camelpox, mousepox, and monkeypox virus. The corresponding genes were mapped and sequenced. Homologies of more than 95% were found when compared to the 14-kDa gene of vaccinia virus WR. However, point mutations which led to alterations in the amino acid sequences were mainly located between residues 26 and 40. By use of synthetic peptides, this part of the 14-kDa fusion protein could be identified as the binding site for four different neutralizing monoclonal antibodies.

AB  - Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were generated against vaccinia virus, cowpox virus KR2 Brighton, monkeypox virus Copenhagen, or ectromelia virus. Pairwise epitope specificity studies by competition ELISAs identified 23 distinct antigenic sites in 19 different orthopox virus strains. Six epitopes were completely independent of each other, and 17 closely related antigenic sites formed three separate epitope complexes. As shown by immunogold electron microscopy (ELMI), all MAbs reacted with epitopes in the envelope of intracellular naked virus, 16 MAbs recognized proteins of 32, 30, 16 or 14 kDa in Western blotting (WB), and 9 MAbs neutralized virus infectivity. In rabbitpox virus (RPV) 18 epitopes were detected. A lambda-gt11 expression library of RPV DNA was screened with the corresponding 18 MAbs. Fourteen recombinant bacteriophage clones (ph) were isolated. Cross-hybridizations of phage and RPV DNA demonstrated a reaction with the HindIII A, HindIII D, or HindIII H frag!
 ments, respectively. DNA of ph3D was related to the A25L gene, which corresponds to the A-type inclusion body gene of cowpox virus. Two phage clones contained sequences of the 14-kDa fusion protein gene (A27L gene). PhlA contained nearly the entire 14-kDa gene encoding 4 neutralizing (neutr) and 2 nonneutr epitopes. Ph5, expressing only half of this gene product, encoded 1 nonneutr epitope. The fusion protein of vaccinia virus MVA was isolated by immune-affinity chromatography with a neutr. catching MAb. The protein formed hollow rods (ELMI) and the 6 antigenic sites that were present were identical to those expressed by Escherichia coli infected with ph1A. WB detection with a polyclonal hyperimmune serum detected protein bands of 54, 32, 30, 16, and 14 kDa. The catching MAb bound only to a 16-kDa band. The purified fusion protein induced neutralizing antibodies in mice and rabbits.

AB  - A gene was identified in camelpox virus strain CP-1 that is similar to the 160K gene of cowpox virus strain Brighton (BR) that encodes the A-type inclusion body protein (ATIP). The CP-1 gene was mapped, sequenced, and the presence of the ATIP-specific mRNA was demonstrated. The open reading frame (2178 nucleotides (nt)) was found at a similar position in the CP genome as the one reported for the cowpox virus 160K ATI gene. DNA sequence comparison revealed a deletion of two adjacent adenine residues relative to cowpox virus BR, generating a reading frame shift accompanied by the formation of a translational stop codon. An identical deletion has been described for vaccinia virus strain Western Reserve. The DNA sequence of the corresponding region of monkeypox virus strain Copenhagen revealed a deletion leading to a putative stop codon 75 nt upstream of the same stop codons in the camelpox and vaccinia virus genes. These findings are consistent with the expression of trun!
 cated ATIPs, of 94K in vaccinia and camelpox viruses and of 92K in monkeypox virus. In addition, a deletion of 789 bp could be localized downstream of the ATI open reading frame in camelpox virus isolates of different origin. This causes the transcription of a shortened ATI-specific mRNA (3.7 kb) relative to vaccinia and cowpox viruses (both 4.5 kb). The similarity observed in ATIP-encoding and flanking sequences might suggest that vaccinia and camelpox viruses are descended from a common ancestor.

AB  - Smallpox was eradicated more than 10 years ago, but infection with another Orthopoxivirus, monkeypox virus, can result in a clinical picture resembling smallpox. Human infection with monkeypox virus is extremely rare, not easily transmitted, and confined to the rain forest belt of African (Z. Jezek and F. Fenner, p. 81-102, in Human Monkeypox, 1988). Evidence that variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, might be readily derived from monkeypox virus was presented (S. S. Marennikova and E. M. Shelukhina, Nature (London) 276:291-292, 1978; S.S. Marennikova, E. M. Shelukhina, N.N. Maltseva, and G.R. Matsevich, Intervirology 11:333-3340, 1979), but this was not confirmed (K.R. Dumbell and L. C. Archard, Nature (London) 286:29-32, 1980) and was subsequently discounted (J. J. Esposito, J. H. Nakano, and J. F. Obijeski, Bull. W.H O. 63: 695-703, 1985). Although enough difference between the genomes of monkeypox and variola viruses to rule out a simple interconversion h!
 as been demonstrated (K. R. Dumbell and L. C. Archard, Nature (London) 286:29-32, 1980; J.J. Esposito and J. C. Knight, Virology 143:230-251, 1985; J.J. Esposito, J. H. Nakano, and J. F. Obijeski, Bull. W.H.O. 63:695-703, 1985; M. Mackett and L. C. Archard, J. Gen. Virol. 45:683-701, 1979), the possibility that monkeypox virus was a more remote ancestor of variola virus remained. We have now identified a sequence in monkeypox virus DNA which is a homolog of a 1,065-bp open reading frame in the conserved region of the variola virus genome but which has multiple deletions. This is strong evidence that monkeypox virus is not ancestral to variola virus and strengthens confidence in the long-term success of smallpox eradication.

AB  - Human monkeypox was suspected on clinical grounds in a seven years old child in Cameroon. The diagnosis was confirmed at the Center for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, USA. This condition is rare. The present case is the third in Cameroon. An epidemilogical and clinical survey carried out in the family and in the area where the patient lives, did not allow to identify other cases. The clinical evolution of the case was good as in those described elsewhere.

AB  - We report about the infection of an 18-year-old man with an orthopox virus (OPV) which was transmitted by a cat. The infectious route from cat to man could be proved by epidemiological, virological and serological methods. The corresponding techniques are described. The patient had not been vaccinated against smallpox and was intensively immunosuppressed by medication on account of a severe endogeneous eczema combined with an allergic asthma bronchiale. A cyclic poxvirus disease developed with a generalized, partly confluent pox virus exanthema disseminated over the body. The clinical symptoms were similar to a "variola pustulosa hemorrhagica". The young man died of a lung embolism in the course of the intensive medical therapy. The hemorrhagic character of the pox virus pustules with central necrosis (pox navel) could be reproduced in the rabbit skin and on chorioallantois membranes. The pox virus isolated from the patient could be differentiated from variola, vaccini!
 a and monkeypox virus. It is a member of the group of "cowpox-like viruses". The environmental importance of these OPVs is discussed.

AB  - An enzyme immunoassay (EIA) system for the species-specific diagnosis of monkeypox, based on the use of monoclonal antibodies (McAb) to monkeypox virus, has been developed. Immunoglobulins, isolated from McAb-containing cultural and immune ascitic fluids, have been conjugated with horse-radish peroxidase and used as detector antibodies. For immunosorption, rabbit polyclonal antibodies to the vaccine virus have been used. The specificity and sensitivity of the EIA system thus obtained have been tested in animals and humans having monkeypox and confirmed by traditional diagnostic methods (the isolation of the virus on chick embryo choriochorioallantoic membranes and in cell culture).

AB  - Aligned sequences from the same family (e.g. the haemoglobins) are seldom representative of the entire family. This is because (1) the sequence databases are heavily skewed toward a small number of organisms and (2) only a minute fraction of all the different family members have been sequenced. For many applications, such as using alignments or profiles to perform database searches for distantly related family members, such unequal representation requires correction. An algorithm to perform appropriate weighting of individual sequences is presented along with examples illustrating its efficacy.

AB  - The nucleotide sequences of homologous regions from the genomes of variola major strain Harvey, variola minor strains Butler and Garcia, and monkeypox strain Denmark were determined. The nucleotide sequences were compared to the homologous region in vaccinia virus which contains part of one of the genes involved in determining host range. Two major differences were detected; these corresponded to a deletion in the promoter region and the presence of a premature stop codon. It was concluded that this region of the genome may not be actively expressed in either variola- or monkeypox-virus-infected cells. It was also concluded that diagnostic nucleic acid hydridization probes for differentiating between these members of the Orthopoxviridae may be difficult to identify.

AB  - The thymidine kinase gene of African swine fever virus was mapped in a 1.4-kb Eco RI-PstI fragment located in the left half of the Eco RI K fragment of African swine fever virus DNA by using degenerate oligonucleotide probes derived from regions of the thymidine kinase sequence conserved in several poxviruses, man, mouse, and chicken. The nucleotide sequence of this region revealed an open reading frame of 196 codons, whose translated amino acid sequence showed significant similarity to the thymidine kinases of vaccinia virus, variola virus, monkeypox virus, shope fibroma virus, fowlpox virus, capripox virus, man, mouse, and chicken. The similarity scores obtained after comparison of known thymidine kinase sequence indicated that the African swine fever virus thymidine kinase is more distantly related than the poxvirus thymidine kinases to their cellular homologs. The evolutionary implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - Thymidine kinase enzymes isolated from a variety of sources are generally considered to have a native molecular weight of 80-90 kDa composed of two 40-45 kDa subunits. Although these parameters may accurately describe the atypical deoxypyrimidine kinases expressed by members of the Herpesviridae, the nucleotide sequences of thymidine kinase genes isolated from human, mouse, chicken and a variety of poxviruses (vaccinia virus, monkeypox virus, variola virus, fowlpox virus and capripoxvirus) predict molecular weights on the order of 20-25 kDa for the derived primary translation products. To resolve this apparent dilemma, velocity sedimentation centrifugation, gel filtration chromatography and protein cross-linking procedures were employed to provide experimental evidence that enzymatically-active vaccinia virus thymidine kinase is a homotetrameric complex of 20 kDa monomers with a native Mr of 80 kDa.

AB  - Various combinations of polyclonal and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) of distinct specificity were evaluated as capture or detecting antibodies in an orthpox virus antigen ELISA. Acceptable results were achieved in an assay based on polyclonal antibodies. A 10 times higher sensitivity, however, was obtained using a combination of one monoclonal catching antibody reactive with viral envelope epitopes and polyclonal detection antibodies. This configuration proved to be superior to sensitivity to all others. Specificity was confirmed with 5 vaccinia virus strains (including one recombinant virus) and 8 species of orthopox viruses. Monkeypox and mousepox virus reacted exclusively in the polyclonal assay due to a lack of the specific epitope for the monoclonal antibody. The detection limit compared to the infectivity titer amounted to 103-104 in the monoclonal/polyclonal and to 104-105 TCID50/0.1ml in the polyclonal combination. The correlation between infectivit!
 y- and ELISA-titer was demonstrated by a study of the replication cycle of the rabbitpox virus. Uetrecht in the permanent rabbit kidney cell line RK-13. With the established ELISAs vaccinia virus could also be detected in organ suspensions of lethally infected NMRI-mice, depending on the level of infectivity.

AB  - In accordance with recommendation of the Global Commission on the certification of smallpox eradication for the 10-year period after the eradication of this infection, all suspected cases of smallpox have been thoroughly checked up, and in none of them the diagnosis of smallpox has been confirmed. The study of monkeypox in humans has revealed that this zoonosis is spread over a wider area than supposed earlier and covers 7 countries of Equatorial Africa, occurring most frequently in Zaire. In about 70% of cases of monkeypox in human the disease is contracted from animals serving as natural virus carriers and in about one-third of such cases, from humans having monkeypox. The infectivity of humans with monkeypox for persons having close contacts with them is somewhat lower (12.3%) than in smallpox when this characteristic varies from 37% to 88%. Monkeypox in humans may take an asymptomatic course. Some species of tropical squirrels serve as natural virus carriers. These!
  investigations have also resulted in essential corrections being made in understanding the ecology of cowpox virus, another orthopoxvirus pathogenic for man. At least 5 species of rodents have proved to be of interest as natural carriers of cowpox virus.

AB  - Recent investigations have revealed that monkeypox virus infections occur with a high prevalence in several species of squirrels belonging to the genus Funisciurus, less frequently in squirrels of the genus Heliosciurus, and rarely in forest-dwelling primates. These squirrels commonly inhabit the secondary forests around human settlements in the rural areas of Zaire, especially where oil palms are grown, and are rare in the primary rain forest. Human infection with monkeypox virus occurs most frequently in the 5-9-year-old age group, particularly in small villages where the children hunt and eat squirrels and other small mammals. As the populations are now increasing in number and can no longer feed on wild life alone for their animal protein requirements, the development of animal husbandary as a source of meat will certainly decrease the risk and the incidence of human monkeypox, even in areas where monkeypox virus is present in the local population of squirrels. Alt!
 hough population growth and economic development in western and central Africa will probably reduce the risk of human infection with monkeypox virus, visitors to these areas who are likely to come into contact with wild animals should be offered smallpox vaccination as a protection.

AB  - Human monkeypox is a zoonosis occurring sporadically in the tropical rain forest of western and central Africa. The exact incidence and geographical distribution are unknown, since many cases are not recognized. Special surveillance was established in three regions in Zaire in 1981 that led to a substantial increase in reported cases. The question arose as to the possibility that clinical diagnostic errors cause some cses of monkeypox to be misdiagnosed as other eruptive diseases. This paper presents the results of a study assessing the extent of and reasons for these clinical diagnostic errors in areas where health staff as well as the general public are aware of human monkeypox. In Zaire in the period 1981-1986,977 persons with skin eruption not clinically diagnosed as human monkeypox were laboratory tested. 3.3% of human monkeypox cases were found among 730 patients diagnosed as cases of chickenpox, 7.3% among cases diagnosed as "atypical chikenpox" and 6.1% among c!
 ases with skin rash for which clinical diagnosis could not be established. The diagnostic difficulties were mainly based on clinical features characteristic of chickenpox: regional pleomorphism (in 46% of misdiagnosed cases), indefinite body-distribution of skin eruptions (49%), and centripetal distribution of skin lesion (17%). Lymph-node enlargement was observed in 76% of misdiagnosed patients. In the absence of small pox, the main clinical diagnostic problem is the differentiation of human monkeypox from chickenpox. The presence of lymphadenopathy, pre-eruptive fever and slower maturation of skin lesions are the most important clinical signs supporting correct diagnosis of monkeypox.

AB  - During the course of the smallpox eradication programme, a new eruptive disease clinically resembling smallpox was discovered in Zaire. The disease, which was named monkeypox after the virus, is a zoonosis occurring sporadically in countries of western and central Africa with tropical rain forest. The studies carried out in Zaire from 1980 through 1985 showed that monkeypox affects mainly children in relatively small remote villages whose population has traditionally frequent contacts with wild animals. Apart from the wildlife, the virus can be transmitted from man to man, but among other sources of infection sick persons did not exceed 20%. Presumed human transmission has occurred in 38 out of 61 outbreaks of human monkeypox and only once reached the third and once the fourth generation; the transmission in all affected villages under observation has exterminated itself. Considering the sporadic and relatively rare occurrence of the disease and expected complications !
 following the immunization with vaccinia which protects from monkeypox, introduction of mass vaccination in the areas at risk is hardly justifyed at present.

AB  - Data on monkeypox in Zaire over the five years 1980-1984 are analysed to assess the protection imparted by past smallpox vaccination and the transmission potential of the virus in unvaccinated communities. Attack rates in individuals with and without vaccination scars indicated that smallpox vaccination (discontinued in 1980) imparted approximately 85% protection against monkeypox. It is predicted that monkeypox virus will continue to be introduced into human communities from animal sources, and that the average magnitude and duration of monkeypox epidemics will increase as vaccine-derived protection declines in the population. On the other hand, current evidence indicates that the virus is appreciably less transmissible than was smallpox, and that it will not persist in human communites, even in the total absence of vaccination. The findings thus support the recommendation of the Global Commission for the Certification of Smallpox Eradication to cease routine smallpox!
  vaccination in monkeypox endemic areas, but to encourage continued epidemiological surveillance.

AB  - Data on human monkeypox collected in Zaire during the six years 1981-86 were analysed to assess the extent of interhuman transmission of monkeypox virus. Among the 2278 persons who had close contact with 245 monkeypox patients infected from an animal source 93 fell ill and were presumed to have been infected from the known human source: 69 of these were spread in the first generation, 19 in the second generation, and the remaining five cases in the third and fourth generation. The secondary attack rates were correlated with the age, sex, place of residence, and vaccination status of the contacts. There was an overall 3% probability of becoming ill following infection from a known human source. The affected household was the main focal point for interhuman transmission of monkeypox virus. The highest attack rate (11.7%) occurred among unvaccinated household contacts in the age group 0-4 years. However, the majority of susceptible persons who had been close to patients i!
 n the confined space of poorly ventilated huts failed to develop illness. There was no evidence of an increase in the secondary attack rate bwtween 1970-80 and 1981-86. The inefficient spread from person to person, even in conditions of maximum exposure, supports the concept that monkeypox virus is poorly adapted for sustained transmission does not pose a significant health problem.

AB  - Clinical and laboratory examinations were carried out on a total of 338 monkeypox patients in Zaire from 1981 to 1986. An animal source of infection was suspected in 245 (72%) and interhuman transmission for the remaining 93 patients. Among those whose infection was presumably acquired from an animal source, the most affected groups were children aged 3-4 years (27%) and 5-6 years (20%), while only 4% of cases were over 15 years old; there was a considerable preponderance of males (58%) over females (42%), especially in the age group 5-14 years. Among those presumably infected by person-to-person transmission, the age distribution was more uniform, adult patients tending to be relatively more common, and there were more females (57%) than males (43%). Based on comparisons of the frequency and intensity of clinical signs and symptoms among patients infected from an animal source and those who were infected by another patient, there was no evidence that the disease becom!
 es more severe and the transmitted virus more virulent or more easily transmissible from person to person after one or more passages through human hosts.

AB  - Human monkeypox is a zoonosis that occurs sporadically in the tropical rainforest of western and central Africa. This article presents the results of epidemiological features of 91 monkeypox patients reported in Bumba zone in northern Zaire during the period 1981 to 1985. Their age ranged from 7 months to 29 years (93% below 15 years of age). 11% of patients had visible smallpox vaccination scars. Deaths occurred sporadically; the overall case-fatality rate was 9%. 91 patients arose in 61 separate outbreaks; 42 of them consisted of only a single case. The source of infection was suspected to be animal for 70 cases, and human for the remaining 21 cases. The illness occurred in all months of the year. There was a considerable clustering of cases in the northern part of the zone. The average annual incidence rate in the observed zone was 0.63 cases per 10,000 population with marked differences in age, time and place. The average annual primary attack rate among unvaccinat!
 ed individuals (1.7/10,000) sharply contrasted with those vaccinated (0.04/10,000). The secondary attack rate for contacts without vaccination scar (4.3%) differed significantly from those who had been vaccinated in past (0.7%). Many unvaccinated contacts living under conditions of maximal exposure to index cases escaped not only the disease but also infection. The low incidence rate of human monkeypox indicates its limited public health importance even in a well-known enzootic area.

AB  - Epitopes on the surface components of orthopoxviruses were analyzed with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against monkeypox and vaccina viruses by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blotting (WB), radioimmunoprecipitation (RIP), and competitive binding inhibition assay (CBIA). When compared by ELISA, three vaccinia virus strains exhibited a similar reactivity to 99 tested MAbs despite their remote passage history. All five isolates of monkeypox virus closely resembled one another, irrespective of the host species (human, monkey, squirrel) from which they were isolated. Taterapox virus reacted similar to vaccinia virus against 97 of the 99 tested MAbs, and reacted with 2 MAbs which were cross-reactive with monkeypox and mousepox. Mousepox and cowpox viruses reacted with these MAbs in a species-specific manner: MAbs reactive to cowpox virus distinctly differ from those reactive to mousepox virus. Of the 99 tested MAbs, 32 reactd with all the 11 tested orthopo!
 xviruses, indicating that the corresponding epitopes existed in all the viruses. Fifty-four MAbs reacted with two or more virus species and were classified as partially common MAbs. Eight MAbs were apparently type-specific for monkeypox, and five were specific for vaccinia and taterapox viruses. No strain-specific epitope was detected. Sera of monkeypox-infected patients, when analyzed by CBIA, interfered with the binding of monkeypox-specific Mab H12C1 but not of vaccinia-specific Mab G6C6. Sera of monkeypox-infected patients who had been vaccinated competed against both Mabs, demonstrating the original antigenic sin phenomenon. The two Mabs could distinguish between the sera of monkeypox patients and those of vaccinated persons. However, the serum of a smallpox patient was competitive against these apparently vaccinia- or monkeypox-specific Mabs. Three of the eight monkeypox-specific epitopes were recognized by the above CBIA test, which suggests that they also exist in s!
 mallpox virus. The mosaic-like combination of common epitopes !
 and the 
small number of type-specific epitopes manifested the antigenic characteristics of orthopox viruses. The species boundary was obscured due to the partially common epitopes, but the total composition of epitopes was stable enough to maintain the antigenic species-specificity. The mutual relationship of the orthopoxviruses was visualized in a three-dimensional network.

AB  - With the eradication of smallpox, systemtic routine vaccination with vaccinia has ceased and an increasing proportion of the human population in tropical rain forest areas of central and western Africa lacks vaccinia-derived immunity to monkeypox virus. This raises the question of the ability of monkeypox virus to establish and maintain itself in an unvaccinated population through continuous man-to-man transmission. A computerized stochastic model of Monte Carlo type was constructed to assess this potential risk. Simulated series were repeated 100 times to obtain distributions of predicted outcomes for decreasing levels of vaccination coverage (70 percent, 50 percent, and 0 percent). The results revealed a substantial increase in new secondary cases in the total absence of vaccinia-induced immunity. Nevertheless, none of the simulated series did lead to an "explosive" epidemic. The model clearly indicated diminishing numbers of cases in successive generations and event!
 ual cessation of transmission. Therefore, it appears highly improbable that the virus could maintain itself permanently in communities by interhuman transmission. After the eradication of smallpox, human monkeypox constitutes the most important orthopoxvirus infection in man, but analysis of information collected up to this time suggests that it does not represent currently a serious public health problem or a challenge to the achieved eradication of smallpox.

AB  - When the research on the ecology of monkeypox virus entered the latest stage in 1984, three groups of animals were considered priority candidates for maintenance of virus circulations in nature because of their relatively higher population density: terrestrial rodents, squirrels, and gregarious bats. Following the isolation of the virus from a wild squirrel in 1985 another survey was carried out in Bumba zone of Zaire in January-February 1986, which included collection of animal samples, later on tested by WHO collaborating laboratories. No antibodies were found in 233 rodents tested. A high prevalence of monkeypox-specific antibodies (24.7%) found in 320 squirrels of Funisciurus anerythrus species suggested that these animals sustain virus transmission in the areas surounding human settlements. A consistently high level of antibody prevalence found among squirrels Heliosciurus rufobrachium suggested that this speciesis also steadily involved in the transmission. The s!
 quirrels, the only animals frequently infected by monkeypox in the areas of human activities, which are frequently trapped by the population, are obviously a major source of infection for human beings. Out of 39 primates collected during the survey from the primary forest, three were found seropositive for monkeypox. At the moment, however, it is difficult to say whether the primates play an important role in sustaining virus transmission in nature, or (like human beings) that they are in occasional host of the virus. Possibilities are discussed of monkeypox virus transmission being sustained by squirrels outside the area of major human activities.

AB  - We present the clinical features and course of 282 patients with human monkeypox in Zaire during 1980-1985. The ages of the patients ranged from one month to 69 years; 90% were <15 years of age. The clinical picture was similar to that of the ordinary and modified forms of smallpox. Lymphadenopathy, occurring in the early stage of the illness, was the most important sign differentiating human monkeypox from smallpox and chickenpox. The symptoms, signs, and the course of the disease in patients who had been vaccinated against smallpox differed significantly from those in unvaccinated subjects. Pleomorphism and "cropping" similar to that in chickenpox occurred in 31% of vaccinated and 18% of unvaccinated patients. The prognosis depended largely on the presence of severe complications. No deaths occurred among vaccinated patients. In unvaccinated patients the crude case-fatality rate was 11% but was higher among the youngest children (15%).

AB  - Since monkeypox virus was discovered in animals in 1958 and in man in 1971, several efforts have been made to identify the reservoir of the virus in nature. In July 1985 a study on human enviroments and animals suspected to maintain virus transmission was carried out in northern Zaire. The study revealed three well demarcated areas: the human settlement area, the agricultural area and the primary tropical rain forest. The first two were found inhabited by terrestrial and arboreal rodents and bats, while the large animals have abandoned them. Data on human morbidity collected in the preceding years suggesting that most of the patients were infected either in the settlement or in the agricultural area. Isolation of the virus from a squirrel confirmed this suggestion and proved, on the other hand, that the virus could circulate in an area deprived of the larger wild animals, including primates. The virus isolation and results of serologic testing suggest that out of three!
  groups of animals inhabiting the agricultural area, the squirrels Funisciurus anerythrus should be considered a priority candidate to sustain virus transmission.

AB  - About 3460 persons living in Kole zone of East Kasai, in Zaire, were examined and their sera screened initially by a haemagglutination-inhibition test. Of these, 667 (19%) were positive. Radioimmunoassay adsorption tests for the presence of monkeypox- or vaccinia-specific antibodies gave unequivocal results in 300 of these sera; the remaining 47 were non-specific. Monkeypox-specific antibodies were found in sera of 27 individuals, of all ages and both sexes, giving an overall prevalence rate of monkeypox virus-specific antibodies of 0.8%. The prevalence rate was four times higher in the 5 to 9 year age group (1.3%) than in children aged 0 to 4 years (0.3%), and was highest (2.4%) in the 15 to 19 year age group. There was no significant difference in the prevalence rates between the sexes. As might be expected, there are substantially higher prevalence rates in persons living in forest galleries than in those in savannah, and among those living in areas where human monk!
 eypox cases had occurred in the past compared with those living in other localities. Nineteen children whose sera showed specific monkeypox antibodies were re-examined. Twelve showed facial and body skin changes suggesting the presence of vesiculo-pustular disease in the past; four of these had been known registered monkeypox cases. Seven children had neither signs nor history of past vesiculo-pustular disease, suggesting that they had suffered from subclinical infection with monkeypox virus. At present, the sporadic, infrequency monkey-pox virus infection in man does not appear to constitute a major public health problem.

AB  - The thymidine kinase (TK) gene of Shope fibroma virus (SFV), a tumorigenic leporipoxvirus, was localized within the viral genome with degenerate oligonucleotide probes. These probes were constructed to two regions of high sequence conservation between the vaccinia virus TK gene and those of several known eucaryotic cellular TK genes, including human, mouse, hamster, and chicken TK genes. The oligonucleotide probes initially localized the SFV TK gene 50 kilobases (kb) from the right terminus of the 160-kb SFV genome within the 9.5-kb BamHI-HindIII fragment E. Fine-mapping analysis indicated that the TK gene was within a 1.2-kb AvaI-HaeIII fragment, and DNA sequencing of this region revealed an open reading frame capable of encoding a polypeptide of 176 amino acids possessing considerable homology to the TK genes of the vaccinia, variola, and monkeypox orthopoxiviruses and also to a variety of cellular TK genes. Homology matrix analysis and homology scores suggest that t!
 he SFV TK gene has diverged significantly from its counterpart members in the orthopoxvirus genus. Nevertheless, the presence of conserved upstream open reading frames on the 5' side of all of the poxvirus TK genes indicates a similarity of functional organization between the orthopoxviruses and leporipoxviruses. These data suggest a common ancestral origin for at least some of the unique internal regions of the leporipoxviruses and orthopoxviruses as exemplified by SFV and vaccinia virus, respectively.

AB  - A study of 2,510 contacts of 214 patients with human monkeypox was conducted in Zaire from 1980 to 1984. Among the contacts of 130 primary cases of human monkeypox, a further 22 co-primary and 62 secondary cases were detected, and an additional fourteen people who had no evidence of clinical disease had positive serological results. A majority of the clinical and subclinical cases of mokeypox occurred in children <10 years of age. Immunity in vaccinated persons now appears to be waning because 16 overt cases occurred in contacts who had been vaccinated. The overall attack rate for contacts without a vaccination scar (7.2%) differed significantly from the attack rate for those who had been vaccinated in the past (0.9%). The attack rate for household contacts was significantly higher than that for other contacts, among both unvaccinated (four times higher) and vaccinated (seven times higher) household contacts. Many unvaccinated contacts living in the same household as t!
 he index case under conditions of maximum exposure, however, escaped not only the disease but also infection.

AB  - This paper examines an outbreak of five cases of human monkeypox which occurred in children belonging to two families living in the West Kasai region of Zaire during May-July 1983. Epidemiologic investigations suggest that the first case was infected from an animal source, possibly a monkey, and that each of the other four cases was infected from a previous human case. Three of these cases of presumed person-to-person transmission occurred in close household contacts. The other case infection occurred either by casual contact within the hospital compound, or possible because of infection due to use of the same syringe for injections. Human monkeypox is the most important orthopoxvirus infection in the post-smallpox eradication period. The disease is a zoonosis and person-to-person transmission is rather difficult. Thus, the episode is a rare event and special analysis of the circumstances is discussed. However, it supports the necessity to carry out surveillance and re!
 search on this disease as recently reported by Arita et al.

AB  - The results of the investigation of two outbreaks of group monkeypox infection among humans (altogether 8 cases) in the zone of Bumba. Equatorial Province, Zaire, are presented. The primary source of infection in both outbreaks was not established. the outbreaks were supposedly caused by sick wild animals. Almost all persons affected by this infection were children aged 7 months to 7 years, never vaccinated against smallpox; the only exception was a 29-year old female patient, formerly vaccinated and revaccinated against smallpox. During one of the outbreaks the laboratory-confirmed transmission of infection from man to man was established in two generations. During the other outbreak there were grounds to suspect the transmission of infection in three generations, though the possibility of contacting infection from animals could not be completely ruled out. The existence of the inapparent form of monkeypox in humans was revealed.

AB  - The results are presented of a special study to determine whether variola-like "whitepox" viruses could arise as white pock variants of monkeypox virus after one or a few mutations. DNA mapping by cross-hybridization of restriction endonuclease DNA fragments was carried out on 18 orthopoxviruses relevant to this study, including variola and monkeypox viruses and white (non-haemorrhagic) pock producers recovered from chorioallantoic membranes infected with red (haemorrhagic) pock-producing monkeypox viruses. The distinctiveness of the DNA maps of true variola and monkeypox viruses indicated the spontaneous production of "whitepox" from monkeypox virus was genetically impossible. These and other observations led tothe conclusion that the "whitepox" viruses recovered from monkeypox virus stocks had an exogenous origin.

AB  - During the course of the recently concluded smallpox eradication program, a new human Orthopoxvirus was discovered which is caused by monkeypox (MP) virus. The disease occurs sporadically in remote villages within tropical rain forests of West and Central Africa. The disease is rare; only 155 cases were reported from 1970-19873. The symptoms and signs of human MP resemble those of smallpox, differing significantly only in the occurrence of lymphadenopathy with human MP disease. Of 155 cases, some 80% are believed to have resulted from infection from an as yet unknown animal reservoir; the rest occurred among unvaccinated close contacts among whom a secondary attack rate of 15% was observed. Although person-to-person spread appears to have occurred in some instances, few cases were observed in 3rd or 4th generation of transmission and none thereafter. Since 1982, the incidence of human MP infections in Zaire has increased, concomitant with an intensified survelliance pr!
 ogram. Additional reasons which might explain the increased incidence are discussed. Further surveillance and research of this primarily zoonotic infection are warranted and are in progress.

AB  - Characteristic DNA endonuclease digest fragment electropherograms and restriction site maps permitted differentiation and genome structure analysis of 38 orthopoxviruses that included isolates of monkeypox virus from humans and animals, monkeypox white variants, variola, vaccinia, ectromelia, Tatera (gerbil) and raccoon poxviruses and cowpox and camelpox viruses. HindIII cleavage sites mapped on the 38 virus genome DNA plus SmaI, BglI, SacI, KpnI, XhoI and SalI maps for variola (Harvey) and monkeypox (Copenhagen) virus DNA were derived essentially by cross-hybridizations with monkeypox, vaccinia and variola virus-cloned DNA restriction fragments; thus digest fragments could be assigned homologous regions on previously established genome maps. The DNA HindIII maps correlated to a high degree, but variations in middle and especially terminal DNA region cleavage sites provided a basis for discerning species, strains and variants. The extent of the inverted terminal repeti!
 tions (ITR) for 37 DNA were determined with HindIII, PvuI, SalI and ClaI, plus 9 more restriction enzymes for Bangladesh variola virus DNA by hybridizations with either the terminal tandemly repeated 70-bp (base pair) segment or an EcoRI-PvuI near hairpin-end 75-bp segment from WR vaccinia virus. The opposite terminal regions of variola DNA were considerably asymmetrical compared to the large symmetrical ITR of the other species examined. An apparent DNA inversion and concurrent deletion (1 kibbase pair) with subsequent repair of DNA to original structure was suggested from right terminal region maps of 4 viruses chosen from a variola virus passage series in monkeys. Correlative with virus geographic distribution, 2 strains of monkeypox virus, each containing 2 variants, were differentiated by DNA profiles ofisolates from smallpox-like disease (SLD) patients of the African rainforest region. The DNA of 5 monkeypox viruses isolated from laboratory and zoo animals resembled m!
 ost DNA from SLD monkeypox viruses from Sierra Leone. A poxvir!
 us from 
an American raccoon contained 40% DNA that did not cross-hybridize with orthopoxvirus DNA probes. The DNA of recent isolates from a gerbil and from a canel each mapped as unique African orthopoxvirus species and differed from variola virus.

AB  - A 2.5 yr old boy was hospitalized in May 1982 at Kikwit, Zaire, with a smallpox-like eruptive disease. He died after 10 days. Monkeypox was suspected from the start, and it was diagnosed virologically. There was no suspected source of the virus and there were no secondary cases in his relatives and village, where 82% of children under 4 had not received smallpox vaccination.

AB  - Corresponding DNA fragments from variola (Harvey) and monkeypox (Denmark) viruses which had been cloned into different plasmid vectors were subjected to heteroduplex analysis. Characteristic deletion loops corresponding to differences between the cloning vectors served as internal markers to identify and to orientate the heteroduplexed molecules. Partial denaturation of the resulting heteroduplexes was used as primary screen to locate regions of heterogeneity between the poxvirus inserts. The denaturation threshold for homoduplexes was consistently higher than that for heteroduplexes. Significant sequence divergence between corresponding fragments was indicated by larger than usual difference in thresholds between corresponding homo- and heteroduplexes. Denaturation bubbles of 0.1-0.5 kb [kilobases] were detected and thus small regions of heterogeneity between the genomes (180 kb) of variola and monkeypox viruses were localized. This procedure has a general application!
  in comparative studies on large, complex but closely related DNA molecules.

AB  - A case of monkeypox infection in a 6-mo.-old baby girl who had been bitten by a wild chimpanzee in Kivu, Zaire, was investigated. The child had not been exposed to any monkeypox-like disease and no cases of such disease had occurred in the surrounding area during previous months. The time of onset of rash was consistent with the virus having been transmitted from the chimpanzee. It is still not known whether chimpanzees and other primates or lower mammals are the primary reservoir of monkeypox infection.

AB  - Cytopathological studies have shown that Yaba tumor pox virus (Yaba virus) infection leads to the accumulation of large lipid vacuoles. The rate of accumulation of these vacuoles increased as the infection proceeded. These lipid vacuoles were not seen in control cells or in cells infected with monkeypox virus (MPV) but were seen during Yaba virus infection in the presence of cytosine arabinofuranoside (100 .mu.g/ml). Yaba virus also failed to inhibit host protein synthesis as infection proceeded for prolonged periods. Yaba virus proteins were shown to be substantially different from those of MPV when analyzed by 2-dimensional electrophoresis. The genome of Yaba virus gave restriction enzyme fragments which differed from those of the MPV genome when cleaved with the enzymes HindIII and XhoI. Yaba virus DNA hybridized to the HindIII fragments K, L and M and to the XhoI fragments A, B, C, E and G of MPV DNA. [Monkey kidney cells were used in this study.].

AB  - The thymidine kinase produced in hamster kidney BHK or human cervical carcinoma HeLa cell cultures by several orthopoxviruses was tested for sensitivity to inhibition thymidine triphosphate by (TTP). Thymidine kinase preparations from 11 variola isolates and from 5 whitepox isolates were all found to be sensitive to inhibition by TTP. Preparations from other orthopoxviruses, including vaccinia, cowpox and monkeypox, were all resistant to inhibition by TTP. There was no overlap between the 2 groups of results and no viruses were found which gave intermediate results. Tests with hybrid viruses showed that this character segregated independently of other biological marker characters and is thus a valuable additional marker for variola and variola-related viruses.

AB  - In 1980, the World Health Assembly declared the global eradication of smallpox and recommended the universal discontinuation of smallpox vaccination; nevertheless, it recommended that surveillance and reasearch on orthopoxvirus infections should continue. By early 1982, all but 8 countries in the world had stopped routine vaccination programs and all but 1 no longer required an international certificate of smallpox vaccination for traveller. Since 1978, as a result of continuing active surveillance, 176 smallpox rumors have been investigated in 60 countries. Two of these concerned the 2 laboratory-associated cases that occurred in the UK in 1978; all the others were false alarms. Special surveillance programs for human monkeypox were developed in West and Central Africa. The number of laboratories retaining variola virus stocks was reduced to 4. Investigations to determine the identity and origin of 6 known isolates of whitepox virus have continued. Research on mapping!
  of variola DNA and on monoclonal antibodies against certain orthopoxvirus antigens is continuing. All these measures are aimed at ensuring that the achievement of smallpox eradication is permanent.

AB  - Cross-neutralization tests were done on accepted species and recently isolated members of the genus Orthopoxvirus using rabbit antisera which had been separately absorbed with the various viruses. The involvement of 4 neutralizing antigens and their distribution among 13 virus strains were determined. Monkeypox (Congo-8-Lombe), camelpox (Gorgan), ectromelia (Mill Hill). Lenny and elephant poxviruses had distinctive antigenic formulae. Lister and Wyeth vaccines were indistinguishable but different from Copenhagen and EM63 vaccines which were themselves distinct. Cowpox (Brighton), buffalopox (BP4), MK10 and Moscow poxviruses were indistinguishable. Viruses apparently shared surface antigens but were not all neutralized by antibody to them. This reduced the practical value of the technique for virus identification. The existence in some viruses of a 5th antigen, antibody to which could block neutralization by antibody to 1 particular antigen was found.

AB  - The optimum conditions for determining, and differentiating between the antibodies against closely related poxviruses using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique are reported. This assay was found to be considerably more sensitive than the virus neutralization, hemagglutination inhibition, passive hemagglutination and indirect fluorescent antibody tests for detecting antibodies, but has not yet been compared with radioimmunoassay. The use of ELISA made it possible to differentiate between rabbit antibodies to vaccina, whitepox and monkeypox viruses.

AB  - Serological surveillance of suspected orthopoxvirus infections in man is important for confirming the success of the worldwide smallpox eradication program. An adsorption radioimmunoassay (RIA) was used to differentiate sera from patients who were naturally infected with human monkeypox or variola virus and individuals who were immunized with vaccinia virus. The antisera were absorbed with uninfected chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and vaccinia-infected CAM before reacting in RIA with vaccinia, monkeypox and variola antigens. Each serum group showed characteristic patterns of residual antibody activity which made it possible to identify antibody specificities. When 45 human sera were tested by this method, 71% were identified as having vaccinia, variola or monkeypox adsorption characteristics, while the remaining 29% could not be identified. Of the identified sera, 9 were characteristic of vaccinia, 8 of variola and 15 of monkeypox. Six of the 15 monkeypox sera !
 were virologically confirmed monkeypox infections, 6 were suspected monkeypox infections but were not virologically confirmed and 3 were of unknown etiology. The adsorption RIA provides a method of identifying serologically the poxvirus responsible for infection long after the acute phase of illness.

AB  - The time course synthesis of the polypeptides of monkeypox virus (MPV) in cynomolgus monkey kidney cells was studied by 1-dimensional SDS[sodium dodecyl sulfate]-polyacrylamide and by 2-dimensional polyacrylamide electrophoresis. Cytosine arabinofuranoside (Ara-C) was used to differentiate early and late proteins. The synthesis of several early polypeptides was shown to continue throughout the time course. The synthesis of late polypeptides started at the peak of DNA synthesis (5-7 h postinfection) and continued throughout the remainder of the time course. Some individual polypeptide bands resolved by by 1-dimensional SDS-PAGE [polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis] were shown consisted of multiple polypeptides as shown by 2-dimensional electrophoresis. These multiple polypeptide species, i.e., polypeptides of the same MW but different isoelectric points, represented structural and nonstructural viral proteins. About 115 polypeptides are shown to exist in the purified vir!
 us by using 2-dimensional electrophoresis.

AB  - Monkeypox mutants arising spontaneously or after serial, high multiplicity passage were characterized phenotypically and by restriction endonuclease mapping. Some resemble whitepox and variola viruses in several of the markers tested but all are distinguishable phenotypically from these. None resembles whitepox viruses in genome structure although nearterminal deletions or symmetrical terminal rearrangements relative to parental monkeypox occurred. Whitepox viruses isolated from animals closely resemble variola in phenotype and genome structure.

AB  - Monkeypox, which was first described in Central Africa in 1970, resembles smallpox clinically but differs from it epidemiologically. Since 1970, 47 cases of human monkeypox have occurred in 5 Central and West African countries; 38 of these cases were reported from Zaire. The evolution of the illness and the sequelae of monkeypox and smallpox are the same; monkeypox has a case-fatality rate of about 17%. Children below 10 yr of age comprise 83% of the cases. All cases have occurred in tropical rainforest areas and clustering of cases was observed in certain zones within countries and within families. Person-to-person spread may have occurred in 4 cases; the secondary attack rate among susceptible, very close family members was 7.5% (3 cases/40 contacts) and among all susceptible contacts was 3.3% (4 cases/123 contacts), much lower than the 25-40% secondary attack rate that occurs with smallpox. Although the low transmission rate and the low frequency of disease indicate!
  that monkeypox is not a public health problem, more data are needed. While many animals near human monkeypox cases have been demonstrated to have orthopoxvirus antibodies, the natural reservoir(s) and the vector(s) of monkeypox virus are unknown. Studies are in progress to identify the natural cycle of monkeypox virus and to define better the clinical and epidemiological features of this disease.

AB  - The specificities of antisera during development of the humoral antibody response to poxvirus antigens were examined in monkeys injected with chimp-9 whitepox virus or monkeypox virus. Sera were obtained from 3 African green (vervet) monkeys inoculated with chimp-9 whitepox virus, 1 rhesus monkey inoculated with monkeypox virus and 2 rhesus monkeys inoculated with soluble monkeypox viral antigen. The sequentially obtained sera from each animal were adsorbed with uninfected chicken chorioallantoic membranes (CAM) or vaccinia virus-infected CAM. The adsorbed sera were tested by radioimmunoassay to determine the specificity of the residual antibodies to vaccinia, variola and monkeypox viruses. The adsorbed sera at different stages of the immune response showed increasing specificity with time after inoculation. Generally, antibodies in sera collected earlier than 21-27 days after immunization could not be identified after adsorption but late sera could be identified unequ!
 ivocally.

AB  - Structural polypeptides from a number of poxviruses were analyzed by SDS[sodium dodecyl sulfate]-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The patterns obtained with orthopoxviruses were generally quite similar, but variola, monkeypox, cowpox and vaccinia viruses were distinguished by their profiles in the MW region around 30,000-40,000; some additional variation was found among cowpox and vaccinia strains. Whitepox virus had structural polypeptides indistinguishable from those of variola virus. The structural polypeptides of poxviruses belonging to other genera were different from those of the orthopoxvirus, except those of MW about 122,000 and 97,000, which were common to all viruses irrespective of genus. A polypeptide of MW about 25,000 was also observed in all cases, though its position varied slightly with the individual virus.

AB  - Until recently, virus carrier state in the absence of overt clinical infection was known for only 1 species of orthopoxviruses, i.e., ectromelia virus. The results of the modeling of asymptomatic infection caused by monkeypox, cowpox and ratpox viruses were studied. Persistence of these viruses up to 6 wk in animals (hamsters, cotton and white rats) with experimental asymptomatic infection and in apparently normal naturally infected white rats was established by isolation of virus from the organs of these animals. Asymptomatic virus carrier state may occur both with ectromelia and a number of other orthopoxviruses. This mechanism may be of ecological importance, providing for circulation of these viruses and their preservation as biological species in nature.

AB  - To prepare highly specific antiserum to variola virus, a chimpanzee was inoculated with a virulent human strain of this virus. Three uninoculated chimpanzees were housed in the same room; 2 of these developed clinical disease with seroconversion, while the 3rd developed no evidence of infection and no antibody. The 3 animals that became ill developed antibody to vaccinia and monkeypox viruses. Human contacts during the study and following a break in containment showed no evidence of infection as determined by serological tests and lack of clinical disease.

AB  - Orthopoxvirus DNA from representative strains of rabbitpox, vaccinia, monkeypox, variola, cowpox and ectromelia viruses was analyzed by cleavage with restriction endonucleases HindIII, XhoI or SmaI. Genome MW vary from about 120 .times. 106 for rabbitpox to about 145 .times. 106 for cowpox. Physical maps of cleavage sites are similar and characteristic for strains of the same Orthopoxvirus type. The distribution of HindIII sites suggest that an internal region of MW about 30 .times. 106 is highly conserved between Orthopoxvirus genomes although some type-specific differences occur within this region, especially with strains of ectromelia virus. Conservation of internal sequences is less marked following analysis with XhoI although cleavages within this central region of particular genomes appear to represent a subset of preferred sites. Endonuclease SmaI cleaves exceptionally infrequently and distinguishes variola, monkeypox, vaccinia, cowpox or ectromelia viruses. Typ!
 e specific differences result largely from extensive, near terminal variations in length and sequence. Representative Orthopoxvirus genomes have rapidly renaturing terminal restriction fragments confirming the presence of near terminal, covalent cross-links. Terminal restriction fragments from the same or different genomes generally cross hybridize indicating the presence of near terminal repetitions of MW up to 6 .times. 106 and which share at least a subset of common sequences. Variola strains appear to lack such sequences from one specific terminus which maps shorter than that of related viruses.

AB  - The structural polypeptides of accepted species and recently isolated members of the genus Orthopoxvirus were examined by SDS[sodium dodecyl sulfate]-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The viruses shared many polypeptides but some differences were found. The viruses could be divided into a vaccinia group (including buffalopox, 'Lenny' and MK-10), an ectromelia group (including elephant virus and Moscow virus), cowpox, camelpox and monkeypox. Minor differences were found in the polypeptides of monkeypox virus strains from human and monkey outbreaks. Controlled degradation of virions showed that the polypeptides which enabled the viruses to be differentiated were located in the surface and sub-surface layers. The cores of the viruses all gave the same complex polypeptide pattern.

AB  - The phylogenetic closeness of monkeys, their origins modes of commercialization and the problems of their maintainance expose laboratory personnel to specific and serious hazards. These risks are evaluated according to the following classification: particularly severe zoonoses [virus B infection, Marburg's disease and rabies], severe zoonoses [viral hepatitis, monkeypox, salmonelloses-shigelloses, tuberculosis and amoebiasis], relatively benign zoonoses [Yaba's disease and various parasitic affections] and potential zoonoses [tularemia, pseudotuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, leprosy, melioidosis and cytomegalovirus disease]. The precociousness of the monkey risk is particularly underlined. A prophylactic approach is proposed, based on strict quarantine according to precise practical rules and permanent, less specific, sanitary measures.

AB  - Various strains of vaccinia, variola, whitepox, monkeypox and cowpox viruses were examined for their capacity to induce a specific early antigen detectable on the surface of infected [chick embryo and cynomolgus monkey kidney] cells. The Elstree strain of vaccinia, 2 strains of variola minor and white variants of cowpox and monkeypox viruses lacked the capacity to induce the antigen. Variation of the parent cowpox and monkeypox viruses to white variants was always accompanied by the loss of the antigen-inducing capacity.

AB  - Monkeypox virus cloning and isolation of the so-called white clones from white pocks which this virus forms on the [chick embryo] chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) were carried out. The isolated clones were stable and differed considerably from the parental stain. By their properties, they were identical to whitepox viruses formerly isolated from wildlife monkeys and rodents in Equatorial Africa. Besides stable white clones, a number of virus cultures in the process of cloning were obtained which differed in quantitative content of virions, forming on CAM white pocks and pocks with hemorrhages. The properties of the viral population as a whole (reaction type on rabbit skin, hemagglutination activity, etc.) depended on the rate of virions produced with different characteristics.

AB  - Orthopoxvirus were compared by means of their late intracellular polypeptides (ICP). HeLa [human cervical carcinoma] cells were labeled with [35S]methionine at 16 h after infection and the ICP were analyzed by SDS[sodium dodecyl sulfate]-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Time course and pulse-chase studies confirmed the significance of the differences observed. ICP in 3 regions of the gels (MW 177,000, 96-103,000 and 15,500) permitted an initial grouping of the 24 viruses examined into 4 main groups (cowpox, monkeypox, vaccinia, and variola-related viruses). Only cowpox-like viruses had a prominent ICP of MW 177,000 and only monkeypox-like viruses had a heavily labeled ICP of MW 15,500. Viruses in these 2 groups appeared to have only a single ICP in the 96-103,000 region (MW, 98,000). Vaccinia-like viruses and variola-like viruses had 2 ICP in this region but were distinguished because the ICP of vaccinia were of higher MW and were apparently reve!
 rsed with respect to those of variola-like viruses. This was supported by the disappearance on chase of the lower MW vaccinia ICP and the higher MW variola ICP. The significance of these results and their use in the identification of orthopoxvirus isolates, particularly whitepox viruses, was discussed.

AB  - Replication of vaccinia and monkeypox viruses was impeded in the presence of 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR) in RL-33 cells derived from rabbit lung tissue. A different degree of inhibition was found among strains of those viruses, in which it was evident that 5 strains (CV-1, Lister, IHD, Dairen-I and Ikeda) of vaccinia viruses had more reduced yields of infectious virus than 4 strains (Sen-19, Orang Utan, Copenhagen and Sierra Leone) of monkeypox viruses. There was also strain variation in BUdR sensitivity within vaccinia viruses but not in the case of monkeypox viruses. [This observation adds an additional in vitro marker for distinguishing these 2 groups of viruses.].

AB  - Procedures were developed for purifying intact intracytoplasmic poxvirus particles from infected [human ammion FL] cells and for isolating DNA from virions by equilibrium centrifugation in sodium diatrizoate density gradients. The buoyant density of 12 closely related orthopoxviruses purified in these gradients was determined to be 1.25 g/ml, and that of the isolated virion DNA was 1.1 g/ml. Virion DNA from each of the 12 selected prototype and wild-type viruses was cleaved with 3 separate site-specific restriction endonucleases HindIII, SalI and BamHI, and the fragments (MW 0.5 .times. 106 to 20 .times. 106) were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Characteristic DNA fragment migration patterns observed in the gels permitted classification of the viruses. Comparing profiles of HindIII cleaved DNA enabled the grouping of the viruses into 4 spp.: cowpox, vaccinia, monkeypox (2 isolates) and variola (8 isolates). Viruses from variola major infection could be differ!
 entiated from viruses from variola minor infection. Isolates within species (strains) were also differentiated, mainly by comparing the gel electrophoresis profiles of SalI digested DNA from the viruses.

AB  - Monkeypox virus causing in M. rhesus [Macaca mulatta] upon aerogenic infection a disease similar to human varioloid was used to evaluate the intensity of immunity against smallpox in immunized M. rhesus monkeys. Postvaccination immunity was solid in all the animals vaccinated intradermally or orally. In 2 out of 14 monkeys immunized orally, the immunity was partially overcome. Neutralizing antibody titers in these 2 monkeys were 1:5 and 1:25, respectively. This agreed with the observations made in Pakistan indicating the possibility that some humans having serum neutralizing antibody titers up to 1:32 could contract smallpox and develop the disease.

AB  - Twenty strains of Orthopox viruses (vaccinia (3), cowpox (2), monkeypox (2), variola major and minor (7) and whitepox (6)) were tested by electrofocusing in a granulated gel. There is a clearcut distinction between smallpox and whitepox. If the results are confirmed, it is the 1st real genetic marker identified because other in vitro or in vivo tests heretofore failed to differentiate between smallpox and whitepox.
