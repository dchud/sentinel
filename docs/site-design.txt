Introduction
------------

This document captures the design plan of the Canary Database Project
backend system.  It denotes the design by describing the variety of urls
available in the project, and what classes of actions, and required user
permissions, are available at each.  This document should be kept up
to date with the entire state of the backend codebase, and all changes
to the url design or permissions model should be listed completely and
noted with a change entry.

By documenting the code in this manner I hope everyone working with
the site will be able to quickly review this single document to gain a
complete view of the site's intended capabilities, and its design history.



Permissions model
-----------------

Our authentication/authorization system is rather basic.  Users can be
logged in or not.  Anyone using the system without being logged in is
"anonymous".  Users can only log in if they have been given an account by
an administrator (i.e. there is currently no way to "sign yourself up" for
a new account).  Users with accounts can have zero, one, or more roles:
roles include "editor" and "administrator".  An "editor" is someone
with the authority to review and curate studies.  An "administrator"
has the authority to perform system-level tasks such as managing users
and their roles, source records, or maintenance tasks.

If a user is not logged in, they will have access to all public parts of
the site, with no ability to perform any restricted actions.  Attempts to
access restricted parts of the site by an anonymous user will send
the user to a login screen where they must enter a valid user id and
password.  If they do not enter a valid id/pass, they will be shown an
"Access Denied" screen.  If they do enter a valid id/pass, the system
will check whether they are authorized to perform the restricted action;
if not, they will be also receive an "Access Denied" screen.  If they
do have the appropriate permission (i.e. an administrator attempting
to access an administrative page), they will be redirected to the
page.

Restrictions within the site cascade down from a top-level url path:
in other words, if a given top-level path is restricted to a certain
class of users, all urls below that will also be restricted.  "Level"
here means "part of the url between two slashes", e.g. "/admin/"
refers to the top-level "admin" path, and "/admin/user/dchud" is
a lower-level path "under" "admin".  The "/admin/" top-level path
is restricted to logged-in users with adminstrator privleges, so
any attempt to access any url under "/admin/" will check first that
a user is authenticated (logged in) and authorized (has the right
permissions), and insufficiently authenticated or authorized users
will be denied access.

Similar restrictions will be listed with their corresponding url
paths in the next section.



Site design by url
------------------

Should be read left-to-right, and strung together for a particular
url.  Required permissions are denoted for a given top-level path
are listed in the form {role:[permission_name]} directly under their
path.  All unauthenticated users attempting to access a restricted
path will be rerouted through /user/login; those lacking proper
access will be redirected to /error/denied.

Automatic redirections for a url are listed as {redirect:[new_path]}.
