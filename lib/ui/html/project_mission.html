<h2>Canary Database Project Mission</h2>

<p>
The Canary Database aims to overcome scientific barriers which limit the
use of animal sentinel data to reduce human environmental health hazards.
These barriers include:
</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

    <li>Difficulty locating animal sentinel studies in current biomedical
    databases</li>

    <li>Lack of communication between human health and animal health
    professionals regarding the investigation of environmental health
    hazards</li>

    <li>Scientific uncertainty regarding the human health relevance of
    many health events occurring in animal populations.</li>

</ol>


<p>
The Database Project will overcome such barriers by accomplishing the
following aims:
</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

    <li>Make the scientific literature on animals as sentinels of human
    environmental hazards more accessible.</li>

    <li>Promote collaborative responses to reports of sentinel events in
    animal populations and the environment by human and animal scientists
    and public health professionals.</li>

    <li>Improve communication between the disciplines of human environmental
    health and animal health by helping to develop a common language of
    epidemiology for the study of sentinel health events.</li>

    <li>Bring together highly experienced human and animal health
    professionals, as well as experts in environmental science and medical
    informatics.</li>

</ol>
