<h2>Canary Database Mission</h2>

<p>
The Canary Database aims to overcome scientific barriers which
limit the use of animal sentinel data for early recognition of
human environmental health hazards.  These barriers include
<em>difficulty in locating animal sentinel studies</em> in
current biomedical databases and a <em>lack of communication</em>
between human health and animal health professionals.
</p>

<p>
The Canary Database will overcome such barriers by making the
scientific literature on animals as sentinels of human environmental
hazards more <em>accessible in a single location</em>.
