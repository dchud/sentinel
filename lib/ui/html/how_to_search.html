<h2>How to Search the Canary Database</h2>


<p>
During the initial development of the Canary Database, curated studies
can be searched by:
</p>


<ul>

    <li>
    <b>Keyword</b>: matches when all terms are found in any of the
    title, authors, or abstracts of curated studies.
    </li>

    <li>
    <b>Author</b>: matches author names in the form "Lastname FM", where
    'F' and 'M' are first and middle initials; this is adopted directly
    from MEDLINE convention.  For best results, search on the last name
    only.
    </li>

    <li>
    <b>Title</b>: matches terms found only in the titles of curated
    studies.
    </li>

</ul>


<p>
We are currently developing the database model and indexing
strategies for the Canary Database.  Because the studies we curate will
include information from a variety of abstracting and indexing sources,
we are exploring ways to make advanced searching capabilities easy to
use across these source records.  We expect to offer a flexible advanced
search feature soon.
</p>


<p>
You can also browse the database by
        <a href='/browse/year'>year</a>,
        <a href='/browse/journal'>journal</a>,
        <a href='/browse/study_type'>study type</a>, or by
        <a href='/browse/heading'>subject heading</a>.
</p>
