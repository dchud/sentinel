<h2>How to Search the Canary Database</h2>


<p>
Presently, the database search interface uses a general keyword
search.  This interface will match records where keyword terms
are found in any of the title, authors, or abstracts of curated
studies.
</p>

<p>
We are currently developing the database model and indexing
strategies for the Canary Database.  Because the studies we curate will
include information from a variety of abstracting and indexing sources,
we are exploring ways to make advanced searching capabilities easy to
use across these source records.  We expect to offer a flexible advanced
search feature soon.
</p>


<p>
You can also browse the database by
    <a href='/browse/year'>year</a>,
    <a href='/browse/journal'>journal</a>, or by
    <a href='/browse/methodology'>methodology</a>.
