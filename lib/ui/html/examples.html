<h2>Examples of Known Animal Sentinels</h2>


<p>
Several episodes of illness in animals have been clearly linked to a
human health threat:
</p>


<ul>

    <li><b>Canaries and Carbon monoxide:</b>

        <p>
At the end of the 19th century, coal miners in England and the US brought
canaries into coal mines as an "early warning signal" for carbon monoxide
and other poisonous gases. The birds, being more sensitive, would become
sick before the miners, who would then have a chance to escape or put on
protective respirators.
        </p>

    </li>


    <li><b>Cats and Mercury Poisoning:</b>

        <p>
The outbreak of methylmercury poisoning among residents of Minamata,
Japan, was preceded by the emergence of "Dancing Cat Disease": abnormal
movements and neurologic function in cats. The cats, feeding principally
on contaminated fish from the harbor, showed symptoms of mercury poisoning
before children began being born with birth defects due to mercury
exposure.
        </p>

    </li>


    <li><b>Crows and West Nile Virus:</b>

        <p>
The discovery of West Nile Virus in the western hemisphere was heralded
by an outbreak of disease in wild birds.
        </p>

    </li>

</ul>

<h2>Possible Animal Sentinel Events</h2>

<p>
Recent reports of adverse health events in animal populations have
triggered concern that an environmental hazard important to human health
could be responsible. However, further scientific study is needed to
determine whether the animal populations are actually signaling that
something is happening in the environment which could pose a direct
hazard to humans.
</p>

<p>
Examples include:
</p>

<ul>

    <li>Cancer in Beluga whales of the St. Lawrence estuary, possibly
    due to chemical contaminants</li>

    <li>Abnormal sexual development in Florida Alligators</li>

    <li>Limb deformities and mortality in frogs and other amphibians</li>

    <li>A recent outbreak of monkeypox traced to imported African rodents</li>

</ul>
