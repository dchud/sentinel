<h2>Database Description</h2>

<p>
The CANARY Database facilitates the use of animal sentinel data by
creating a collection of curated animal sentinel studies that will be
available to human and animal health professionals via the Internet.
</p>

<p>
This relational database contains the fields that are standard for
bibliographic databases such as MEDLINE. In addition, the database also
includes curated information relevant to animal sentinels.
</p>

<p>
For a complete list of fields, see our <a href='/about/glossary'>Glossary</a>.
</p>


<h2>Studies in the Database</h2>

<p>
To be included in the database, a study must meet the following criteria:
</p>

<ul>

    <li>
The study must include a "non-traditional" animal species or population,
wildlife, companion and other domestic animals (e.g., livestock and
poultry).
    </li>

    <li>
Either the exposure or the health effect must be judged as potentially
relevant to human health.
    </li>

</ul>


<h2>What Curators Add</h2>

<p>
For each study, the curator has added information about the species
studied, the type of hazard and outcome, and the study methodology used.

<h2>Additional Features</h2>

<p>
The database also includes links to online databases including PubMed and
the NCBI taxonomy. This allows the user to search for related articles
and explore possible links between animal and human health.

<h2>Suggested Uses</h2>

<ul>

    <li>
    Look for associations between specific hazards and outcomes in animal
    populations that could be a model for cause-effect relationships in
    humans
    </li>

    <li>
    Look for examples of animals serving as an "early warning" for
    particular hazards
    </li>

    sentinel events
