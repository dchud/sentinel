<h2>What Are Animal Sentinels?</h2>

<p>
Whereas indicators and monitors are species used to assess ecosystem effects
of contamination, <b>sentinels</b> refer directly to human health and are defined
as "organisms in which changes in known characteristics can be measured to
assess the extent of environmental contamination and its implication for
human health and to provide early warning of those implications."
(O'Brien 1993)

<h3>Canary in the Coal Mine:  Animals as Sentinels of Human Environmental
Health Hazards</h3>

<p>
<b>At the end</b> of the 19th century, coal miners in England and the US brought
canaries into coal mines as an "early warning signal" for carbon monoxide
and other poisonous gases. The birds, being more sensitive, would become
sick before the miners, who would then have a chance to escape or put on
protective respirators.
</p>

<p>
<b>In recent years</b>, a growing number of reports of adverse health effects in
animal populations have prompted concerns about risks to human health from
environmental hazards. Examples include developmental abnormalities and
population declines in amphibians, reproductive anomalies in fish, whales
and reptiles, and behavioral disturbances in nesting bird populations.
The discovery of West Nile Virus in the western hemisphere was heralded
by an outbreak of disease in wild birds.
</p>

<p>
<b>Today</b>, as human civilization exerts an ever-increasing impact on the global
environment, there is an urgent need to quickly identify and understand
hazards to human health due to environmental change. If wildlife and other
animal populations could serve as an effective "early warning system" for
environmental health threats to humans, it could have a profound influence
on public health practice and environmental health policy.
</p>

<p>
<b>In the future</b> we will see more disease and population changes in animal
populations. How should the scientific community as well as local communities
respond to such events?  Are the animal populations actually signaling
that something is happening in the environment which could pose a direct
hazard to humans? How can such linkages between ecosystem events and human
health be made in a scientifically valid and useful manner?
</p>

<p>
<b>The Canary Database Project seeks answers to these questions.</b>

<h3>What Makes a Good Animal Sentinel?</h3>

<p>
A recent article on animal sentinels outlined several characteristics of
a good animal sentinel (Stephen, C. R., C. (2001). "Death, disease and
deformity." Global change and human health 2(2): 108-117).

<ol>

    <li>
It must warn of an impending danger before the risk can be realized in the
communities that we are concerned about, and in time to act to prevent
adverse health outcomes.
    </li>

    <li>
It must provide information that has reliable predictive ability.
    </li>

    <li>
It must provide information that is interpretable and relevant to the
health and well-being of people so as to convince decision makers to act
accordingly.
