<b>Zimra Gordon, DVM, MPH</b> (Research Associate)
Conceived and raised in an antiquarian bookstore in Rhode Island, Zimra
read an alarming range of literature and nurtured the wide range of small
animals that would homestead in the dusty crevices. Gravitating to Tufts
veterinary school she helped investigate the causes of morbidity and
mortality of Common Loons.  Five years after entering private practice
she obtained a MPH from Yale so that she could investigate the
interrelationships among animal and human diseases and the environment.
