in terms of history of previous exposures, thereby moving backward in
time. Case-control studies are often considered backward directional
studies.

disease agent, such as inorganic lead or the Lyme disease spirochete
Borrellia Burgdorferi.  Factors noted by curators could also include host
susceptibility factors such as age, species, or gender, as well as
environmental factors such as "urbanization" or "climate change". These
causative factors relate to the animal population being studied, and do
not necessarily correlate with human health risk.

        <td align='left' valign='top'>
According to the classification algorithm, identifies whether the study
used control animals from the same population as the affected animals
(Yes or No). For example, many studies compare control animals from an
"uncontaminated" reference site to animals from a "contaminated" site.
In this case, the control field would indicate "no", controls not drawn
from the same population.

According to the classification algorithm, records whether animals were
sampled according to outcome (health effect) or exposure (environmental
hazard). For example, in a case-control study, sampling would be by
outcome, while in a cohort study, it would be by exposure.  In a
cross-sectional study, sampling could be by either outcome or exposure,
since these are measured simultaneously.
