        <td>
        According to the classification algorithm, identifies whether the
        study used control animals from the same population as the affected
        animals (Yes or No). For example, many studies compare control
        animals from an "uncontaminated" reference site to animals from
        a "contaminated" site.  In this case, the control field would
        indicate "no", controls not drawn from the same population.

        in other fields.  There is no specific format for this field and

        Human studies of association
        </td>
        <td>
        Describes the strength of evidence linking the principal exposure to the relevant human health outcome, based on a Medline search. For each study, we will identify a MeSH term (National Library of Medicine's Medical Subject Headings) associated with the study citation, or a key word from the article, that represents the most specific and important environmental exposure studied.  Similarly, we will select a MeSH term or key word representing the relevant human health outcome.  If more than one exposure or outcome receives equal weight in the analysis, multiple terms may be used.  For infectious disease studies, exposure and outcome terms may be the same.  We will conduct a Medline search for the intersection of the exposure and outcome terms, limited to human studies and excluding review articles.  We will classify each study entered into the database according to the number of human studies identified in this manner, using four categories: zero studies, zero to 10, 11-20, and greater than 20. This will give some idea whether the hazard is considered to pose a human health threat.  However, critical evaluation of the strength of the association is beyond the scope of this effort.

        Sampling
        </td>
        <td>According to the classification algorithm, records whether animals were sampled according to outcome (health effect) or exposure (environmental hazard). For example, in a case-control study, sampling would be by outcome, while in a cohort study, it would be by exposure.  In a cross-sectional study, sampling could be by either outcome or exposure, since these are measured simultaneously.
