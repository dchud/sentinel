<h2>Database Project Advisory Board</h2>

<p>
The professional advisory board of the Canary Database Project includes experts
in human epidemiology, veterinary medicine, toxicology, infectious diseases,
disease surveillance, medical informatics, and library science.
</p>

<p>
<b>Joanna Burger PhD</b>, Rutgers University. Dr. Burger is an environmental
toxicologist and ecologist who has published numerous scientific papers on
effects of heavy metals and other environmental toxins on wild animals and
humans. She was an author of the 1997 EPA report on the use of animals as
sentinels of human environmental health hazards.

<b>Mark R. Cullen, MD</b>, Professor of Medicine and Public Health at Yale
University School of Medicine, and Director, Yale Occupational and Environmental
Medicine Program.  Dr. Cullen brings to the advisory board his expertise
in clinical occupational and environmental medicine, as well as environmental
health epidemiology. His work includes clinical aspects of occupational
and environmental diseases, occupational lung diseases, effects of
socio-economic status and work organization on occupational injury and
diseases.

<b>Peter Daszak, B.Sc., Ph.D.</b> Executive Director, Consortium for
Conservation Medicine   Dr. Daszak directs the Consortium's programs in
research, education, policy, and practical conservation. He is originally
from Britain, where he earned a B.Sc. in zoology and a Ph.D. in parasitology.
His research focuses on the taxonomy, pathology, and conservation impact
of parasitic diseases, particularly those of non-mammalian vertebrates
and invertebrates. In collaboration with groups in Britain, Australia,
and the United States, he discovered a previously unknown fungal disease
of amphibians that is a major cause of frog population declines globally
and may be transmitted by bullfrogs. This discovery highlights the link
between global trade and disease emergence, a process known as pathogen
pollution.

<b>Ann Fairbrother, DVM, PhD,</b> Chief, Ecosystem Characterization Branch,
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Dr. Fairbrother played a key
role in the creation of the 1991 National Academy of Sciences report
entitled "Animals as Sentinels of Environmental Hazards".
</p>

<p>
<b>Durland Fish, PhD</b>, Associate Professor of Epidemiology, Department
of Epidemiology and Public Health, Yale University School of Medicine.
Professor Fish's area of research interest is the ecology of vector-borne
infectious diseases. Recent emphasis has been on tick-borne pathogens
causing Lyme disease and human ehrlichiosis, and on mosquito-borne West
Nile virus. Current projects include experimental manipulation of natural
transmission cycles, interactions among multiple pathogens in vectors and
hosts, vector competence for viral and bacterial pathogens, and spatial
analysis of pathogen prevalence using satellite imagery and geographic
information systems

<p>
<b>Henry S. Gardner, MD</b>, Associate Vice President for Research at
Colorado State University. Previously he was director of the US Army Center
for Environmental Health Research. Dr. Gardner is an expert in the use of
animal sentinels, and is one of the authors of the 1991 NAS report.
</p>

<p>
<b>Tracey S. McNamara, DVM</b>, Schiff Family Distinguished Scientist in
Wild Animal Pathology and Head of Pathology at the Wildlife Conservation
Society, Bronx Zoo, New York .  Dr. McNamara is the discoverer of the West
Nile virus outbreak and has developed a nationwide surveillance system of
zoo veterinarians. She has lectured extensively on the use of animal
surveillance for preparedness for emerging infectious diseases, including
biological terrorist threats.
</p>

<p>
<b>Perry Miller, MD, PhD</b>, Director of the Yale Center for Medical
Informatics, Yale University School of Medicine. Dr. Miller has expertise
in medical informatics and biomedical library systems.
</p>

<p>
<b>Constance Rinaldo, MS</b>, Librarian, Ernst Mayr Library at the Museum
of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University, has expertise in medical
and zoological library systems.
</p>

<p>
<b>Judy Zelikoff</b>, NYU, Associate Professor at the New York
University School of Medicine Department of Environmental Medicine. She
has published research on the effects of toxins on immune function in
fish as a model for human environmental health concerns.
