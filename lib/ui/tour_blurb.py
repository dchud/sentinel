            Beluga whales of the St. Lawrence estuary (SLE) have been found to have cancer rates "much higher than those observed in domestic animals and humans, except in sheep in certain parts of the world, where environmental contaminants are believed to be involved in the etiology of this condition. SLE beluga and their environment are contaminated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) produced by the local aluminum smelters. The human population living in proximity of the SLE beluga habitat is affected by rates of cancer higher than those found in people in the rest of Quebec and Canada, and some of these cancers have been epidemiologically related to PAHs."
