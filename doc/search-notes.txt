General notes on working with pylucene and search strategy.

2005-03-11: canary concept term boosting, umls synonyms

    - term boosting: simple, just call setBoost() on each term
    - synonym "injection": just cycle in synonyms at index-time,
      no need for complex analyzers yet.  maybe later, if we
      do concept indexing of titles and abstracts

2005-03-09: general search working.  general notes/issues:

    - key canary concepts need to be boosted:
        - exposures, outcomes, species, risk_factors,
          though maybe _not_ locations
        - quick test via ui indicates a boost of at least 1.2
          should be sufficient
    - synonym injection necessary for all umls concepts
    - add in canary record status info; calling client can
      grow out user query for "is-curated:1" and "is-irrelevant:0"
      etc. depending on UI component
    - MeSH, Taxonomy hierarchy searching necessary
    - UI will be a thorny one :)
