Quick installation notes
------------------------

Canary is a python application written using version one of the Quixote
web framework.  It uses MySQL as a datastore and for session management.
The scgi module provides a persistent connector that apache attaches to
so the site delivers decent response time.


Source information
------------------

The canary library is stored in a subversion repository accessible at
http://curtis.med.yale.edu/svn/canary.

The canary library uses a python-standard distutils script, so it can
be installed via "python setup.py install", and a source tarball can be
created via "python setup.py sdist", etc.  Note though that setup.py
uses the extra Quixote distutil hook, so the quixote library must be
present and available to python or canary will not install properly.


Baseline dependencies:
---------------------

All of the following are REQUIRED:

- Python 2.3.5+
- apache1 or apache2 w/support for DSOs
- MySQL-4.1+
- MySQL-python-1.2+
- quixote-1.2 (*not* quixote-2)
  - be sure to add form2 in setup.py
- Dulcinea-0.1 (not anything later! they are incompatible)
- scgi-1.2+
- egenix-mx-base-2.0.6+ (mx.DateTime required by qx_defs.Session stuff
- pyparsing-1.3+
- PyLucene-0.9.8+
- Python Imaging Library-1.1.5+
- matplotlib-0.83+ (many of its own dependencies, including Numeric/NumArray)
- elementtree-1.2.6+
- simplejson-1.1+


The following are OPTIONAL:

- memcached >= 1.11 (running somewhere) 
- python-memcached >= 1.2


App configuration:
-----------------

- Install all REQUIRED dependencies listed above
- Install mod_scgi into apache as appropriate, and scgi python module
- Configure mod_scgi access within apache's httpd.conf, something like
  this:

  LoadModule scgi_module modules/mod_scgi.so
  <VirtualHost *>

      ServerName canarydb.med.yale.edu
      ServerAlias canarydb
      ServerAdmin daniel.chudnov_at_yale.edu

      CustomLog /home/dlc33/sites/canarydb.med.yale.edu/logs/canarydb.access.log combined
      ErrorLog /home/dlc33/sites/canarydb.med.yale.edu/logs/canarydb.error.log

      <Location "/">
          SetHandler scgi-handler
          SCGIServer localhost:4001
          SCGIHandler On
      </Location>

      # Get images directly from the filesystem.
      Alias /images "/home/dlc33/sites/canarydb.med.yale.edu/current/canary/ui/images"
      <Location /images>
          SCGIHandler Off
          SetHandler None
      </Location>

  </VirtualHost>

  - Notes:
    - mod_scgi has to be enabled
    - The virtual host is not required, but is helpful
    - Define a log location; combined is best to use w/awstats
    - Canary's bin/scgi_handler defaults to port 4001, to change
      it needs to be updated both there and here
    - The alias for /images means images don't go through scgi/qx

- Install canary (python setup.py install)
- Copy conf/canary_config.py.sample to conf/canary_config.py
  and configure accordingly, notes as follows:
  - Several canary_config vars "override" default quixote vars;
    additional canary-specific vars are defined here and in 
    canary/qx_defs.MyConfig
  - Create mysql database using schema from doc/database-schema.sql
    and set DB_*
  - Create log directory and set LOG_DIR
  - Create temp directory for canary-generated images and set
    TEMP_IMAGE_DIR
  - Configure USE_CACHE and CACHE_SERVER_LIST if memcached to be used
    (and turn on your memcached :)



Starting/stopping canary
------------------------

The bin/startup.sh script initializes the persistent scgi handler
for canary at bin/scgi_handler.py.  This creates scgi.log (handler
log) and scgi.pid) (handler process id) in the top-level directory
For simple restarts (changes in web templates only) bin/restart.py
will kill all child processes of the handler, forcing template
recompilation.  For configuration and all other changes, kill
the parent scgi_handler.py process identified by scgi.pid, then
run bin/startup.sh again.

Initialization of the scgi_handler can be done at boot time via
installation and configuration of the simple chkconfig script at 
bin/canary-initscript.sh.


Backups/cronjobs
----------------

Highly recommend to run at minimum a nightly script for data backups
from mysql, and a separate script to sync the backed up data to a
remote location.  These are installed and running on the main canary
server.

A "reaper" script can be run (recommended as hourly) via a web url 
to clean out old temp images and old user sessions.  This is available
at CANARY_URL/reaper and not exactly secure. :)
